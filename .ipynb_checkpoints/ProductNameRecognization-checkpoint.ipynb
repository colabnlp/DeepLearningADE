The assay enables the measurement of OLM and AM for therapeutic drug monitoring with a minimum detectable limit of 2 ng mL. The method involves a simple, one-step extraction procedure and analytical recovery was above 50%. The separation was performed on an analytical 250 \\u00d7 4.6 mm Eurospher 100(-5) C18 column. The wavelength was set at 239 nm. The mobile phase was a mixture of acetonitrile:0.05 M ammonium acetate buffer: 0.1 mL triethylamine at pH 6.8 was selected at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min. The calibration curve for the determination of OLM and AM in plasma was linear over the range 2-2500 and 8-10,000 ng mL AM and OLM. The coefficients of variation for interday and intraday assay were found to be <15%. The method can be applied to a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of OLM and AM in a combined dosage form.\"}\n",

      "Previous studies have demonstrated that glucocorticoid hormones, including dexamethasone, induced alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. However, the mechanism by which intracellular calcium homeostasis participates in dexamethasone sensitivity and resistance on ALL cells remains elusive. Here, we found that treatment of cells with dexamethasone resulted in increased intracellular calcium concentrations through store-operated calcium entry stimulation, which was curtailed by store-operated calcium channel blockers. We show that BAPTA-AM, an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, synergistically enhances dexamethasone lethality in two human ALL cell lines and in three primary specimens. This effect correlated with the inhibition of the prosurvival kinase ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Chelating intracellular calcium with Bapta-AM or inhibiting ERK1/2 with PD98059 significantly potentiated dexamethasone-induced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release, caspase-3 activity, and cell death. Moreover, we show that thapsigargin elevates intracellular free calcium ion level, and activates ERK1/2 signaling, resulting in the inhibition of dexamethasone-induced ALL cells apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that calcium-related ERK1/2 signaling pathway contributes to protect cells from dexamethasone sensitivity by limiting mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This report provides a novel resistance pathway underlying the regulatory effect of dexamethasone on ALL cells.\n",
