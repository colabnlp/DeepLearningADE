{"keyword": "Pear", "texts": "Pear (Pyrus; 2n\u00a0=\u00a034), the third most important temperate fruit crop, has great nutritional and economic value. Despite the availability of many genomic resources in pear, it is challenging to genotype novel germplasm resources and breeding progeny in a timely and cost-effective manner. Genotyping arrays can provide fast, efficient and high-throughput genetic characterization of diverse germplasm, genetic mapping and breeding populations. We present here 200K AXIOM\u00ae PyrSNP, a large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array to facilitate genotyping of Pyrus species. A diverse panel of 113 re-sequenced pear genotypes was used to discover SNPs to promote increased adoption of the array. A set of 188 diverse accessions and an F1 population of 98 individuals from 'Cuiguan'\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0'Starkrimson' was genotyped with the array to assess its effectiveness. A large majority of SNPs (166\u00a0335 or 83%) are of high quality. The high density and uniform distribution of the array SNPs facilitated prediction of centromeric regions on 17 pear chromosomes, and significantly improved the genome assembly from 75.5% to 81.4% based on genetic mapping. Identification of a gene associated with flowering time and candidate genes linked to size of fruit core via genome wide association studies showed the usefulness of the array in pear genetic research. The newly developed high-density SNP array presents an important tool for rapid and high-throughput genotyping in pear for genetic map construction, QTL identification and genomic selection."}

The purpose of this randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of daily fresh pear consumption on blood pressure (primary outcome) and other biomarkers of cardiometabolic health in middle-aged/older adults with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Forty men and women aged 45-65 years with MetS were included and randomly assigned to receive either two medium-sized fresh pears (Pear) or a calorie-matched control drink (Control) per day for each 12-week treatment period, each separated by a 4-week washout period. After 12 weeks of daily fresh pear consumption, systolic blood pressure tended to be reduced (130 \u00b1 2 mmHg vs. 134 \u00b1 2 mmHg at baseline, P = 0.07) and pulse pressure was significantly reduced (51 \u00b1 1 vs. 54 \u00b1 1 at baseline, P < 0.05). At 12 weeks, leptin concentrations were lower in the Pear group than Control (52.5 [7.6, 120.5] ng dL-1vs. 53.4 [5.0, 120.5] ng dL-1, respectively, P < 0.05), and there was a significant group by time interaction (P < 0.05). Leptin concentrations were significantly reduced at 12 weeks compared to baseline in the Pear group (52.5 [7.6, 120.5] ng dL-1vs. 54.8 [6.4, 120.5] ng dL-1 at baseline, P < 0.05) but not in the Control group. Waist circumference was significantly reduced at 12 weeks in the Pear group (107.7 \u00b1 2.0 cm vs. 108.4 \u00b1 2 cm at baseline, P < 0.05) with a trend for a group by time interaction (P < 0.1), and significantly lower in the Pear group than Control (108.1 \u00b1 2.0 cm vs. 108.8 \u00b1 2 cm, P < 0.05) at 6 weeks with a significant group by time interaction (P < 0.05). Conversely, values were significantly increased at 6 weeks (108.8 \u00b1 2 cm vs. 108.3 \u00b1 2.0 cm at baseline, P < 0.05) in the Control group and sustained at 12 weeks. Waist-to-hip ratio was significantly reduced (0.92 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 0.93 \u00b1 0.01 at baseline, P < 0.05) at 12 weeks in the Pear group, and significantly lower than Control at 6 weeks (0.93 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 0.93 \u00b1 0.01, respectively, P < 0.05) and 12 weeks (0.92 \u00b1 0.01 vs. 0.93 \u00b1 0.01, P < 0.05). These findings suggest that daily fresh pear consumption may promote modest improvements in cardiometabolic health in middle-aged/older adults with MetS.

{"keyword": "Pear", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are dispersions synthesized by replacing liquid lipid in an o/w emulsion with solid lipids. Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) improve on some of the major limitations of the SLNs as NLCs use liquid lipids along with crystalline solid fatty acids to build the core. AIMS:This work aims to investigate the potential advantage of using Prickly Pear (PP) seed oil to develop NLCs for topical delivery of vitamin A. METHODS:Four PP-based NLC formulations with varying composition have been developed using the hot homogenization method and compared with a SLN formulation that is free of PP oil. The effect of this variation on entrapment efficiency, in vitro release behavior, and ex vivo permeation, was investigated. Additionally, particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) upon storage, zeta potential, and thermal behavior were characterized. RESULTS:PP-based NLCs exhibited smaller particle size in the range of 215-244\u00a0nm, and PDI <0.3. In contrast, SLN having no PP oil had a larger diameter of 365\u00a0nm, with heterogeneous distribution (0.92 PDI). In assessing the in vitro release, an inverse relationship was observed between the diffusion flux and the entrapment efficiency. The changes in the constituting matrix of the NLCs lead to a significant potential variation in their properties, and hence allowing it to be tailored for specific usages. CONCLUSIONS:In all cases, NLCs formulations have shown superior attributes to the SLN carriers. This was linked in most cases to the presence of PP oil, supporting the value of utilizing PP oil in cosmeceutical applications."}

In this study, DNA sequence analyses of the 16S rDNA and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) DNA regions were performed to identify pear psyllids from 28 regions of 20 provinces in China and to classify their genetic relationships to understand the origin of the species. The results showed that Cacopsylla chinensis Yang et Li (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) was found in most pear orchards in China, but Cacopsylla qianli (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) was found in only the cities of Guiyang (Guizhou province) and Xiangyang (Hubei province). The results for the 16S rDNA and COI regions were similar. Based on the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analyses of 16S rDNA and COI, C. chinensis could be divided into three groups: lineages I, II, and III. Based on 16S rDNA and COI, lineage II showed approximately 4% and 3% difference from lineage I, and lineage III showed approximately 12% and 9% difference from lineage I, respectively. C. chinensis lineage I was found in most provinces of China, while C. chinensis lineage II samples were mainly found in the Bohai rim region of China, and lineage III samples were found in Northeast China. The results of this study will provide information to pear producers regarding effective control measures to prevent further damage from pear psyllids."}

Although the genome of Chinese white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) has recently been made available, knowledge regarding the BAM family in pear, including gene function, evolutionary history and patterns of gene expression remains limited. In this study, we identified 17 PbBAMs in the pear genome. Of these, 12 PbBAM members were mapped onto 9 chromosomes and 5 PbBAM genes were located on scaffold contigs. Based on gene structure, protein motif analysis, and the topology of the phylogenetic tree of the PbBAM family, we classified member genes into 4 groups. All PbBAM genes were found to contain typical glycosyl hydrolysis 14 domain motifs. Interfamilial comparisons revealed that the phylogenetic relationships of BAM genes in other Rosaceae species were similar those found in pear. We also found that whole-genome duplication (WGD)/segmental duplication events played critical roles in the expansion of the BAM family. Next, we used transcriptomic data to study gene expression during the response of drought and low temperate responses, and found that genes in Group B were related to drought and cold stress. We identified four PbBAM genes associated with abiotic stress in Pear. Finally, by analyzing co-expression networks and co-regulatory genes, we found that PbBAM1a and PbBAM1b were associated with the pear abiotic stress response."}

Mortality of adult pear psylla was determined after its exposure to horticultural oil (HO) combined with high temperature (thermotherapy) treatments. A laboratory\u2013scale application technology unit was developed to apply HO\u2013based thermotherapy. Spray treatments included four variables namely heat\u2013condition (i.e., heat and no\u2013heat), HO concentration (i.e., 0.5 and 1.0%), nozzle types (i.e., N1: Conejet nozzle, N2: D2/DC13 disc\u2013core nozzle) and application pressure (i.e., 344.7 [50] and 689.5 [100] kPa [psi]). Each treatment was replicated four times on pear psylla bioassays. Mortality was evaluated at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after spray application. HO combined with thermotherapy achieved as high as 100% pear psylla mortality during early hours after spray application. The overall mean pear psylla mortality using HO under heat condition (63.7 \u00b1 2.4% [mean \u00b1 std. error]) was significantly higher compared to no\u2013heat condition (43.6 \u00b1 1.8%). Higher HO concentration (i.e., 1.0%) under heat condition had significantly higher mortality (60.2 \u00b1 2.3%) compared to similar applications at lower concentration (47.1 \u00b1 2.0%). Pear psylla mortality was significantly affected by nozzle type under heat conditions, and nozzle N1 (with comparatively higher spray coverage on water sensitive papers) had significantly higher (74.4 \u00b1 3.1%) pear psylla mortality compared to nozzle N2 (52.9 \u00b1 3.3%). The interaction between thermotherapy and each of the HO concentrations and nozzles on psylla mortality was significant at \u03b1 = 0.05. Overall, HO combined with thermotherapy caused a rapid kill of pear psylla. Future field studies are warranted to evaluate efficacy of HO\u2013based thermotherapy at reduced HO concentrations and pertinent effects on smothering of eggs and pear psylla mortality."}

To better understand the molecular mechanism in pear responsible for the regulation of nitrate transport and assimilation, RNA-seq was performed on samples collected in response to nitrate treatments. Here, 10,273 differentially expressed genes were obtained and annotated into 49 GO terms, 45 clusters having co-expression trends that involved 18 KEGG-defined significantly overrepresented pathways. The KEGG pathways revealed that 15 unigenes, including one NRT gene, two NR genes, one NiR gene, two GDH genes, six GS genes and three GOGAT genes, were related to nitrogen metabolism and significantly differentially expressed in response to nitrate starvation and a nitrate re-supply treatment. Furthermore, 449 transcription factors belonging to 35 different families were identified during the nitrate treatments. The expression patterns of 14 randomly selected differentially expressed genes were validated by qRT-PCR. This study provides valuable resources for investigating the genetics of the nitrogen metabolic pathways and improving nitrogen utilization efficiency in pear."}

Honeybee (Apis mellifera) is considered the most important pollinator of pear. Nevertheless, limited pollen transfer has been cited as the main cause of poor fruit set in many pear orchards. Here, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) colony manipulations increase the pollen collection tendency of honeybees and (ii) the proportion of pollen loads being returned to the hive is from the target plant. The technique reliably and rapidly estimates the pollination of honeybees tested under different colony manipulations: (1) using pollen trapping (PT); (2) PT with sugar syrup feeding (SS) (PTSS); (3) SS alone and (4) control without PT and SS. The results clearly show that the pollen collection of honeybees during the experiment was significantly affected (P < 0.05) by colony manipulations. The mean amount of pollen harvested daily was higher for PTSS (19.4 g) and PT (16.4 g) than for SS (12.85 g) and control (8.7 g) colonies. Therefore, PTSS was the most effective treatment for increasing pear pollen collection; other treatments such as PT and SS could also be useful. This study was important for determining how the behavior of honeybee colonies is shaped through colony manipulation to enhance pollen collection of less preferred pear flowers, which is critical when pollination is required."}

In the past decade, significant progress has been made in pear molecular genetics based on DNA research, but the number of molecular markers is still quite limited, which hardly satisfies the increasing needs of geneticists and breeders. RESULTS:In this study, a total of 156,396 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were identified from a genome sequence of Pyrus bretschneideri 'Dangshansuli'. A total of 101,694 pairs of SSR primers were designed from the SSR loci, and 80,415 of the SSR loci were successfully located on 17 linkage groups (LGs). A total of 534 primer pairs were synthesized and preliminarily screened in four pear cultivars, and of these, 332 primer pairs were selected as clear, stable, and polymorphic SSR markers. Eighteen polymorphic SSR markers were randomly selected from the 332 polymorphic SSR markers in order to perform a further analysis of the genetic diversity among 44 pear cultivars. The 14 European pears and their hybrid materials were clustered into one group (European pear group); 29 Asian pear cultivars were clustered into one group (Asian pear group); and the Zangli pear cultivar 'Deqinli' from Yunnan Province, China, was grouped in an independent group, which suggested that the cultivar 'Deqinli' is a distinct and valuable germplasm resource. The population structure analysis partitioned the 44 cultivars into two populations, Pop 1 and Pop 2. Pop 2 was further divided into two subpopulations. Results from the population structure analysis were generally consistent with the results from the UPGMA cluster analysis. CONCLUSIONS:The results of the present study showed that the use of next-generating sequencing to develop SSR markers is fast and effective, and the developed SSR markers can be utilized by researchers and breeders for future pear improvement."}

MANOVA was used to examine associations between sensory variety (independent variable) and six dependent measures. We tested for interactions between sensory variety condition and individual-level factors that may influence food intake. There was no main effect of sensory variety condition for any dependent measure. However, interactions between sensory variety condition and age, overweight status, and prime were detected. Adults with overweight (vs. adults of normal weight) ate more pear with color variety (7.2 vs. 4.4 oz, p = 0.01). Pear intake was also higher among adults with overweight in the color variety (7.2 oz) vs. combination variety (4.4 oz) condition. Adults \u226536y/o ate more peppers (3.5 oz) in the color variety condition versus other conditions (2.1\u20132.2 oz, p = 0.04).

However, little is known about the evolutionary history of these pear species and what has contributed to the distinct phenotypic traits between Asian pears and European pears. RESULTS:We report the genome resequencing of 113 pear accessions from worldwide collections, representing both cultivated and wild pear species. Based on 18,302,883 identified SNPs, we conduct phylogenetics, population structure, gene flow, and selective sweep analyses. Furthermore, we propose a model for the divergence, dissemination, and independent domestication of Asian and European pears in which pear, after originating in southwest China and then being disseminated throughout central Asia, has eventually spread to western Asia, and then on to Europe. We find evidence for rapid evolution and balancing selection for S-RNase genes that have contributed to the maintenance of self-incompatibility, thus promoting outcrossing and accounting for pear genome diversity across the Eurasian continent. In addition, separate selective sweep signatures between Asian pears and European pears, combined with co-localized QTLs and differentially expressed genes, underline distinct phenotypic fruit traits, including flesh texture, sugar, acidity, aroma, and stone cells.

The previous research reported that the fruit size of pear was mainly caused by the number of cell in about 40 days after blossom (DAB) in nature. However, studies about the mechanisms underlying cell division in young fruit development are very limited in pear. Two pear accessions codenamed 'GH59B' with big fruit and 'GH81S' with small fruit in three stages were sampled and the RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate changes of gene transcription levels in the early stage of fruit development. The difference of cell size among two samples was little in 40 DAB, implying that the difference of the fruit size was caused by the number of the cell. More than 274,517,982 high quality reads from six libraries of fruit development were sequenced. A total of 797 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Three cytokinin dehydrogenase genes and two gibberellin 2-beta-dioxygenase gene were identified in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways related to zeatin and gibberellin. Their expression was upregulated at 20 DAB in 'GH81S' and at 30 DAB in 'GH59B', suggesting that the small fruit size might be related to the early degradation of cytokinin and gibberellin inducing a short period of cell division. A total of 38 DEGs of transcription factors were found and 23 DEGs including NAC, ERF and bHLH transcription factors were highly related with cytokinin dehydrogenase and gibberellin dioxygenase genes. Altogether, the results of the present study provide information from a comprehensive gene expression analysis and insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the difference of fruit size in Pyrus pyrifolia."}

Leaf surface wettability is dependent on the property of the liquid as well as the physical and chemical properties of the leaf, which vary with climate and growth stage. The aim of this study was to characterize the wettability of pear leaves from three different climatic regions at different stages after flowering. RESULTS:The contact angles of different test liquids were measured on both adaxial and abaxial pear leaf surfaces and the Owens-Wendt-Rabel-Kaelble (OWRK) method was used to calculate surface free energy (SFE) and its polar and non-polar components. The results demonstrated that the SFE of both the adaxial and abaxial surface of the pear leaf, and the proportion of polar component, increased with increasing time after flowering. At early growth stages, pear leaves were highly hydrophobic, similar to a polytetrafluoroethylene surface, whereas at later growth stages, pear leaves were hydrophobic, more similar to a polymethylmethacrylate surface. Also, the SFE differed with climatic region. Factors influencing these changes are discussed. CONCLUSION:Changes in contact angles and SFE correlated with the change of the leaf surface wettability. Leaves became easier to wet (higher SFE), with an overall increasing polar component to the surface, with increasing age after flowering. As expected, changes in wettability were found in pear leaves at different stages after flowering and in different regions (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Pear leaves from Yuanping were easier to wet than leaves from Yuci and Linyi, and adaxial surfaces were easier to wet than abaxial surfaces. These results provide beneficial information for the application of agrochemicals for improved wetting and spreading behavior. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}

We further revealed that gene expression levels of some HD-Zip members were closely related to ABA concentrations in flower buds during dormancy transition. Exogenous ABA treatment confirmed that PpHB22 and several other HD-Zip genes responded to ABA. Yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase assay results combining subcellular localization showed that PpHB22 was present in nucleus and directly induced PpDAM1 (dormancy associated MADS-box 1) expression. Thus, PpHB22 is a negative regulator of plant growth associated with the ABA response pathway and functions upstream of PpDAM1.

{"keyword": "Lithium Carbonate", "texts": "The definite aim of the present paper is to present some novel methods that use oxygen-free roasting and wet magnetic separation to in situ recycle of cobalt, Lithium Carbonate and Graphite from mixed electrode materials. The in situ recycling means to change waste into resources by its own components, which is an idea of \"waste+waste\u2192resources.\" After mechanical scraping the mixed electrode materials enrich powders of LiCoO2 and graphite. The possible reaction between LiCoO2 and graphite was obtained by thermodynamic analysis. The feasibility of the reaction at high temperature was studied with the simultaneous thermogravimetry analysis under standard atmospheric pressure. Then the oxygen-free roasting/wet magnetic separation method was used to transfer the low added value mixed electrode materials to high added value products. The results indicated that, through the serious technologies of oxygen-free roasting and wet magnetic separation, mixture materials consist with LiCoO2 and graphite powders are transferred to the individual products of cobalt, Lithium Carbonate and Graphite. Because there is not any chemical solution added in the process, the cost of treating secondary pollution can be saved. This study provides a theoretical basis for industrial-scale recycling resources from spent LIBs."}

Carbomers used in the concentration of 10%-30% for preparation of matrix tablets, may significantly affect the profile of drug release due to the formation of hydrogel matrix tablets. The aim of this study was to compare the influence of different types of Carbopol (carbomers in the pharmacopoeia) on the release rate of lithium-carbonate and other pharmaceutical, technological, physical and chemical properties of the prepared formulations of matrix tablets.Three different formulations of matrix tablets were made according to direct compression method. The tablets were of the following composition: carbomer, lactose monohydrate, magnesium-stearate, lithium-carbonate in the proportion 75:120: 5 : 300. The first formulation was made with Carbopol 971P NF, the second one with Carbopol 974 P NF and the third one with Carbopol 71G NF. The quantity of lithium-carbonate was determined according to the BP 2009, pharmaceutical and tecnological properties were examined in accordance with the regulations of Ph. Jug.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Despite the clear success of office-based buprenorphine treatment in increasing availability of effective treatment for opioid use disorder, constraints on its effectiveness include high attrition and limited high-quality behavioral care in many areas. Web-based interventions may be a novel strategy for providing evidence-based behavioral care to individuals receiving office-based buprenorphine maintenance. This report describes modification and initial pilot testing of Web-based training in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT4CBT) specifically for use with individuals in office-based buprenorphine. METHODS:Twelve-week randomized pilot trial evaluating effects of CBT4CBT-Buprenophine in retaining participants and reducing drug use with respect to standard office-based buprenorphine alone was carried out. Twenty individuals meeting DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition) criteria for current opioid use disorder were randomized to standard buprenorphine treatment or buprenorphine plus access to CBT4CBT-Buprenorphine. RESULTS:There were promising findings regarding rates of urine toxicology screens negative for opioids (91% versus 64%; P\u2009=\u2009.05, effect size d\u2009=\u20090.88) and all drugs (82% versus 30%; P\u2009=\u2009.004, d\u2009=\u20091.2). Individuals randomized to CBT4CBT-Buprenorphine completed a mean of 82.6 (SD\u2009=\u20094.4) days of treatment (of a possible 84) compared with 68.6 (SD\u2009=\u200932.6) for those assigned to standard buprenorphine treatment. CONCLUSIONS:Although preliminary and limited by the small sample size, this trial suggests the feasibility and promise of validated, Web-based interventions, tailored for this specific patient population, for improving outcomes in office-based buprenorphine."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Buprenorphine can be effective in a variety of community substance use treatment settings outside of methadone programs, including outpatient programs and medical practices. In these settings, it has been found to be effective in reducing opioid use and retaining patients in treatment. Despite its effectiveness and safety, it is rarely provided to individuals with opioid use disorders in probation and parole settings. METHODS:Male and female individuals under probation or parole supervision (N\u202f=\u202f320) with histories of opioid use disorder will be enrolled in this randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms: Buprenorphine Bridge Treatment (BBT): Participants will begin buprenorphine using the MedicaSafe dispensing device immediately after an on-site intake at a community supervision office and continue such treatment until they are transitioned to a community program; or Treatment as Usual (TAU): Participants will receive a referral to buprenorphine pharmacotherapy treatment in the community. Treatment outcomes will be: (a) illicit opioid oral saliva drug test results; and (b) treatment adherence (i. entered community based treatment; ii. number of days receiving opioid treatment). RESULTS:We describe the background and rationale for the study, its aims, hypotheses, and study design. CONCLUSIONS:If shown to increase compliance rates with conditions of probation and parole, buprenorphine treatment co-located at community supervision field offices could have a major impact on delivery of buprenorphine treatment to the criminal justice population. The public health impact of the proposed study would be widespread because this intervention could be implemented throughout areas of the US."}

Qualitative interviews, conducted in 2012/2013 and repeated in 2015, identified systemic barriers to providing buprenorphine treatment in Ohio. A representative sample of Ohio's Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) county boards (n =\u00a018) was selected based on percentage of OUD admissions, density of buprenorphine prescribers, and county board area population. Boards reported that the barriers to the use of buprenorphine in 2012/2013 included (1) negative attitudes toward the use of buprenorphine among substance use disorder treatment providers; (2) a lack of prescribers; and (3) lack of funding. The 2015 interviews suggested that the lack of prescribers surpassed lack of funding as the main impediment to buprenorphine expansion. Negative provider attitudes were no longer problematic. Concerns about buprenorphine diversion, however, had emerged as a new barrier. This article offers recommendations for future policy efforts to overcome these barriers and expand the use of evidence-based opioid treatments. It highlights the need for payers and policymakers to increase the number of buprenorphine prescribers to make best use of funding available to fight the opioid epidemic."}

In Iran, tramadol abuse arises most commonly as a result of self-medicating that leads to tramadol dependence. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of mu opioid receptors approved for the treatment of tramadol dependence, is administered sublingually due to its extensive first-pass metabolism and resulting low oral bioavailability. A 50-year-old man presenting with tramadol dependence after self-medicating for chronic low back pain experienced adverse reactions to a minimal dosage (0.8 mg) of sublingual buprenorphine. He was treated successfully with a modified protocol composed of swallowing sublingual tablets (0.2 mg/day initially, which increased to 0.2 mg every 12 hours during maintenance therapy). This unusual case suggests that swallowing buprenorphine sublingual tablets may prevent adverse effects and reduce the rate of treatment dropout."}

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Buprenorphine is a commonly used opioid in pain therapy as well as in opiate maintenance therapy. Immunoassays are quick and cost-effective methods for the necessary toxicological urine analysis of maintenance therapy patients. In this study a novel enzymatic immunoassay, the Thermo Fisher Scientific CEDIA Buprenorphine II assay (Bup2) was evaluated for the detection of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine and their conjugated metabolites in human urine samples. The Bup2 assay has a cut-off of 10 ng/mL with \u00b125% controls, whereas the existing CEDIA Buprenorphine assay (Bup1) has a cut-off of 5 ng/mL and \u00b140% controls. Both assays were analyzed on a Thermo Scientific Indiko Plus benchtop analyzer. Seven-day precision studies of Bup2 assay demonstrated excellent precision of 7.2-10.6%. No crossover between control samples and the cut-off level were observed. Urine samples of 120 patients undergoing opiate maintenance therapy were collected. Immunoassay results of Bup1 and Bup2 were confirmed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine as well as for their glucuronides. Comparison showed a specificity of 0.99 between the Bup2 assay and GC/MS, whereas the Bup1 assay had a specificity 0.70 due to 21 false positive samples. The reason is a known cross-reactivity of the Bup1 assay to opiate compounds. The Bup2 assay revealed one false positive result close to the cut-off value; no specific candidate possibly causing a cross-reaction was detected by GC/MS and liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods. The data presented demonstrate an excellent correlation of the Bup2 assay to GC/MS, showing improved specificity and sensitivity when compared to the Bup1 assay. Thus, the Bup2 assay is highly suitable for urine testing, even for opiate maintenance patients receiving high doses of morphine."}

To understand the neural impact of buprenorphine in depression, we examined acute limbic and reward circuit changes during an intervention with low-dose buprenorphine augmentation pharmacotherapy. Mid and late-life adults with major depression (N\u202f=\u202f31) who did not completely respond to an adequate trial of venlafaxine were randomized to augmentation with low-dose buprenorphine or matching placebo. We investigated early neural changes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from pre-randomization to 3\u202fweeks using both an emotional reactivity task and a gambling task. We tested if: 1) there were significant neural changes acutely per intervention group, and 2) if acute neural changes were associated with depressive symptom change over 8\u202fweeks using both the total score and the dysphoria subscale of the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Participants in both the buprenorphine and placebo groups showed similar changes in depressive symptoms. Neither the emotional reactivity nor gambling task resulted in significant neural activation changes from pre-randomization to 3-weeks. In both groups, increases in rostral anterior cingulate (rACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activation during the emotional reactivity task were associated with overall symptom improvement. In the buprenorphine but not the placebo group, increased activation in left anterior insula (aINS) and bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) was associated with improvement on the dysphoria subscale. Activation changes in the reward task were not associated with buprenorphine. This is the first study to show an association between acute neural changes during emotion reactivity and changes in depression severity with buprenorphine treatment."}

Very high doses of morphine are ineffective in overcoming opioid-induced hyperalgesia and providing antinociception to methadone-maintained patients in an experimental setting. Whether the same occurs in buprenorphine-maintained subjects is unknown. Design:Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled. Subjects were tested on two occasions, at least five days apart, once with intravenous morphine and once with intravenous saline. Subjects were tested at about the time of putative trough plasma buprenorphine concentrations. Setting:Ambulatory. Subjects:Twelve buprenorphine-maintained subjects: once daily sublingual dose (range = 2-22\u2009mg); no dose change for 1.5-12\u2009months. Ten healthy controls. Methods:Intravenous morphine bolus and infusions administered over two hours to achieve two separate pseudo-steady-state plasma concentrations one hour apart. Pain tolerance was assessed by application of nociceptive stimuli (cold pressor [seconds] and electrical stimulation [volts]). Ten blood samples were collected for assay of plasma morphine, buprenorphine, and norbuprenorphine concentrations until three hours after the end of the last infusion; pain tolerance and respiration rate were measured to coincide with blood sampling times.

Buprenorphine was chosen as the model substrate as it is extensively metabolized by CYPs to norbuprenorphine and by UGTs to buprenorphine glucuronide. Chrysin, ginger extract, \u03b1-mangostin, pterostilbene and silybin were tested for their inhibition of the formation of norbuprenorphine or buprenorphine glucuronide in both intestinal and liver microsomes. Pterostilbene was the most potent inhibitor of norbuprenorphine formation in both intestinal and liver microsomes, with IC50 values of 1.3 and 0.8\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, while \u03b1-mangostin and silybin most potently inhibited buprenorphine glucuronide formation. The equipotent combination of pterostilbene and ginger extract additively inhibited both pathways in intestinal microsomes. Since pterostilbene and ginger extract showed potent CYP and/or UGT inhibition of buprenorphine metabolism, their equipotent combination was tested to assess the presence of synergistic inhibition. However, because the combination showed additive inhibition, it was not used while performing IVIVE analysis. Based on quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolation, pterostilbene (21\u00a0mg oral dose) appeared to be most effective in improving the mean predicted Foral and AUC\u221e PO of buprenorphine from 3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% and 340\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0330\u00a0ng*min/ml to 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08% and 36,000\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025,000\u00a0ng*min/ml, respectively. At a 10-fold lower dose of pterostilbene, the predicted buprenorphine Foral approximated sublingual bioavailability (~35%) and showed a 2-4 fold reduction in the variability around the predicted AUC\u221e PO of buprenorphine. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using various GRAS/dietary compounds to inhibit substantially the metabolism by CYP and UGT enzymes to achieve higher and less variable oral bioavailability. This inhibitor strategy may be useful for drugs suffering from low and variable oral bioavailability due to extensive presystemic oxidative and/or conjugative metabolism."}

Methods:The study was of open label, two-way randomized crossover design in 14 fasted healthy male and female volunteers. Each participant, under naltrexone block, received either a single intravenous dose of 300 mcg of buprenorphine as a constant infusion over five minutes or a sublingual dose of 800 mcg of buprenorphine in two treatment periods separated by a seven-day washout period. Blood sampling for plasma drug assay was taken on 16 occasions throughout a 48-hour period (predose and at 10, 20, 30, and 45 minutes, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 48\u2009hours postdose). The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental analyses of the buprenorphine plasma concentration-time profiles. Local tolerability was assessed using modified Likert scales. Results:The absolute bioavailability of SL buprenorphine was 45.4% (95% confidence interval = 37.8-54.3%). The median times to peak plasma concentration were 10\u2009minutes and 60\u2009minutes after IV and SL administration, respectively. The peak plasma concentration was 2.65\u2009ng/mL and 0.74\u2009ng/mL after IV and SL administration, respectively. The half-lives were 9.1\u2009hours and 11.2\u2009hours after IV and SL administration, respectively. The wafer had very good local tolerability. Conclusions:This novel sublingual buprenorphine wafer has high bioavailability and reduced Tmax compared with other SL tablet formulations of buprenorphine. The wafer displayed very good local tolerability. The results suggest that this novel buprenorphine wafer may provide enhanced clinical utility in the management of both acute and chronic pain. Background:Buprenorphine is approved for use in pain management and opioid addiction. Sublingual administration of buprenorphine is a simple and noninvasive route of administration and has been available for many years.

The downside, as with all opioids, natural or synthetic, is its potential for misuse and abuse. The euphoria induced by buprenorphine leads to abuse. Additionally, individuals with an active addiction to short-acting opioids such as heroin may use buprenorphine between doses of their drug of choice to stave off withdrawal symptoms. As such, buprenorphine monitoring is utilized in medication-assisted therapy programs for opioid dependency, as well as chronic pain management settings.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:The core pharmacological treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), although remission is only around 30% with them. Many patients will self-treat with opioids and due to the opiate system involvement in dysphoric mood and anxiety/stress responses, it is likely that antagonism of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system represents a potential target for treatment of PTSD. The aim of this study is to compare response of PTSD symptoms when antagonizing KOR via buprenorphine/naloxone compared to SSRIs or opioid therapy. METHODS:A retrospective chart review of patients in the MEDVAMC between June 1, 2010 and June 30, 2016 was conducted. Inclusion criteria included patients with a documented diagnosis of PTSD with at least two documented PTSD scores (either PCLC or PC-PTSD). Exclusion criteria included patients not prescribed one of the study medications (ie, buprenorphine, SSRI, or opiate for chronic pain), and patients not on the study medication for at least 30 days. RESULTS:Buprenorphine patients exhibited the lowest final average PTSD score (2.47) and the largest change from baseline (-24.0%) compared to opioids (-16.1%) or SSRIs (1.16%). The average buprenorphine dose was 23.3\u2009mg/day, and the average length of therapy was 860 days. CONCLUSIONS:Buprenorphine may help decrease PTSD symptoms more than SSRIs or opioids alone. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether these effects are reproducible. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE:Pharmacotherapy advancements in PTSD treatment have been limited and the kappa opioid receptor system presents a new target that warrants further research.

The seven strategies include: community education, provider education, hospital emergency department policy change, diversion control, support programs for patients with pain, naloxone policies, and addiction treatment expansion. PL was originally developed in Wilkes County, NC. It was made available to all counties in North Carolina starting in March 2013 with funding of up to $34,400 per county per year. We examined the\u00a0association between PL implementation and 1) overall dispensing rate of opioid analgesics, and 2) utilization of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is often used in connection with medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid dependence. METHODS:Observational interrupted time series analysis of 100 counties over 2009-2014 (n\u2009=\u20097200 county-months) in North Carolina. The intervention period was March 2013-December 2014. 74 of 100 counties implemented the intervention. Exposure data sources comprised process surveys, training records, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) data, and methadone treatment program quality data. Outcomes were PDMP-derived counts of opioid prescriptions and buprenorphine patients. Incidence Rate Ratios were estimated with adjusted GEE Poisson regression models of all seven PL strategies. RESULTS:In adjusted models, diversion control efforts were positively associated with increased dispensing of opioid analgesics (IRR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.09). None of the other PL strategies were associated with reduced prescribing of opioid analgesics. Support programs for patients with pain were associated with a non-significant decrease in buprenorphine utilization (IRR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.02), but addiction treatment expansion efforts were associated with no change in buprenorphine utilization (IRR: 0.98; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.06). CONCLUSIONS:Implementation of PL strategies did not appreciably reduce opioid dispensing and did not increase buprenorphine utilization. These results are consistent with previous findings of limited impact of PL strategies on overdose morbidity and mortality. Future studies should analyze the uptake of MAT using a more expansive view of institutional barriers, treating community coalition activity around MAT as an effect modifier."}

OBJECTIVE:The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of a single, high dose of buprenorphine on craving in opioid-dependent patients over 5\u2009days of abstinence from use of other opioids. The primary goal was to determine the safety and efficacy of buprenorphine during withdrawal in a hospital setting. METHODS:Ninety men who used opium, heroin, or prescribed opioids and met DSM-5 criteria for opioid use disorder (severe form) were randomized to three groups (n\u2009=\u200930 per group) to receive a single, sublingual dose of buprenorphine (32, 64, or 96\u2009mg). The study was conducted in an inpatient psychiatric ward, with appropriate precautions and monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular measures. Buprenorphine was administered when the patients were in moderate opiate withdrawal, as indicated by the presence of four to five symptoms. A structured clinical interview was conducted, and urine toxicology testing was performed at baseline. Self-reports of craving were obtained at baseline and on each of the 5\u2009days after buprenorphine administration. FINDINGS:Craving decreased from baseline in each of the three groups (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), with a significant interaction between group and time (p\u2009<\u20090.038), indicating that groups with higher doses of buprenorphine had greater reduction. CONCLUSIONS:A single, high dose of buprenorphine can reduce craving during opioid withdrawal; additional studies with follow-up are warranted to evaluate safety."}

A rapid method for the simultaneous analysis of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, and glucuronides in urine using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed. Urine samples were diluted in water containing formic acid 0.1% and directly injected into the UHPLC-MS/MS system without any sample pretreatment. Quality control (QC) samples, prepared using 20 different urine matrices, fortified at 3 concentration levels, were quantified using four deuterated internal standards. The accuracy values obtained spanned from 90 to 114% with repeatability lower than 10% also in the inter-day between batch experiments. Matrix effects (ME), evaluated before correction with internal standards using Matuszewski procedure, mainly affected the analysis of buprenorphine glucuronide. The use of deuterated internal standards (IS) for each analyte was necessary to compensate for ME and was essential in the determination of glucuronides. The method was applied to 30 real urine samples from patients under a detoxification therapy. Duplicate analyses were performed with the presented method and compared with another method which involves a standard hydrolysis procedure. Real sample results were compared showing a good performance agreement, with differences between the two methods lower than \u00b120% in the quantification results."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) has been available in a standard regime in the Czech Republic since 2000. Buprenorphine is the leading medication, while methadone is available only in a few specialised centres. There is an important leakage of buprenorphine onto the illicit market, and the majority of Czech opioid users are characterised by the misuse (and injecting) of diverted buprenorphine medications. Most prescribed buprenorphine for OAT is not covered by current national health insurance schemes, and patients have to pay considerable prices to afford their treatment. This affordability barrier together with limited accessibility is likely the leading factor of limited coverage of OAT and of recent stagnation in the number of patients in the official treatment programmes in the Czech Republic. It also encourages doctor shopping and the re-selling of parts of their medication at a higher price, which represents the main factor that drives the Czech illicit market for buprenorphine, but at the same time co-finances the medication of clients in official OAT programmes. Improving access to OAT by making it financially affordable is essential to further increase OAT coverage and is one of the factors that can reduce the illicit market with OAT medications."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate thermal antinociceptive effects and pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine hydrochloride after IM administration to cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus). ANIMALS 16 adult (\u2265 2 years old) cockatiels (8 males and 8 females). PROCEDURES Buprenorphine hydrochloride (0.3 mg/mL) at each of 3 doses (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg/kg) and saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (control treatment) were administered IM to birds in a randomized within-subject complete crossover study. Foot withdrawal response to a thermal stimulus was determined before (baseline) and 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 6 hours after treatment administration. Agitation-sedation scores were also determined. For the pharmacokinetic analysis, buprenorphine (0.6 mg/kg) was administered IM to 12 of the birds, and blood samples were collected at 9 time points ranging from 5 minutes to 9 hours after drug administration. Samples were analyzed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated with commercial software. RESULTS Buprenorphine at 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 mg/kg did not significantly change the thermal foot withdrawal response, compared with the response for the control treatment. No significant change in agitation-sedation scores was detected between all doses of buprenorphine and the control treatment. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations were > 1 ng/mL in all 4 birds evaluated at 9 hours. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Buprenorphine at the doses evaluated did not significantly change the thermal nociceptive threshold for cockatiels or cause sedative or agitative effects. Additional studies with other pain assessments and drug doses are needed to evaluate the analgesic and adverse effects of buprenorphine in cockatiels and other avian species."}

Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for heroin and prescription opioid use disorder; however, little is known about treatment outcomes among people using fentanyl. We compared 6-month treatment retention and opioid abstinence among people initiating buprenorphine treatment who had toxicology positive for heroin compared to fentanyl at baseline. METHODS:Retrospective cohort study of 251 adult patients initiating office-based buprenorphine treatment who had available toxicology testing across an academic health system between August 2016 and July 2017. Exposure was assessed at baseline before initiating buprenorphine and was categorized as negative toxicology (n\u200a=\u200a184) versus fentanyl positive toxicology (n\u200a=\u200a48) versus heroin positive toxicology (n\u200a=\u200a19). RESULTS:Six-month treatment retention rates were not different between the fentanyl positive and heroin positive groups [38% (n\u200a=\u200a18) vs 47% (n\u200a=\u200a9); P\u200a=\u200a0.58], or between the fentanyl positive and the negative toxicology group [38% (n\u200a=\u200a18) vs 51% (n\u200a=\u200a93); P\u200a=\u200a0.14]. Opioid abstinence at 6 months among those who had testing did not differ between the fentanyl positive and the heroin positive group [55% (n\u200a=\u200a6) vs 60% (n\u200a=\u200a6); P\u200a=\u200a0.99]. The fentanyl positive group had a lower abstinence rate at 6 months compared to those with negative toxicology at baseline [55% (n\u200a=\u200a6) vs 93% (n\u200a=\u200a63); P\u200a=\u200a0.004]. Mean initial buprenophine dosage did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS:Buprenorphine treatment retention and abstinence among those retained in treatment is not worse between people using fentanyl compared to heroin at treatment initiation. Both groups have lower abstinence rates at 6 months compared to individuals with negative toxicology at baseline. These findings suggest that people exposed to fentanyl still benefit from buprenorphine treatment."}

METHODS:In-depth semi-structured interviews with staff and former clients of the Project Connections Buprenorphine Program (PCBP) (9 people) and focus group discussions with current and previous clients of PCBP (7 people) were conducted. Content analysis was used to extract themes regarding barriers to enrolling and remaining in, and transitioning from the program. RESULTS:Primary challenges identified by the participants included struggles with cravings and symptoms of withdrawal, comorbid mental health issues, criminal justice system involvement, medication stigma, and conflicts over level of flexibility regarding program requirements and the role of employment. CONCLUSIONS:This study identified several obstacles clients face when seeking care through a combined buprenorphine-peer support model. Findings highlight potential programmatic factors that can be improved and additional resources that may support treatment retention rates and better outcomes. Despite challenges, low-threshold and community-based programs can increase access to effective maintenance treatment for OUD, especially among vulnerable populations who may not have access to formal health services."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Buprenorphine is a partial \u00b5-receptor agonist resistant to displacement from receptors by conventional opioids, which can block the effect of conventional opioids and may interfere with postoperative pain management. We aimed to quantify perioperative opioid use in patients receiving transdermal buprenorphine (TdBUP). METHODS:We identified patients receiving TdBUP who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2016. To compare opioid requirements (intravenous morphine equivalents (IV-MEq)), we constructed a matched study, matching each TdBUP patient with two opioid-naive patients by sex, age, and type of anesthesia and procedure. RESULTS:Nineteen unique patients underwent 22 procedures while receiving TdBUP. Total (IQR) amounts of IV-MEq (intraoperative, recovery room, and 24\u2009hours after recovery-room discharge) were 98 (63, 145) and 46 (30, 65) mg IV-MEq for TdBUP and opioid-naive patients, respectively (p<0.001). Postoperative IV-MEq requirements were 54 (38, 90) and 15 (3, 35) mg for TdBUP and opioid-naive patients, respectively (p<0.001). Among TdBUP patients, higher preoperative doses of TdBUP were associated with greater postoperative opioid requirements (p=0.02). Specifically, patients with a 20\u2009\u00b5g/hour TdBUP patch required 133.8\u2009mg IV-MEq more postoperatively than patients with a 5\u2009\u00b5g/hour patch (p=0.002). Following discharge from the recovery room, 17 (77%) TdBUP patients and 15 (34%) opioid-naive patients reported severe pain (OR 6.6 (95% CI 2.0 to 21.3); p<0.001; adjusting for baseline pain score, 5.0 (95% CI, 1.4 to 17.8); p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:Analgesic management for patients receiving TdBUP therapy must account for increased opioid needs, and greater preoperative doses of TdBUP were associated with greater postoperative opioid requirements."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Opioid misuse and dependence are major medical and social concerns worldwide. Buprenorphine/naloxone combination (BNC) is a drug that has misuse potential and is used to treat opioid dependence, including buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine shows its pharmacological effects by binding to opioid receptors. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist and has smaller maximal effects compared to those of full agonists (heroin, methadone). Naloxone is a non-selective opiate antagonist added to buprenorphine for the prevention of intravenous diversion. BNC is used in the treatment of opioid dependence for detoxification and maintenance. The drug should be used as a sublingual film tablet. Pregabalin is used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy and anxiety disorders. It is increasingly being reported as possessing a potential for misuse. In this article, we present a case of intravenous BNC and concomitant oral pregabalin misuse that developed in a monitored and treated patient for the reason of opioid dependence."}

There is a need to understand how and why patients use diverted buprenorphine, and whether barriers to access contribute to illicit use. METHODS:Adults >18 years with DSM-IV criteria for substance use disorder and primarily using an opioid completed the online Survey of Key Informants' Patients (SKIP) between August and September 2016. The survey included closed- and open-ended questions regarding reasons for buprenorphine use with and without a prescription, sources of buprenorphine, route of administration, and barriers to treatment. RESULTS:Of 303 respondents, 175 (58%) reported a history of diverted buprenorphine use, 65 (37%) of whom reported never receiving a prescription. The most common reasons for illicit buprenorphine use were consistent with therapeutic use: to prevent withdrawal (79%), maintain abstinence (67%), or self-wean off drugs (53%). Approximately one-half (52%) reported using buprenorphine to get high or alter mood, but few (4%) indicated that it was their drug of choice. Among respondents who had used diverted buprenorphine, 33% reported that they had issues finding a doctor or obtaining buprenorphine on their own. Most (81%) of these participants indicated they would prefer using prescribed buprenorphine, if available. CONCLUSIONS:Although 58% of survey respondents reported a history of using diverted buprenorphine, the most frequently cited reasons for non-prescription use were consistent with therapeutic use. Diversion was partially driven by barriers to access, and an unmet need for OUD treatment persists."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Opioid use disorder (OUD) is increasing in prevalence throughout the world, with approximately three million individuals in the United States affected. Buprenorphine is a medication designed, researched, and effectively used to assist in OUD recovery. OBJECTIVE:This narrative review discusses an approach to initiating buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) for opioid-abuse recovery. DISCUSSION:Buprenorphine is a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with high affinity and low intrinsic activity. Buprenorphine's long half-life, high potency, and 'ceiling effect' for both euphoric sensation and adverse effects make it an optimal treatment alternative for patients presenting to the ED with opioid withdrawal. While most commonly provided as a sublingual film or tablet, buprenorphine can also be delivered via transbuccal, transdermal, subdermal (implant), subcutaneous, and parenteral routes. Prior to ED administration, caution is recommended to avoid precipitation of buprenorphine-induced opioid withdrawal. Following the evaluation of common opioid withdrawal symptoms, a step-by-step approach to buprenorphine can by utilized to reach a sustained withdrawal relief. A multimodal medication-assisted treatment (MAT) plan involving pharmacologic treatment, as well as counseling and behavioral therapy, is essential to maintaining opioid remission. Patients may be safely discharged with safe-use counseling, close outpatient follow-up, and return precautions for continued management of their OUD. Establishing a buprenorphine program in the ED involves a multifactorial approach to establish a pro-buprenorphine culture. CONCLUSIONS:Buprenorphine is an evidence-based, safe, effective treatment option for OUD in an ED-setting. Though successfully utilized by many ED-based treatment programs, the stigma of 'replacing one opioid with another' remains a barrier. Evidence-based discussions on the safety and benefits of buprenorphine are essential to promoting a culture of acceptance and optimizing ED OUD treatment."}

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": ": Buprenorphine is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder. As a high-affinity, partial agonist for the mu-opioid receptor, buprenorphine suppresses opioid withdrawal and craving, reduces illicit opioid use, and blocks exogenous opioid effects including respiratory depression. Other pharmacologic benefits of buprenorphine are its superior safety profile compared with full opioid agonists and its long half-life that allows daily or less-than-daily dosing. New and innovative buprenorphine formulations, with pharmacokinetic profiles that differ from the original tablet formulation, continue to be developed. These include higher bioavailability transmucosal tablets and films and also 6-month implantable and monthly injectable products. This growing array of available formulations allows more choices for patients and increased opportunity for clinicians to individualize treatment; thus, it is important for buprenorphine prescribers to understand these differences."}

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Buprenorphine has been used internationally for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) since the 1990s and has been available in the United States for more than a decade. Initial practice recommendations were intentionally conservative, were based on expert opinion, and were influenced by methadone regulations. Since 2003, the American crisis of OUD has dramatically worsened, and much related empirical research has been undertaken. The findings in several important areas conflict with initial clinical practice that is still prevalent. This article reviews research findings in the following 7 areas: location of buprenorphine induction, combining buprenorphine with a benzodiazepine, relapse during buprenorphine treatment, requirements for counseling, uses of drug testing, use of other substances during buprenorphine treatment, and duration of buprenorphine treatment. For each area, evidence for needed updates and modifications in practice is provided. These modifications will facilitate more successful, evidence-based treatment and care for patients with OUD."}

The transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, BET surface area and X-ray diffraction devices were used to characterize the nanomaterials. The nanocomposite (RhNPs-MC) was casted on the glassy carbon electrode (GCE) to fabricate an electrochemical sensor (RhNPs-MC/GCE). This sensor shows high efficiency toward simultaneous determination of Morphine (Mp) and Buprenorphine (Bp), electrochemically, what other modified electrodes cannot do. For Mp, the linear range and limit of detection were obtained 0.1-20\u202f\u03bcM and 40\u202fnM, respectively, and these data were obtained about 0.1-14\u202f\u03bcM and 45\u202fnM for Bp determination.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "PURPOSE:The United States is in the midst of a severe opioid use disorder epidemic. Buprenorphine is an effective office-based treatment that can be prescribed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants with a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) waiver. However, many providers report barriers that keep them from either getting a DEA waiver or fully using it. The study team interviewed rural physicians successfully prescribing buprenorphine to identify strategies for overcoming commonly cited barriers for providing this service. METHODS:Interview candidates were randomly selected from a list of rurally located physicians with a DEA waiver to prescribe buprenorphine who reported treating high numbers of patients on a 2016 survey. Forty-three rural physicians, who were prescribing buprenorphine to a high number of patients, were interviewed about how they overcame prescribing barriers previously identified in that survey. FINDINGS:Interviewed physicians reported numerous ways to overcome common barriers to providing buprenorphine treatment in rural areas. Key recommendations included ways to (1) get started and maintain medication-assisted treatment, (2) minimize DEA intrusion and medication diversion, and (3) address the lack of mental health providers and stigma surrounding opioid use disorder (OUD). Overall, physicians found providing this service to be very rewarding. CONCLUSIONS:Despite known barriers, rural physicians around the country have been successful in adding buprenorphine treatment to their practices. Nonprescribing providers can learn from the strategies used by successful prescribers to add this service."}

This formulation has a higher bioavailability, better taste and faster sublingual dissolve time than a reference sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone tablet (Suboxone\u00ae), advantages that provide greater patient preference (potentially improving adherence) and importantly may reduce the risk of buprenorphine parenteral abuse by providing similar buprenorphine exposure at an \u2248\u00a030% lower dosage than reference buprenorphine/naloxone. In large phase III trials of up to 28\u00a0days, buprenorphine/naloxone was associated with high treatment retention rates during the induction and stabilization phases, and also reduced opioid craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms. Although noninferiority of buprenorphine/naloxone to sublingual buprenorphine tablet during the 2-day induction phase was only shown in one of the two similarly designed trials, pooled analyses confirmed that treatment retention rates were similar in the buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine groups. Where evaluated, noninferiority of buprenorphine/naloxone to sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone film (only approved in the USA) was also demonstrated at 15\u00a0days in the stabilization phase. During the 24-week extension study, buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy sustained improvements in opioid craving and addiction severity scores. Buprenorphine/naloxone was generally well tolerated, displaying a tolerability profile that was generally consistent with that seen with reference buprenorphine/naloxone. In conclusion, with potentially greater patient preference and a lower potential for parenteral buprenorphine abuse than reference buprenorphine/naloxone, buprenorphine/naloxone expands the treatment options available for adults and adolescent (aged\u2009>\u200915\u00a0years) patients with opioid dependence."}

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "OBJECTIVES:Buprenorphine/naloxone, an evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder, is sometimes diverted for non-medical use. In Rhode Island, the prevalence of opioid use and, more recently, of fentanyl in the illicit drug supply is driving overdose fatalities, which increases the need for treatment and raises questions about the changing role of diverted medication in shaping overdose risk. METHODS:This study considered data from 2 Rhode Island based studies (conducted in 2009 and 2016, respectively) of people who use illicit or diverted prescription opioids and their patterns of buprenorphine/naloxone diversion. Using targeted sampling, individuals who use opioids completed a brief questionnaire about their drug use. For the 2016 study, logistic regression was used to identify associations with recent and lifetime use of diverted medication. RESULTS:A total of 128 individuals who use opioids non-medically participated in the 2016 study. Of these, 38% (n\u200a=\u200a13) reported diverted buprenorphine/naloxone use in the past 2 months, similar to the pattern observed in 2009 (41%, n\u200a=\u200a41). Common motivations for using diverted medication included the management of withdrawal symptoms (40%, n\u200a=\u200a35) and self-treatment of opioid use disorder (39%, n\u200a=\u200a34). Few reported using to \"get high\" (12%, n\u200a=\u200a4). Seeking buprenorphine/naloxone treatment in the previous 12 months was positively associated with using diverted medication in the past 2 months (odds ratio\u200a=\u200a5.14, 95% confidence interval\u200a=\u200a1.0-26.5, P\u200a=\u200a0.05). Participants of both studies reported the same barriers to care in 2009 and 2016. CONCLUSION:The use of diverted/buprenorphine remains common among people who use opioids non-medically and indicates a severe shortage in treatment capacity and inaccessibility of existing services."}

RECENT FINDINGS:There has been few high-quality, unbiased studies performed on the use of buprenorphine in the treatment of chronic pain. Buprenorphine is an effective and safe analgesic that is tolerated at least as well, if not better, than other opioids. Given its safety and mechanistic advantages, the authors believe there is an important role for buprenorphine in the treatment of chronic pain severe enough to warrant the use of an opioid analgesic. Though data is lacking for superiority in chronic pain states, the other advantages of the molecule make it the preferential first-line opioid for around-the-clock pain in our practice."}

The Drug Addiction Treatment Act and its amendments attempted to improve access to treatment by involving office-based physicians in the provision of buprenorphine treatment. Objectives:To estimate the association of availability of buprenorphine-waivered physicians with buprenorphine treatment use and, secondarily, with prescription opioid use among Medicaid enrollees. Design, Setting, and Participants:This economic evaluation study used state-level panel data analysis to estimate the association between the number of buprenorphine-waivered physicians and the Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescribing rate and opioid prescribing rate among Medicaid fee-for-service and managed care enrollees throughout the United States between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures:Buprenorphine prescribing rate and opioid prescribing rate, measured as the number of buprenorphine prescriptions and opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid on a quarterly basis per 1000 enrollees. Results:The sample included 1059 quarterly observations. Two additional 100-patient-waivered physicians per 1\u202f000\u202f000 residents (approximately a 10% increase) were associated with an increase in the quarterly number of Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.24-0.67) per 1000 enrollees and a reduction in the quarterly number of opioid prescriptions of 1.01 (95% CI, -1.87 to -0.15) per 1000 enrollees. Furthermore, 5 additional 30-patient-waivered physicians per 1\u202f000\u202f000 residents (approximately a 10% increase) were associated with an increase in the quarterly number of Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescriptions of 0.37 (95% CI, 0.22-0.52) per 1000 enrollees and a reduction in the quarterly number of opioid prescriptions of 0.96 (95% CI, -1.85 to -0.07) per 1000 enrollees. A 10% increase in the number of buprenorphine-waivered physicians was associated with an approximately 10% increase in the Medicaid-covered buprenorphine prescribing rate and a 1.2% reduction in the opioid prescribing rate.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Background and Objective:The study was designed to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine transdermal (TD) against oral morphine in pain management of cancer patient. Methods:A randomized open-labeled prospective study was done in palliative cancer pain clinic in a tertiary care medical college between August 2017 and January 2018, to compare the efficacy (pain assessed by VAS) and adverse events (CTCAEv4) between arm A, buprenorphine TD, (20 \u03bcg/h, extended 7 days formulation) and arm B, oral morphine (10mg immediate releasing formulation). Patients with solid tumour malignancies with VAS score >40 (moderate to severe pain) were included in study. Results:63 patients were analyzed. Commonest primary cancers were breast in females and head and neck in male individuals in both arms. Initial VAS score of arm A and arm B were 81.25 and 82.26 respectively. By 1st week, 11 arm A patients were relieved from pain. Another 17 patients of arm A became pain free by 2nd week, total dose of 40 \u03bcg/h. Only 4 patients needed 60 \u03bcg/h for pain relief. In arm B, 2 patients were relieved by 1 week with total 30mg/day morphine, 11patients were relieved with 60 mg/day by 2nd week and 12 patients with 90 mg/day. 6 patients were relieved with 120 mg/day dose at the end of 4th week. Nausea and constipation were stastically higher in Arm B compared to that of Arm-A. Conclusions:TD Buprenorphine had similar efficacy with oral morphine, with better toxicity profile and better compliance."}

Objective:To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine-naloxone versus extended-release naltrexone. Design:Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a previously reported randomized clinical trial of 570 adults in 8 U.S. inpatient or residential treatment programs. Data Sources:Study instruments. Target Population:Adults with opioid use disorder. Time Horizon:24-week intervention with an additional 12 weeks of observation. Perspective:Health care sector and societal. Interventions:Buprenorphine-naloxone and extended-release naltrexone. Outcome Measures:Incremental costs combined with incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental time abstinent from opioids. Results of Base-Case Analysis:Use of the health care sector perspective and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100\u00a0000 per QALY showed buprenorphine-naloxone to be preferable to extended-release naltrexone in 97% of bootstrap replications at 24 weeks and in 85% at 36 weeks. Similar results were obtained with incremental time abstinent from opioids as an outcome and with use of the societal perspective. Results of Sensitivity Analysis:The base-case results were sensitive to the cost of the 2 treatments and the success of randomized treatment initiation. Limitation:Relatively short follow-up for a chronic condition, substantial missing data, no information on patient out-of-pocket and social service costs. Conclusion:Buprenorphine-naloxone is preferred to extended-release naltrexone as first-line treatment when both options are clinically appropriate and patients require detoxification before initiating extended-release naltrexone.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Emergency departments (EDs) frequently care for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). Buprenorphine (BUP) is an effective treatment option for patients with OUD that can safely be initiated in the ED. At present, BUP is rarely initiated as a part of routine ED care. Clinical decision support (CDS) could accelerate adoption of ED-initiated BUP into routine emergency care. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to design and formatively evaluate a user-centered decision support tool for ED initiation of BUP for patients with OUD. METHODS:User-centered design with iterative prototype development was used. Initial observations and interviews identified workflows and information needs. The design team and key stakeholders reviewed prototype designs to ensure accuracy. A total of 5 prototypes were evaluated and iteratively refined based on input from 26 attending and resident physicians. RESULTS:Early feedback identified concerns with the initial CDS design: an alert with several screens. The timing of the alert led to quick dismissal without using the tool. User feedback on subsequent iterations informed the development of a flexible tool to support clinicians with varied levels of experience with the intervention by providing both one-click options for direct activation of care pathways and user-activated support for critical decision points. The final design resolved challenging navigation issues through targeted placement, color, and design of the decision support modules and care pathways. In final testing, users expressed that the tool could be easily learned without training and was reasonable for use during routine emergency care. CONCLUSIONS:A user-centered design process helped designers to better understand users' needs for a Web-based clinical decision tool to support ED initiation of BUP for OUD. The process identified varying needs across user experience and familiarity with the protocol, leading to a flexible design supporting both direct care pathways and user-initiated decision support."}

The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of 0.04\u00a0mg/kg buprenorphine (BUP) in reducing pain in castrated piglets, using behavioral indicators and vocalization analysis. This study also sought to further validate the Piglet Grimace Scale (PGS) as a pain assessment tool. A pilot study first assessed the safety of BUP or 0.2\u00a0mg/kg butorphanol administration to piglets (n\u2009=\u20094 per treatment). When no side effects were noted with BUP, ten litters of 5-day old piglets (n\u2009=\u200960 total, 15 per treatment group) were used, and randomly assigned to one of four possible treatments: BUP (castrated or uncastrated), saline, or sham. Treatments were administered as an intramuscular injection 20\u00a0min prior to surgical castration. Piglets were video recorded 1\u00a0h pre-procedure, post-castration for 8\u00a0h and for another hour, 24\u00a0h post-procedure. Behaviors were scored continuously for the first 15\u00a0min of each hour and 511 still-images of piglet faces were scored using the PGS. Vocalizations were recorded from each piglet at three points in the study: at initial handling, injection, and castration. RESULTS:Butorphanol caused some piglets to become groggy and vomit and was not further evaluated. BUP-castrated piglets demonstrated significantly fewer pain behaviors and less facial grimacing compared to saline-treated pigs (P\u2009<\u20090.0001 and P\u2009=\u20090.0073, respectively). There was no difference between the pain behaviours displayed by BUP-castrated piglets compared to BUP-uncastrated and sham piglets (P\u2009=\u20090.9986 and P\u2009=\u20090.7484). There was also no difference in PGS score between BUP-castrated and BUP-uncastrated piglets (P\u2009=\u20090.9376). Piglets in the BUP-castrated group produced vocalizations of similar frequency, amplitude, power, and energy to saline-treated piglets. CONCLUSIONS:Buprenorphine was highly effective in alleviating castration-associated pain behaviors and facial grimacing in piglets, without causing any obvious side effects. Its administration did not reduce piglet vocalizations at the time of castration. The PGS corresponded well to piglet pain behaviors and has utility as a pain assessment tool."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": ": This case report describes a patient with opioid use disorder who developed cardiac toxicity secondary to non-medical use of loperamide. At recommended doses, loperamide remains in the periphery to treat diarrhea. At high doses, loperamide causes central nervous system (CNS) opioid agonism. Complications of high-dose loperamide have been documented, including cardiotoxicity, and death. This is particularly important in light of the ongoing opioid epidemic. This case presents a patient with sequela of high-dose loperamide as an illicit opioid replacement and the subsequent loperamide toxicity, including significant QTc prolongation. Abrupt cessation of his high-dose loperamide use resulted in opioid withdrawal symptoms, which were treated with buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was selected to avoid possible worsening of QTc secondary to an additional medication, such as methadone. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the use of buprenorphine for treatment of loperamide-associated opioid use disorder. Non-medical use of loperamide requires increased recognition by the health care community, including both physicians and pharmacists, because it can result in marked and life-threatening toxicity."}

This study assessed the association between buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment (MAT) adherence and relapse, health care utilization and costs. Patients and methods:Patients with opioid use disorder who were newly initiating a buprenorphine MAT regimen were identified in the 2008-2014 MarketScan\u00ae Commercial and Medicaid Databases and followed for 12 months after their earliest outpatient pharmacy claim for buprenorphine. Adherence was categorized using proportion of days covered (PDC) with buprenorphine, and patients with PDC\u22650.80 were classified as adherent. Descriptive and adjusted analyses compared relapse prevalence, utilization and costs, all measured in the 12 months following buprenorphine MAT initiation, of adherent patients to patients in non-adherent PDC categories (PDC<0.20, 0.20\u2264PDC<0.40, 0.40\u2264PDC<0.60, 0.60\u2264PDC<0.80). Results:Adherent patients were 37.1% of the Commercial sample (N=16,085) and 41.3% of the Medicaid sample (N=5,688). In both samples, non-adherent patients were significantly more likely than adherent patients to relapse and to have hospitalizations and emergency department visits. As a result, as buprenorphine MAT adherence increased, pharmacy costs increased, but medical costs decreased. Total costs (pharmacy plus medical costs) in the 12 months following buprenorphine MAT initiation decreased with adherence in Commercial patients ($28,525 for PDC<0.20 to $17,844 for PDC\u22650.80). A slight decrease in total costs in the 12 months following buprenorphine MAT initiation was also observed in Medicaid patients ($21,292 for PDC<0.20 to $18,621 for PDC\u22650.80). After adjustment, total costs of adherent patients in the Commercial sample ($17,519) were significantly lower compared with those of non-adherent patients (range $20,294-$24,431). In the Medicaid sample, adjusted total costs were not significantly different between adherence groups. Conclusion:Buprenorphine MAT adherence in the 12 months following treatment was associated with reduced odds of relapse and reduced unadjusted medical costs. For Commercial patients who were adherent to treatment, the adjusted total costs were predicted to be 30% lower than those for patients with PDC<0.20."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:To investigate the pharmacological profile and side effects of buprenorphine administered as a sustained-release formulation in horses. STUDY DESIGN:Pilot trial. ANIMALS:A total of four experimental horses, aged 18-27 years and weighing 508-578\u00a0kg. METHODS:Buprenorphine (0.1\u00a0mg kg-1) was mixed as a freshly prepared sterile solution with a sustained-release drug carrier. It was administered by the subcutaneous (n\u00a0=\u00a02) or intramuscular (n\u00a0=\u00a02) route. During the experiment, the horses were closely monitored, equipped with a step counter and blood samples were collected for quantification of buprenorphine in plasma. RESULTS:All four horses developed colon constipation requiring medical therapy, together with increased locomotor activity. One horse, requiring surgical treatment of colon constipation, was euthanized during recovery from anaesthesia for weakness and severe lower airway obstruction. The three other horses recovered fully within 5-7 days. Plasma buprenorphine concentrations were between 1 and 8\u00a0ng mL-1 for approximately 48 hours. No local reaction was observed at the injection sites. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Administration of the sustained-release formulation of buprenorphine at a dose of 0.1\u00a0mg kg-1 resulted in plasma concentrations compatible with antinociceptive activity for at least 48 hours. The observed severe and undesirable effects of colon constipation and increased locomotor activity definitely preclude clinical use of sustained-release buprenorphine at this dose."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "Many patients with opioid\u00a0use disorder do not have successful outcomes during treatment but the underlying reasons are not well understood. An OPRD1 variant (rs678849) was previously associated with methadone and buprenorphine efficacy in African-Americans with opioid\u00a0use disorder. The objective of this study was to determine if the effect of rs678849 on opioid\u00a0use disorder treatment outcome could be replicated in an independent population. Participants were recruited from African-American patients who had participated in previous studies of methadone or buprenorphine treatment at the outpatient treatment research clinic of the NIDA Intramural Research Program in Baltimore, MD, USA between 2000 and 2017. Rs678849 was genotyped retrospectively, and genotypes were compared with urine drug screen results from the previous studies for opioids other than the one prescribed for treatment. Genotypes were available for 24 methadone patients and 55 buprenorphine patients. After controlling for demographics, the effect of rs678849 genotype was significant in the buprenorphine treatment group (RR\u2009=\u20091.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59-1.79, p\u2009=\u20090.021). Buprenorphine patients with the C/C genotype were more likely to have opioid-positive drug screens than individuals with the C/T or T/T genotypes, replicating the original pharmacogenetic finding. The effect of genotype was not significant in the methadone group (p\u2009=\u20090.087). Thus, the genotype at rs678849 is associated with buprenorphine efficacy in African-Americans being treated for opioid\u00a0use disorder. This replication suggests that rs678849 genotype may be a valuable pharmacogenetic marker for deciding which opioid\u00a0use disorder medication to prescribe in this population."}

METHODS:This retrospective, cohort study evaluated consecutive adults with OUD admitted to an academic medical center over a 5-year period (10/1/11 to 9/30/16). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors for 30 and 90-day readmissions based on pertinent admission, hospital, and discharge variables collected via chart review and found to be different (with a P\u200a<\u200a0.10) on univariate analysis. RESULTS:Among the 470 adults (mean age 43.1\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.8 years, past heroin use 77.9%; admission opioid agonist therapy use [buprenorphine 22.6%; methadone 27.0%]; medical [vs surgical] admission 75.3%, floor [vs ICU] admission 93.0%, in-hospital mortality 0.9%), 85 (18.2%) and 151 (32.1%) were readmitted within 30 and 90 days, respectively.

Regardless of sublingual administration, a notable part of buprenorphine is exposed to extensive first-pass metabolism by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. As drug interaction studies with buprenorphine are limited, we wanted to investigate the effect of voriconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral buprenorphine. METHODS:Twelve healthy volunteers were given either placebo or voriconazole (orally, 400\u00a0mg twice on day 1 and 200\u00a0mg twice on days 2-5) for 5\u00a0days in a randomized, cross-over study. On day 5, they ingested 0.2\u00a0mg (3.6\u00a0mg during placebo phase) oral buprenorphine. We measured plasma and urine concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine and monitored their pharmacological effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters were normalized for a buprenorphine dose of 1.0\u00a0mg. RESULTS:Voriconazole greatly increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-18) of buprenorphine (4.3-fold, P\u2009<\u20090.001), its peak concentration (Cmax) (3.9-fold), half-life (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and excretion into urine (Ae; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Voriconazole also markedly enhanced the Cmax (P\u2009<\u20090.001), AUC0-18 (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and Ae (P\u2009<\u20090.05) of unconjugated norbuprenorphine but decreased its renal clearance (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Mild dizziness and nausea occurred during both study phases. CONCLUSIONS:Voriconazole greatly increases exposure to oral buprenorphine, mainly by inhibiting intestinal and liver CYP3A4. Effect on some transporters may explain elevated norbuprenorphine concentrations. Although oral buprenorphine is not commonly used, this interaction may become relevant in patients receiving sublingual buprenorphine together with voriconazole or other CYP3A4 or transporter inhibitors."}
{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Buprenorphine is usually administered to treat opioid use disorder and pain syndromes. This research presents the first study regarding the effectiveness of different singly administered high doses of buprenorphine (a partial opioid agonist (of \u03bc-opioid receptors), a potent opioid antagonist (of \u03ba-receptors) and a partial agonist of nociception receptors) in reducing suicidal ideation in acutely depressed people with co-morbid opiate dependence. It follows small studies that suggest that ultra-low-dose buprenorphine may be useful in reducing suicidal ideation. The goal of this study was to describe the outcome of different doses of buprenorphine on suicidal opioid-dependent patients over a 3-day interval, by conducting a randomized clinical trial. METHODS:Fifty-one suicidal male inpatients who fulfilled the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for both opioid dependence and major depressive disorder were randomized to three groups (n = 17 per group) to receive a single, sublingual dose of buprenorphine (32\u00a0mg, 64\u00a0mg, or 96\u00a0mg). Out of 51 participants, there were 47 patients; 16 (34.04%) received 32\u00a0mg, 17 (36.17%) received 64\u00a0mg, and 14 (29.78%) received 96\u00a0mg of sublingual buprenorphine. They were evaluated by using psychometric assessment of the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI) and interviews based on DSM-5 criteria. A placebo group was not included because of the high probability of severe withdrawal without active pharmacological treatment. The study was conducted with appropriate precautions and monitoring of respiratory and cardiovascular measures. The medication was administered while the patients were in moderate opiate withdrawal, as indicated by the presence of four to five withdrawal symptoms. A structured clinical interview was conducted, and urine toxicology testing was performed. RESULTS:Patients completed the 3-day trial course. The outcomes illustrated a significant reduction in BSSI scores within each of the three groups, p\u2009<\u20090.01., but no difference in results between the groups, p\u2009=\u20090.408. CONCLUSIONS:The results suggest that a single high dose of buprenorphine could rapidly treat suicidal ideations. A single high dose of buprenorphine may be a main-mechanism medication that gives a rapid treatment for suicidal opioid-dependent patients. Placebo-controlled trials are required to measure the safety and the physiological and psychological effects of this medication."}

The primary end point was maximum effect (Emax ) on the visual analog scale for \"at the moment\" Drug Liking. Emax of Drug Liking for the BUP/SAM 2\u00a0mg/2\u00a0mg dose was similar to that for placebo (median within-subject difference [90% confidence interval]: 2.5 [0.0-9.0]). The supratherapeutic doses of BUP/SAM showed differences of small magnitude on Drug Liking Emax compared to placebo. Drug Liking Emax for all BUP/SAM doses were significantly lower than those observed for either buprenorphine dose alone. Fewer participants reported adverse events associated with abuse potential with BUP/SAM than with buprenorphine alone, and the overall safety profile of BUP/SAM was consistent with prior reports in healthy volunteers. These findings indicate that samidorphan substantially reduces the abuse potential of buprenorphine in the BUP/SAM combination."}

If CMPS-SF scores were\u2009\u2265\u20095/20, dogs were administered rescue analgesia (morphine 0.5\u00a0mg/kg IM). Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models and Fisher's exact test (p\u2009<\u20090.05). RESULTS:Pain and sedation scores and physiological parameters were not significantly different between treatments. Three dogs in VG (25%) and none in SG (0%) required rescue analgesia (p\u2009=\u20090.109). Adverse effects (i.e. vomiting and melena) were observed in two dogs in SG and were thought to be related to stress and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug toxicity. CONCLUSIONS:The administration of buprenorphine with carprofen preoperatively provided adequate postoperative analgesia for the majority of dogs undergoing OVH without serious adverse events. Prevalence of rescue analgesia was not significantly different between groups; however, it could be clinically relevant and explained by a type II error (i.e. small sample size). Future studies are necessary to determine if analgesic efficacy after Simbadol and Vetergesic is related to individual variability or pharmacokinetic differences."}

The degree to which \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist sex differences in nonhuman primates extend to other behavioral endpoints remains unknown. The present study compared the behavioral effects of three MOR ligands (fentanyl, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) that varied in efficacy to stimulate [S]-GTP\u03b3S binding (from highest to lowest: fentanyl, buprenorphine, and naltrexone) in male and female rhesus monkeys. Male (n=3) and female (n=3) monkeys were trained to respond under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule of food presentation during daily sessions consisting of multiple components. Once rates of responding were stable, cumulative dose-effect functions were determined for intramuscular fentanyl (0.00032-0.032\u2009mg/kg), buprenorphine (0.001-1\u2009mg/kg), and naltrexone (0.01-0.1\u2009mg/kg). Fentanyl dose-dependently decreased rates of responding in both sexes and the corresponding ED50 values were not significantly different. Buprenorphine dose-dependently decreased rates of responding in females, but not males. Naltrexone did not significantly alter behavior in either females or males. Overall, these results suggest that the expression of sex differences in MOR pharmacology depends upon both the efficacy of the MOR ligand and the behavioral endpoint."}

Specific reasons for premature discharge generally fall into 2 broad categories (ie, patient- and program-initiated). Previous studies have typically failed to distinguish between different types of discharge reasons among patients who leave treatment early. This study sought to determine whether type of medication was associated with differential discharge reasons among medication treatment patients who were prematurely discharged.Data were derived from electronic health records for 5486 patients prematurely discharged from 41 for-profit licensed opioid treatment programs in the United States from 2012 to 2013. All patients were treated with methadone or buprenorphine. Patients were studied through retrospective chart review until premature discharge.Buprenorphine patients who left treatment prematurely were 2.18 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-2.53) more likely to be discharged against medical advice relative to methadone patients after controlling for intake differences. Methadone patients were 1.76 times (95% CI 1.47-2.10) more likely to be administratively discharged after adjustment for covariates.Further research is warranted to determine whether individually-tailored strategies may improve retention for certain patients based on medication. Ongoing review of program rules and policies may benefit methadone patients, who are nearly twice as likely to be discharged for an administrative, program-initiated reason. Strategies including contingency management, motivational incentives, and psychoeducation regarding the advantages of retention may benefit buprenorphine patients who are over 2 times more likely to leave treatment early due to a patient-initiated reason."}

There is increasing evidence in adult patients that buprenorphine has no ceiling effect on analgesia or side effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine versus morphine in paediatric acute pain.A systematic review of five databases was performed until May 2018. Only randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion. The outcomes of interest included pain, respiratory depression, nausea, sedation, dizziness, and pruritus.Four randomised controlled trials (n=195) were included. The only outcome measuring analgesic efficacy was time to breakthrough analgesia. Buprenorphine had a significant increase in time to breakthrough analgesia by 114.98 minutes compared to morphine (95% CI\u2009=\u200942.94 to 187.01; I2\u2009=\u20090; p=0.002). There was no significant difference in the rates of adverse effects.Buprenorphine provided a longer duration of analgesia than morphine. This in combination with its unique sublingual preparation could prove particularly advantageous in the paediatric population. The studies included are likely underpowered to detect differences in the incidence of adverse effects; therefore, the same precautions should be taken as with any other opioid."}

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "BACKGROUND:It has been previously shown that anesthesia and analgesia can affect outcomes in the rat burn model and that buprenorphine alleviated pain without drastically altering the outcomes of interest. Recently, the use of a sustained release (SR) formulation of buprenorphine has been promoted over conventional buprenorphine. In this study, we assessed whether buprenorphine-SR altered hemodynamic parameters in our rat model of severe burn injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to receive either conventional buprenorphine (0.05\u00a0mg/kg) or buprenorphine-SR (1\u00a0mg/kg). Buprenorphine-SR was administered 24\u00a0h before the experiment. Buprenorphine was administered on the day of experiment. These groups were further randomized to control or scald burn (60% of total body surface area). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured using a noninvasive blood pressure system before receiving analgesia and after 72\u00a0h. RESULTS:As expected, HR was significantly higher after burn injury regardless of analgesic (P\u00a0<0.0001). Both SBP and DBP were significantly decreased in burned animals receiving conventional buprenorphine (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but neither was altered in the buprenorphine-SR-treated burned animals. However, SBP, DBP, and HR were significantly increased after 72\u00a0h in control animals receiving buprenorphine-SR (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). CONCLUSIONS:These data indicate that buprenorphine-SR alters the hemodynamic response to injury and may not be an appropriate choice for a model of severe burn injury. If this analgesic is used, investigators must cautiously form conclusions, especially in experimental conditions that would be expected to alter cardiac hemodynamics."}

Adolescents accounted for 11.1% of exposures; 77.1% were intentional (including 12.0% suspected suicide), and 27.7% involved multiple substances. Among adolescents, the odds of hospital admission and a serious medical outcome were higher for multiple-substance exposures than single-substance exposures.Buprenorphine is important for the treatment of opioid use disorder, but pediatric exposure can result in serious adverse outcomes. Manufacturers should use unit-dose packaging for all buprenorphine products to help prevent unintentional exposure among young children. Health providers should inform caregivers of young children about the dangers of buprenorphine exposure and provide instructions on proper medication storage and disposal.

{"keyword": "Buprenorphine", "texts": "At least 2.3 million people in the U.S. have an opioid use disorder, less than 40% of whom receive evidence-based treatment. Buprenorphine used as part of medication-assisted treatment has high potential to address this gap because of its approval for use in non-specialty outpatient settings, effectiveness at promoting abstinence, and cost effectiveness. However, less than 4% of licensed physicians are approved to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, and approximately 47% of counties lack a buprenorphine-waivered physician. Existing policies contribute to workforce barriers to buprenorphine provision and access. Providers are reticent to prescribe buprenorphine because of workforce barriers, such as (1) insufficient training and education on opioid use disorder treatment, (2) lack of institutional and clinician peer support, (3) poor care coordination, (4) provider stigma, (5) inadequate reimbursement from private and public insurers, and (6) regulatory hurdles to obtain the waiver needed to prescribe buprenorphine in non-addiction specialty treatment settings. Policy pathways to addressing these provider workforce barriers going forward include providing free and easy-to-access education for providers about opioid use disorders and medication-assisted treatment, eliminating buprenorphine waiver requirements for those licensed to prescribe controlled substances, enforcing insurance parity requirements, requiring coverage of evidence-based medication-assisted treatment as essential health benefits, and providing financial incentives for care coordination across healthcare professional types-including behavioral health counselors and other non-physicians in specialty and non-specialty settings.

Buprenorphine is an effective medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD, but access is difficult for patients, especially in rural locations. To improve access, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016 extended the ability to get a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat OUD to nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs). This study summarizes the geographic distribution of waivered physicians, NPs, and PAs at the end of 2017 and compares it to the distribution of waivered physicians 5 years earlier. METHODS:Using the DEA list of providers with a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine to treat OUD and the Area Health Resources File, we assigned waivered providers to counties in 1 of 4 geographic categories. We calculated the number of counties in each category that did not have a waivered provider and county provider to population ratios and then compared our results to the waivered workforce in 2012. FINDINGS:The availability of a physician with a DEA waiver to provide office-based MAT has increased across all geographic categories since 2012. More than half of all rural counties (56.3%) still lack a provider, down from 67.1% in 2012. Almost one-third (29.8%) of rural Americans compared to 2.2% of urban Americans live in a county without a buprenorphine provider. NPs and PAs add otherwise lacking treatment availability in 56 counties (43 rural). CONCLUSIONS:Overall, MAT access has improved, but rural communities still experience treatment disparities."}

The purpose of the present study was to develop the Scale to Assess Satisfaction with Medications for Addiction Treatment-Buprenorphine-Naloxone for Heroin addiction (SASMAT-BUNHER) and to examine its validity and reliability.The SASMAT-BUNHER was developed from a pool of 44 self-administered items grouped into nine theoretical domains, as follows: Overall Satisfaction, Pharmacotherapy, Initiation, Anti-Addictive Effect on Heroin, Mental State, Physical State, Personal Functioning, Acceptability, and Anti-Addictive Effect on Secondary Substances. The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 1.4 version (TSQM 1.4) was used for convergent validation. Participants were 316 heroin-dependent patients in maintenance treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone sublingual tablets at 16 different treatment centres.Principal component analysis of the SASMAT-BUNHER revealed a 5-factor structure that accounted for 65.1% of total variance. Based on similarities between empirically-obtained factors and theoretical domains, Factors 1 through 5 were named 'Mental and Physical State' (10 items), 'Anti-Addictive Effect on Other Substances' (5 items), 'Anti-Addictive Effect on Heroin' (4 items), 'Personal Functioning' (3 items), and 'Acceptability' (4 items). All factors showed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficients: 0.744-0.925) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficients: 0.704-0.895). Correlation between SASMAT-BUNHER and TSQM 1.4 total scores was moderate (Pearson r\u202f=\u202f0.552). Moreover, SASMAT-BUNHER total scores of patients reporting absence of buprenorphine-naloxone side effects were higher than those of their counterparts.These results support the validity and reliability of the SASMAT-BUNHER."}

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered buprenorphine in chinchillas. Using a randomized, blind, controlled, complete crossover design, we evaluated buprenorphine at a single dose of 0.05, 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg SC (experiment A) and 0.2 mg/kg SC (experiment B). Analgesic efficacy was determined by measuring limb withdrawal latencies in response to a thermal noxious stimulus (Hargreaves method) at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h (experiment A) and at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h (experiment B).

Buprenorphine at 0.2 mg/kg SC, but not at 0.05 or 0.1 mg/kg SC, significantly increased limb withdrawal latencies for less than 4 h. Self-limiting reduction in food intake and fecal output occurred after administration at the 0.2-mg/kg dose in animals undergoing algesiometry. In chinchillas not undergoing algesiometry, the administration of 3 doses at 0.2 mg/kg SC every 6 h did not reduce food intake but significantly decreased fecal output for the first 24 h.

METHODS:The study was performed at a single institution over a period of three years (July 1st, 2011 - July 1st, 2014), and included a total of 2280 radiopharmaceutical preparations prepared by four different technologists. All the radiopharmaceutical preparations and quality controls were performed according to each SPC provided by the manufacturer. The radiopharmaceutical preparations were the following (trade names are reported in brackets): 99mTc-albumin colloid [Nanocoll] (n=349), 99mTc-oxidronate [Technescan\u00aehdp] (n=701), 99mTc-exametazime [Ceretec] (n=169), 99mTc-sestamibi [Cardiolite] (n=92), 99mTc-albumin aggregated [Technescan\u00aelyomaa] (n=140), 99mTc-tetrofosmin [Myoview]) (n=567), 99mTc-diethylene triamine pentacetic acid [Technescan\u00aedtpa] (n=254), and 99mTc-dimercapto succinic acid [Renocis\u00ae] (n=8). Data were analyzed to determine the number and type of radiopharmaceutical labelling failure and to derive the sources of these failures to define corrective actions and optimize the quality assurance program. RESULTS:A total of 2280 procedures were performed and recorded. Following the quality control procedure six out of the 2280 preparations (0.26%) were non-conforming for clinical use with the RCP limits indicated in the SPC. Five of these were due to gross technical errors in measurements and manual procedures and were immediately repeated, returning within the limits of acceptability. The sixth failure was due to short incubation time, though compliant with the manufacturer's instructions. CONCLUSIONS:We concluded that the quality of the final product depends on a controlled production system based on the implementation of specific standard operating procedures (ISO9001, SOP) for each radiopharmaceutical production, according to strict adherence to the SPC of each radiopharmaceutical. Based on these conclusions, in our opinion every quality control suggesting a possible error in the synthesis procedure recommended in the SPC should be immediately reported to the manufacturer, for a revision of the SPC, as well as to the regulatory agencies for an alert. This strategy may in fact allow the continuous improvement of the labelling procedures and therefore the optimization of the quality control procedures frequency to ensure both patients safety and a more rational management of resources for economic sustainability."}

In the present study, we examined diabetic patients without a history of cardiovascular disease with negative treadmill test and no signs of systolic dysfunction for presence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy established by measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) and (99m)Tc - Myoview gated-SPET.47 type I and type II diabetic patients were subjected to prospective study including echocardiography and HRV measurement using the combination of Ewing\u00b4s testing and spectral analysis. Subsequently, patients underwent treadmill test and stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Additionally, vascular and metabolic parameters were collected.Treadmill test was negative in all patients. Diastolic dysfunction was found in 10 % of T1DM and 11 % of T2DM patients by echocardiography, whereas none of the patients had systolic dysfunction. SPET confirmed hypoperfusion in 35 % T1DM (p=0.01) and in 60 % T2DM (p=0.001). Diagnosis of cardiac autonomic neuropathy based on Ewing\u00b4s testing and HRV examination was established in 60 % of T1DM patients (p=0.001) and 77 % of T2DM patients (p=0.001). In T1DM group, significant association was found between cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) and frequency of hypoglycaemia (p=0.04). No such correlations were found in patients with T2DM.The results of the present study show high incidence of myocardial hypoperfusion and cardiac autonomic neuropathy among asymptomatic diabetic patients, whereas the standard diagnostic approaches including treadmill test and echocardiography failed to show any changes. Therefore, we conclude that diabetic heart disease remains underdiagnosed by standard approaches, but could be detected in asymptomatic patients by more sensitive methods, such as HRV measurement and myocardial scintigraphy (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, Ref. 26)."}

We hypothesized that a potent mental stressor such as a panic challenge among CAD patients with PD would also induce ischemia in patients with normal exercise stress tests.Forty-one coronary artery disease patients with normal nuclear exercise stress tests (21 patients with PD and 20 without PD) were submitted to a well-established panic challenge test (with 1 vital capacity inhalation of a gas mixture containing 35% CO2 and 65% O2) and injected with Tc-99m-tetrofosmin (Myoview), upon inhalation. Single photon emission computed tomography imaging was used to assess per-panic challenge reversible myocardial ischemia and HR, BP, and a 12 lead ECG was continuously measured during the procedure.Fifty-eight percent of panic disorder patients (12/21) had a panic attack during the panic challenge vs 15% (3/20) of controls (p=0.005). Only 10% of patients in each group displayed myocardial ischemia per panic challenge.These findings suggest that panic attacks among panic disorder patients with lower-risk coronary artery disease may not confer a risk for myocardial ischemia."}
{"keyword": "Myoview", "texts": "The authors have hereby proposed a method to diagnose lower-limb muscular ischaemia by means of scintigraphy, used in 35 patients suffering from atherosclerosis obliterans with stage IIB and III A chronic arterial insufficiency of limbs. To do so, administration of the radioactive agent \"Myoview\" (\u2079\u2079m)Tc-tetrophosmine) manufactured by the \"Nycomed\" Company into a patient's peripheral vein was followed by assessing its accumulation in lower-limb muscles at rest and after standard physical load. Alterations in the parameters studied relative to the norm made it possible to judge on the presence of lower-limb circulatory impairments. The method proved highly efficient, thus making it possible to use it for both therapeutic decision-making and probably in future for dynamic control after the treatment performed. Minimally invasive nature and simplicity in use of the methodology open wide possibilities for its use."}
{"keyword": "Myoview", "texts": "In Her2-positive breast cancer patients,\u00a0inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2)-signaling is often combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The risk of cardiac toxicity after anthracyclines and radiotherapy is recognized, but little is known about increased risk when these treatments are combined with ErbB2 inhibition. This study investigated whether ErbB2 inhibition increased radiation or anthracycline-induced toxicity. In an in vitro study, human cardiomyocytes were treated with irradiation or doxorubicin, alone or in combination with trastuzumab, and evaluated for cell survival and growth. Groups of mice received 0 or 14\u00a0Gy to the heart, alone or in combination with lapatinib, or 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0mg/kg doxorubicin alone or in combination with lapatinib. Mice were evaluated 40\u00a0weeks after treatment for cardiac damage. Changes in cardiac function ((99m)Tc-Myoview gated SPECT) were related to histomorphology and microvascular damage. Radiation or doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity (in vitro) were not exacerbated by trastuzumab. Cardiac irradiation of mice decreased microvascular density (MVD) and increased endothelial damage in surviving capillaries (decrease alkaline phosphatase expression and increased von Willebrand factor), but these changes were not exacerbated by lapatinib. Inflammatory responses in the irradiated epicardium (CD45+ and F4/80+ cells) were significantly reduced in combination with lapatinib. Irradiation, doxorubicin, and lapatinib each induced cardiac fibrosis but this was not further enhanced when treatments were combined. At the ultra-structural level, both lapatinib and doxorubicin induced mitochondrial damage, which was enhanced in combined treatments. Lapatinib alone also induced mild changes in cardiac function but this was not enhanced in the combined treatments. Trastuzumab did not enhance direct radiation or anthracycline toxicity of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Lapatinib did not enhance the risk of radiation or anthracycline-induced cardiac toxicity in mice up to 40\u00a0weeks after treatment, but mitochondrial damage was more severe after doxorubicin combined with lapatinib."}

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model were employed to estimate CAD death or myocardial infarction (MI). Risk reclassification methods were also calculated.In risk-adjusted models (including age, sex, presenting symptoms, stress type, CAD history, and risk factors), stress MPS ischemia, rest and post-stress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (all p < 0.0001) were all significant estimators of CAD death or MI. In this multivariable model, 34% of the model chi-square was contributed by MPS ischemia. In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve increased from 0.61 to 0.66 when rest and post-stress LVEF were combined with pre-test CAD likelihood (p < 0.0001), increasing to 0.69 for MPS ischemia (p < 0.0001). The net reclassification improvement (NRI) by adding the Duke Treadmill Score (DTS) to a model including pre-test CAD likelihood was 0.112. The cost per NRI was $57 for the exercise test as compared with an office visit for risk stratification purposes. Further, the NRI by adding MPS ischemia to a model with the DTS and pre-test CAD likelihood was 0.358. The cost per NRI was $615 for the stress MPS as compared with an exercise test.Stress-induced ischemia is independently predictive of near-term CAD outcomes. Analytical approaches that establish the reclassification of events provide a unique approach and may serve as a quality imaging metric for estimation of improved health outcomes for stress MPS as well as for comparison to other imaging modalities."}

Patients were followed up for the occurrence of CAD events (nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] or death related to MI, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death). Time to CAD event (n = 545) was estimated by use of univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models (risk adjusted by symptoms, risk factors, and comorbid conditions). For patients with no resting defects, overall CAD event rates were 1.2%, 8%, and 10% for patients with 0% ischemic myocardium, 1% to 4.9% ischemic myocardium, and 5% ischemic myocardium or greater, respectively (P < .0001). As the percent myocardium with resting defects worsened, overall CAD event rates increased, such that for patients with 10% or more of the rest myocardium with perfusion defects, cardiovascular death or MI rates ranged from 7% to 44% (P < .0001). In a model including both the percent of the myocardium with resting defects and the percent ischemia, both were highly predictive of CAD events (P < .0001).

A 3% increase in risk of CAD events was observed for patients with every 1% of the myocardium with resting defects (P < .0001).The estimation of CAD risk may be optimally estimated by use of a combination of resting MPS, reflecting a patient's burden of disease, and MPS with provocative ischemia."}

Stress echocardiography is recognized as an alternative to stress nuclear imaging for the general population. The aim of this study is to assess the diagnostic accuracy of stress echocardiography for detecting myocardial ischemia in hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Stress echocardiography and stress technetium-99m-tetrofosmin (Myoview; Amersham International Plc) imaging were performed simultaneously for 66 asymptomatic hemodialysis patients in a single session, using a combination of high-dose dipyridamole and symptom-limited exercise. Coronary angiography was performed in 44 patients with at least one abnormal noninvasive test result or who were considered high-risk despite normal noninvasive test results. RESULTS: Results for stress echocardiography were abnormal in 15 patients (22%); stress Myoview, in 14 patients (21%); and coronary angiography, in 12 patients (18%). The sensitivity of stress echocardiography for detecting myocardial ischemia (defined as stress Myoview defect) was 86%; specificity, 94%; positive predictive value, 80%; negative predictive value, 96%; and overall accuracy, 92%. The sensitivity of stress echocardiography for detecting CAD (defined as abnormal coronary angiography result) was 83%; specificity, 84%; positive predictive value, 67%; negative predictive value, 93%; and overall accuracy, 84%. Stress echocardiography and stress Myoview did not differ significantly in overall accuracy for detecting CAD (84% versus 91%; P = not significant). CONCLUSION: In hemodialysis patients, combined dipyridamole-exercise echocardiography is an accurate method to detect both myocardial ischemia and CAD and represents an alternative to stress nuclear imaging."}

However, myocardial infarction and cardiac dysfunction have been reported in autopsied patients with SCA. When left ventricular functional parameters of gated SPECT and echocardiography were compared incidentally in children with SCA, some 26% of patients were found to have evident myocardial ischaemia. This stimulated the current work with the aim to further analyse these incidental findings and evaluate the possible role of SPECT in early detection of coronary insufficiency in children with SCA.Twenty-seven patients (19 girls, 8 boys), mean age 9.2\u00b14.2 years, with SCA were examined by baseline ECG, echocardiography and gated SPECT. They were all free from any cardiac symptoms. Intravenous injection of 5 to 10 mCi (99M)Tc-MIBI or (99M)Tc-Myoview was administered, according to the predetermined weight-dependent paediatric dose. Stress SPECT was obtained 45 to 60 minutes after tracer injection, which took place at peak physical exercise (6 patients) or 3 to 4 minutes after IV infusion of dipyridamole pharmacological stress (21 patients). Rest SPECT study was acquired 4 to 5 hours later after a second injection of (99M)Tc-MIBI/Myoview. A semiquantitative nine-segment stress/rest bull's eye model was used to assess to the presence/extent of myocardial ischaemia.Myocardial perfusion was normal in 20 patients (74%). Seven patients (26%) had significant perfusion defects in the stress images. Four of them showed perfusion defect in one or two segments. Complete reversibility in the rest study was seen in all patients. Two patients showed a mixture of reversible and fixed perfusion defects in four segments. One patient had evident left ventricular dilatation with multiple fixed and reversible defects (cardiomyopathy). In this case, a diffusely reduced myocardial wall contractility was seen and a low LVEF of 42% as assessed by echocardiography. This was the only case showing agreement between the echo and SPECT findings. In the whole cohort the EF% and FS% by echocardiography were 61.7\u00b15.9% and 33.2\u00b13.4% respectively (mean\u00b1SD). There were no significant relations between myocardial perfusion abnormalities when compared with EF% and FS%; (p>0.05).Cardiac involvement in the form of myocardial ischaemia should be regarded as a high-risk complication in patients with SCA. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy succeeded in the early detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with SCA."}

Time delay between myocardial technetium-labeled tracer administration and SPECT acquisition is usually about 30 minutes after stress, and 45 to 60 minutes at rest: because of the absence of significant redistribution, perfusion images are related to stress even 30 minutes after stress injection, while function and thickening data obtained with gated acquisition 30 minutes after stress are mainly related to rest conditions. METHODS: 194 patients were prospectively included and analyzed, in a multicenter registry. Three gated-SPECT 99(m)Tc-Tetrofosmin studies were performed per patient: GPS-SPECT, 30 minutes post-stress (GS30), and at rest (GR30). RESULTS: GPS image quality was excellent/good (93.9%), and similar to GS30 images (96.6%). The presence of adjacent myocardial sub-diaphragmatic activity on GPS images was similar to GS30 images (24% vs 22%), and less frequent than on GR30 images (31%). For perfusion, thickening, and motion scores, there was no significant difference between early and 30 minute post-stress in the global patient population, but significant differences were observed between GPS and GS30 for LVEF (65% \u00b1 15% vs 63% \u00b1 14%). In the ischemic patients, with the stress-rest protocol, the perfusion score was 14.2 on GPS images and 12.4 on GS30 images (P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Tetrofosmin early GPS-SPECT is feasible without impairment of image quality (better count rate). Ischemic defect size on early post-stress images is slightly more pronounced than at 30 minutes: this could modify therapeutic decision. This technique produces reliable function information during early post-stress period, and might be useful for disclosing transient motion abnormalities."}

The aim of this study was to assess early induction of noninvasive mild hypothermia in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: This was a safety and feasibility study of the Medivance Arctic Sun noninvasive thermoregulatory system (Medivance Inc, Louisville, Colo), used as adjunctive therapy in patients with first-time STEMI. Cooling was initiated by circulating chilled water through the Arctic Sun Energy Transfer Pads placed on the patient before primary PCI. Target temperature was 34.5 degrees C, maintained during 3 hours. Shivering was controlled with intravenous meperidine, and meperidine-related nausea was prevented with intravenous ondansetron. RESULTS: Nine patients underwent successful noninvasive surface cooling. All patients were Killip class I with a mean age of 62 years (8/9 males). Successful primary stenting was performed in all patients with glycoprotein inhibitors administered in 6 of 9 cases. Mean cooling time from induction to target temperature was 79 minutes (49 minutes in the last 4 enrolled cases). Mean total cooling duration was 267 minutes. Mean peak troponin T was 5.81 microg/L. Final TIMI flow grade 3 and final TIMI perfusion grade 3 were achieved in 9 of 9 patients and in 3 of 9 patients, respectively. Mean infarct size (by Myoview single photon emission computed tomography scans) was 23%. No hemodynamic or arrhythmic instability were documented. CONCLUSION: Mild hypothermia can be safely induced with noninvasive surface cooling in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, allowing earlier myocardial protection before mechanical reperfusion therapy."}

The kits were reconstituted with 3.5 GBq 99Tcm-pertechnetate and the average radiochemical purity (RCP) was maintained at 96.5 +/- 1.6% (n = 24) for 24 h. There was no difference in biodistribution between the 1:5 fraction and the full kit, especially with respect to myocardial uptake. These observations show that it is possible to fractionate and store Myoview kits at -80 degrees C and produce a product that is stable over 3 months.

Two new methods of determining RCP were also examined and found to give results that were not significantly different from the recommended manufacturer's method.

{"keyword": "Myoview", "texts": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the feasibility and validity of a new method to quantify the hyperemic response of the forearms that can be incorporated into a rest myocardial perfusion protocol. BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the hyperemic response could provide useful clinical information in the detection and risk stratification of atherosclerotic vascular disease. METHODS: Patients with proven coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 46) were compared with low-risk subjects without such evidence (n = 47). A regular dose of Myoview was injected after 5 min of right arm ischemia. Three dimensionless parametric ratios (right/left) were derived from the analysis of activity-time curves of the hyperemic right forearm and that of the contralateral left forearm. RESULTS: The maximal ingress upslope ratio was 40% lower in the CAD group (3.0 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.2 +/- 0.3, p < 0.0005), and the integral to peak ratio was also lower (23 +/- 4 vs. 52 +/- 11, p < 0.01), whereas the peak activity ratio was nonsignificantly lower (3.0 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.3, p = 0.07). Using a value of 3.55 for the maximal upslope ratio, this approach could predict the presence of CAD with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.60. CONCLUSIONS: This simple and noninvasive method is feasible and can discriminate between patients with known CAD and those at low risk of atherosclerosis. Refinements of this approach and its inclusion in larger clinical trials are needed to determine whether it could provide additional value to myocardial scintigraphic imaging."}

The literature is rich in works on G-SPECT in adults, but lacks data for children. This work evaluates the accuracy of G-SPECT in children, compared to echocardiography.The study comprised 60 children. Eighteen with history of sickle cell disease, 5 dilated cardiomyopathy, 12 valvular heart disease and one with hyperlipidaemia. Other 24 children free from cardiac problems were included. All patients were given 185-370 MBq (5-10 mCi) of 99mTc-MIBI or 99mTc-Myoview. Resting G-SPECT was acquired 45-60 min after injection. LV volumes and EF were measured by G-SPECT and echocardiography.In all 60 cases, the correlation coefficients between both methods were 0.66 for EDV, 0.73 for ESV and 0.42 for EF. The 36 diseased children yielded fair to weak correlations for EDV, ESV and EF (r = 0.69, 0.74 and 0.41 respectively). The EDV was larger by echocardiography than G-SPECT (81.95 +/- 28.87 vs. 65.91 +/- 31.59 ml, p < 0.01). The ESV was also larger by echocardiography (39.13 +/- 15.96 vs. 23.44 +/- 18.04 ml, p < 0.01). The EF by G-SPECT (67.32 +/- 11.63%) was higher than by echocardiography (52.65 +/- 11.77%), (p < 0.01). The 24 normal subjects yielded almost the same level of weak correlation between both methods for EDV, ESV and EF (r = 0.59, 0.69, and 0.44 respectively).LV volumes and EF computed by G-SPECT correlated poorly with echocardiography in small ventricles.

AIM: To evaluate the relationship between the presence of ischaemia during an adenosine stress test and the changes in left ventricular (LV) function obtained after stress and at rest with gated SPET by using adenosine same-day stress and rest protocol. METHODS: The study population consisted of twenty eight patients. The gated SPET acquisition was performed both after adenosine vasodilatation and at rest with a protocol as follows: 300 MBq of Tc-99m Myoview at stress, 700 MBq reinjection at rest and double head gamma camera. Global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (EDV, ESV) as well as the regional wall motion reversibility from post-stress and resting scan were analysed. RESULTS: Wall motion disturbances were present in the stress study in 15 patients with subsequent improvement in 14 cases on the rest scans. An independent evaluation of the perfusion data revealed significant reversible myocardial ischaemia in 18 patients and negative result in 10. There was a significant difference between EDV change in patients with or without ischaemia (p<0.02). The post-stress LVEF and ESV were significantly different from those measured at rest. Reversible regional wall motion impairment indicated the presence of significant reversible myocardial ischaemia with an 88% positive predictive value (70% and 75% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The post-stress LVEF with gated SPET may not reflect true resting measurements. The qualitative assessment of regional wall motion reversibility shows better correlation with the ischaemic scan pattern than the difference in the LVEF and may be helpful in assessing the significance of reversible myocardial ischaemia."}

METHODS: The first 500 consecutive patients, referred to our facility for coronary artery disease (CAD) assessment, were included in this study. Myocardial SPECT was performed after i.v. of 740 MBq of (99m)Tc Tetrofosmin (Myoview, Amersham Health) both after stress and at rest. Studies were acquired by means of a 3 head system (IRIX, Philips Medical System) equipped with the Beacontm option to correct for non-uniform attenuation. Out of the whole population studied, 130 patients underwent coronary angiography (CAG), 108 of which were proven to be affected by significant CAD, defined as a >50% coronary vessel lumen reduction. Attenuation corrected (AC) as well as non-attenuation corrected studies (NAC) were reconstructed, blindly read and qualified as: normal; borderline normal; borderline abnormal and definitely abnormal. RESULTS: In the group of 130 patients who underwent CAG, sensitivity for CAD detection did not vary significantly (96% and 93%, for NAC and AC studies, respectively, p=ns) whereas specificity increased from 73% (NAC studies) to 91% (AC studies), p<0.01. Normalcy rate, assessed in a small subgroup (n=21) with a <5% likelihood for CAD, was found to be 80% for NAC studies vs 93% for AC studies (p<0.05). As regards synthetic clinical judgements, when we grouped normal and probably normal readings into a single ''normal'' category and, conversely, probably abnormal and definitely abnormal into a single ''pathological'' category, we see that after attenuation correction studies reported as ''pathological'' are reclassified as ''normal'' in 17.8% of the cases (25.2% in males and 6.9% in females, p<0.05). The opposite is seen in only 1.6% of the cases (1.3% in males and 4.4% in females). According to established criteria, 155 patients were classified at low risk for CAD (<15%), 115 at intermediate risk (from >15% to <50%) and 230 at high risk (>50%). The intermediate risk class showed the greatest impact: ''normal'' findings increased from 52% to 72%, thus reducing the rate of ''pathological'' reports from 48% to 28%. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, while sensitivity for CAD is not affected by attenuation correction, specificity increases significantly, as well as normalcy rate. Out of the whole population studied, the main finding was that attenuation correction increases the rate of normal reports, more frequently in males than in females, and that studies carried out in patients at intermediate risk for CAD are more likely to be affected."}
{"keyword": "Myoview", "texts": "PURPOSE: To determine the mechanism of myocardial ischemia in patients with sickle beta-thalassemia, we performed a scintigraphic evaluation of myocardial perfusion during exercise. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 30 patients with sickle beta-thalassemia, (mean [+/-SD] age, 37 +/- 10 years) who had no electrocardiographic (ECG), radiographic, or echo-Doppler signs of pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, or impaired contractility. All patients had a hemoglobin level greater than 7 g/dL. Treadmill exercise test was performed according to the Bruce protocol. Myocardial perfusion was assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography, using Tetrofosmin Tc-99 m Myoview as radiotracer, at peak exercise and again 4 hours later. RESULTS: Eight patients (27%) developed stress-induced scintigraphic perfusion abnormalities that were reversible in all but 1 patient. Subsequent coronary angiograms were normal in all 8 patients. ST segment depression was seen during exercise in 5 of the 7 patients who had reversible perfusion defects. Except for a significantly greater white blood cell count, these 5 patients did not differ from the rest of patients by sex, age, hemoglobin level, percentage hemoglobin F, beta-thalassemia genotype, or risk factors for coronary artery disease. Three of the 5 patients with perfusion and ECG abnormalities (and another with only perfusion defects) developed a stress-induced sickling crisis. CONCLUSION: Physical stress may induce myocardial ischemia in sickle beta-thalassemia patients with normal coronary arteries and elicit painful crises. The sickling process, activated by exercise, could be the common underlying mechanism."}

The localization of defects by SPET in relation to the perfusion territories of stenosed vessels (>/=50%) was achieved with a sensitivity of 64% for the left anterior descending artery, 49% for the left circumflex artery and 86% for the right coronary artery, and an accuracy of 71%, 72% and 73% respectively. Concordance of SPET and CA was 62% for single-vessel disease and 68% for multivessel disease. In conclusion, this Spanish-Portuguese multicentre clinical trial confirmed, in a considerable number of patients who underwent coronary angiography, the feasibility of 99mTc tetrofosmin (Myoview) rest/stress myocardial SPET using a very short protocol (2 h)."}

{"keyword": "Myoview", "texts": "AIM: Of the study was to show that changing patient position from supine to prone results in improved specificity of myocardial SPECT (MS). METHODS: We examined the influence of patient position in MS on the diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 151 patients. By using a Tc-99m-labeled compound (Tetrofosmin, Myoview, Nycomed, Amersham) examinations could be performed in supine and prone position within 35 minutes. Examinations were performed as a two-day stress-rest protocol with one gamma camera head and 180 degrees rotation without absorption correction. RESULTS: Semi-quantitative patient and heart phantom data show similar values for anterior and inferior wall in prone position in contrast to a lower count ratio of inferior to anterior wall in supine position. This demonstrates the importance of patient position with respect to artifacts specificity. Changing patient position from supine to prone mainly improves diagnostic specificity for CHD in the inferior wall in men (from 58% to 90%) and in the anterior wall in women (from 80% to 93%). Sensitivity is the same for both techniques. CONCLUSION: Changing patient position from supine to prone significantly improves diagnostic specificity while sensitivity remains unchanged."}

Twenty-seven female patients with suspected breast cancer were included in the study. Twenty mCi of 99mTc-tetrofosmin were administered intravenously. Imaging was begun 10 min post-injection. In twenty-three patients, breast cancer was detected using 99mTc-tetrofosmin scintigraphy. Two carcinomas were missed. In two patients, both breast scintigraphy and intraoperative biopsies were negative. Our preliminary results suggest that this product may have a role in the differentiation of benign from malignant lesions, and were encouraging in terms of its potential usefulness as a marker of malignancy."}

METHOD: Twelve patients with elevated thyroglobulin (Tg) levels of more than 10 ng/ml (group A), four of these had negative I-131 scans, and three patients with Tg levels less than 10 ng/ml (group B) were examined under TSH suppressive L-Thyroxine treatment. Whole body scans were taken with Tl-201 (74 MBq: 20 mn post injection), Tc-99m-sestamibi (370 MBq: 20-60 min post injection) and Tc-99m-tetrofosmin (370 MBq: 20-60 min post injection). Tumor/background ratios and optional time/activity analyses (up to 150 min post injection) were evaluated using the region of interest approach. RESULTS: Compared with Tl-201 (T/BG: 1.59, +/- 0.396). Tc-99m-tetrofosmin showed slightly but not significant better T/BG ratios and detection rates (T/BG: 1.76, +/- 0.345).

However, by the inclusion of 5% w/v oleic acid, which is used in myocardial metabolism, partitioning was enhanced by amounts which varied depending on the tendency to form complex/oleate ion-pairs. Transfer to the receptor compartment was increased for most complexes when given sufficient time to diffuse through the membrane. The complex [99mTc O2 (tetrofosmin)2]+ appeared to form particularly stable ion-pairs with oleic acid. Monolayer formation also indicated ion-pairing interactions.The results suggested that whether or not a complex is taken up by the myocyte may depend on its ability to 'hitch a ride' by ion-pairing with the myocytes energy source--a molecule of long chain fatty acid."}

Recently some Tc-99m labeled myocardial perfusion agents were introduced, that might be more important for nuclear oncology in the future. Aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the reliability of the new non-specific tumor searching tracer tetrofosmin (Myoview) in the post operative follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma during TSH suppressive thyroid hormone treatment and to compare the results in patients with metastasizing DTC to Tc-99m sestamibi (Cardiolite) and TI-201. In a pilot study 12 patients with elevated thyroglobulin (Tg) levels of more than 10 ng/ml and known metastatic disease were examined under TSH suppressive L-Thyroxine treatment comparing TI-201, Tc-99m sestamibi and Tc-99m terofosmin whole body scintigraphy (WBS). Furthermore in 146 consecutive follow up patients tetrofosmin WBS was performed under TSH-suppressive L-T4 treatment. The results were compared to serum thyroglobulin (Tg), ultrasonography (US) of the neck, I-131 whole body scintigraphy (I-131 WBS), transmission computed tomography (TCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scintigraphy. Whole body scans were performed with TI-201 (74 MBq; 20 min post injection), Tc-99m sestamibi (370 MBq; 20-60 min post injection) and Tc-99m tetrofosmin (370 MBq; 20-60 min post injection). Tumor/background ratios and optional time/activity analyses (up to 120 min post injection) were evaluated using the region of interest approach. In the pilot study tetrofosmin showed the highest T/BG ratios and detection rates (T/BG: 1.76 +/- 0.345) followed by TI-201 (T/BG: 1.59 +/- 0.396) and sestamibi (1.51 +/- 0.31 p = 0.05). From the 146 patients investigated consecutively with Tc-99m tetrofosmin WBS for the routine follow up of DTC, 88 patients (no thyroid remnants, no history of metastases or tumor recurrence) were tumor free. All of them resulted in negative Tc-99m tetrofosmin WBS. Another 32 patients (papillary carcinoma pT1) were also in complete remission, but had sonographically proven remnants (echonormal). Twenty one of them exhibited certain Tc-99m tetrofosmin accumulation in the thyroid bed. In 9 cases with local recurrence as confirmed by histopathology after reoperation or by cytology after fine needle aspiration, the tetrofosmin scintigraphy clearly revealed relapse of malignancy including 2 patients with tetrofosmin positive additional distant metastases. Seventeen patients had distant metastases (11 pulmonary, 3 bone, 2 bone and pulmonary, 1 bone and soft tissue) detected by different modalities and resulting in a total of 44 lesions to be evaluated. In the 23 radioiodine negative metastases, 17 were also detected by tetrofosmin (74%). In the 21 radioiodine accumulating lesions 19 were Tc-99m tetrofosmin positive (90%). Four cases with radioiodine negative disseminated lung metastases showed diffuse pulmonary tetrofosmin uptake. This prospective study shows that Tc-99m tetrofosmin is a new promising tracer to detect malignant recurrence and distant metastases in the follow up of DTC without the necessity of thyroid hormone withdrawl, especially in patients with elevated Tg level and no iodine uptake. Tc-99m tetrofosmin shows slight advantages concerning T/Bg Ratio, background clearance, detection rate and dosimetry compared with TI-201 and Tc-99m sestamibi."}

Severe hypotension occurred more often in the tizanidine group (2.03%; n\u00a0=\u00a033) than the cyclobenzaprine group (1.28%; n\u00a0=\u00a064); odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.60; P\u00a0=\u00a00.029.

Because shivering has deleterious metabolic and cardiovascular effects, it should ideally be prevented by pharmacologic or other means. Tizanidine is an alpha-2 agonist. We evaluated the usefulness of oral tizanidine (TI) and tramadol in preventing of shivering in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Materials and Methods:Ninety patients, scheduled for TURP with spinal anesthesia, were prospectively enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. 90 min before spinal anesthesia, 30 patients received 4 mg oral TI, 30 patients received 50 mg tramadol, and 30 patients received placebo as control group. Spinal anesthesia was induced at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspaces with 12.5 mg bupivacaine. An investigator blinded to the drugs recorded the frequency and degree of shivering. Results:The overall frequency and severity of shivering were significantly lower in patients treated with TI and tramadol compared to placebo (P = 0.04) (P = 0.001). There was not much difference in the nausea and vomiting of both the drugs (P = 026) (P = 011). There was no difference in hemodynamic parameters between three groups (P = 0.08) (P = 013). Conclusions:Oral TI and tramadol were comparable in respect to their effect in decreasing the incidence, intensity shivering when used prophylactically in patients who underwent TURP with spinal anesthesia."}

{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "In chronic hemiparetic stroke, increased shoulder abductor activity causes involuntary increases in elbow, wrist, and finger flexor activation, an abnormal muscle coactivation pattern known as the flexion synergy. Recent evidence suggests that flexion synergy expression may reflect recruitment of contralesional cortico-reticulospinal motor pathways following damage to the ipsilesional corticospinal tract. However, because reticulospinal motor pathways produce relatively weak post-synaptic potentials in motoneurons, it is unknown how preferential use of these pathways could lead to robust muscle activation. Here, we hypothesize that the descending neuromodulatory component of the ponto-medullary reticular formation, which uses the monoaminergic neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin, serves as a gain control mechanism to facilitate motoneuron responses to reticulospinal motor commands. Thus, inhibition of the neuromodulatory component would reduce flexion synergy expression by disfacilitating spinal motoneurons. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a pre-clinical study utilizing two targeted neuropharmacological probes and inert placebo in a cohort of 16 individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Test compounds included Tizanidine (TIZ), a noradrenergic \u03b12 agonist and imidazoline ligand selected for its ability to reduce descending noradrenergic drive, and Isradipine, a dihyropyridine calcium-channel antagonist selected for its ability to post-synaptically mitigate a portion of the excitatory effects of monoamines on motoneurons. We used a previously validated robotic measure to quantify flexion synergy expression. We found that Tizanidine significantly reduced expression of the flexion synergy. A predominantly spinal action for this effect is unlikely because Tizanidine is an agonist acting on a baseline of spinal noradrenergic drive that is likely to be pathologically enhanced post-stroke due to increased reliance on cortico-reticulospinal motor pathways. Although spinal actions of TIZ cannot be excluded, particularly from Group II pathways, our finding is consistent with a supraspinal action of Tizanidine to reduce descending noradrenergic drive and disfacilitate motoneurons. The effects of Isradipine were not different from placebo, likely related to poor central bioavailability. These results support the hypothesis that the descending monoaminergic component of the ponto-medullary reticular formation plays a key role in flexion synergy expression in chronic hemiparetic stroke. These results may provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies to complement physical rehabilitation."}

The incorporation of the thiol group considerably promoted mucoadhesive strength of the polymer-viz. 3.99-fold. Moreover, in vivo safety analysis in albino rats revealed TAX to be safe in the concentration range of 750-1000 mg kg-1 body weight. Synthesized TAX was utilized to prepare Tizanidine HCl (TZN HCl) loaded sustained release (SR) mucoadhesive buccal films using a solvent casting technique. Results proved that the prepared films were of uniform thickness, good mechanical strength (with folding endurance >300), acceptable moisture contents (5%-7%) and surface pH (6.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.81 to 6.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.49) compatible to that of the buccal cavity.

Results of in vitro dissolution studies and ex vivo permeation studies conducted respectively by USP dissolution apparatus II and Franz diffusion cell indicated that sustained effect of TAX was achieved for 8 h.

Various pharmacokinetic parameters including AUC, Cmax, tmax and t1/2 of both drugs loaded in films were compared with standard solution/dispersion administered to the rabbits at the dose of 1mg/kg. The results unveiled instant release and permeation of MLX from IR layer, while good controlled release and permeation characteristics of TZN from SR films over 8 h. films were of uniform thickness with smooth surface and satisfactory mechanical strength. Mucoadhesion strength was sufficient to provide suitable contact time with mucosal membrane. The pharmacokinetic study exhibited prompt absorption of MLX with better AUC 0-t (6655.64 ng/ml*h vs 6538.99 ng/ml*h) and Cmax (436.98 ng/ml vs 411.33 ng/ml) from oral dispersion. Similarly buccal films has shown enhanced half-life (9.91hr vs 2.51 hr), AUC 0-t (1043.4 ng/ml*h vs 149.1 ng/ml*h) and Cmax (91.92 ng/ml vs 42.29 ng/ml) from oral solution. A statistical investigation disclosed a significantly improved pharmacokinetics of TZN and MLX after their absorption across buccal route following administration of buccal film (p<0.05). ARX proved expedient and bilayer buccal films as a drug delivery system ascertained the dual effect of providing instant release of one active agent and persistent release of another one with improved pharmacokinetics."}

We experienced a case of complicating prolonged myocardial dysfunction in a 56-year-old woman. Six hours after overdose of 48\u00a0mg tizanidine and 24\u00a0mg etizolam, she showed sinus bradycardia and peripheral vascular resistance decreasing shock. At that time new ST-T depressions were recognized in electrocardiography (ECG); however, structural heart diseases were interpreted as negative by other examinations. Intravenous norepinephrine infusion was useful to maintain the hemodynamic stability. ECG reversed to normal findings on day 14; however, the cardiac nuclear medicine studies on day 30 showed severe fatty metabolic disorder and sympathetic denervation. Non-sustained ventricular tachycardia was detected. Complete recovery of the myocardium damage required one year. For one mechanism, it was suggested that over-stimulation of \u03b12-receptor by tizanidine inhibited the norepinephrine secretion and reuptake at pre-synaptic surface of adipose cell and cardiac sympathetic nerve. We want to suggest that the cardiologist should consider the risk of fatal arrhythmia and long-term myocardium toxicity as the poisoning of the central muscle relaxant and benzodiazepine agent. <Learning objective: We experienced a case of complicating prolonged myocardial dysfunction in a 56-year-old woman.

Thus, after intrathecal delivery, formation of space-occupying, meningeally-derived masses may be related to local MC degranulation. We systematically characterized degranulating effects of opioid and nonopioid analgesics on cutaneous flares in the dog and in primary human MC (hMC) cultures.Dogs were anesthetized with IV propofol and received intradermal (ID) injections (50\u03bcL). Flare diameters were measured at 30min. Drugs showing flare responses were tested after intramuscular (IM) cromolyn (10mg/kg), a MC stabilizer. Human primary MCs (human cord blood CD34+/CD45+ cells) were employed and \u03b2-hexosaminidase in cell-free supernatants were measured to assess degranulation.A significant skin flare for several classes of agents was observed including opioids, ziconotide, ketamine, ST-91, neostigmine, adenosine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, MK-801 and 48/80. Tizanidine, fentanyl, alfentanil, gabapentin and baclofen produced no flare. Flare produced by all ID agents, except adenosine, bupivacaine and lidocaine, was reduced by cromolyn. Naloxone had no effect upon opiate or 48/80 evoked flares. In hMC studies, 48/80 resulted in a concentration-dependent release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase. The rank order of drug-induced hMC \u03b2-hexosaminidase release was similar to that for flares.A variety of therapeutically useful drugs degranulate MCs. This action may account for side effects such as the intrathecal granuloma resulting from spinally-delivered opioids. This degranulating effect may be useful in predicting potential intrathecal toxicity in the development of novel agents."}

Gait function was evaluated using clinical outcome measures of gait, speed and endurance. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic effects, maximal strength, active range of motion (AROM) and peak velocity (Vp) of ankle dorsi- and planter-flexor muscles were also measured. Differences were assessed using two-way mixed design analysis of variance. The number of subjects that achieved the minimal important difference (MID) for clinical scores was also measured for each group, and the results of those that did attain the MID were compared with those that did not.Both LTT and TizLTT resulted in significant improvements in walking speed and dorsiflexion maximum strength, with no significant differences between them, using group-averaging analysis. However, using the MID analysis, a higher proportion of subjects in the TizLTT group achieved the MID for walking speed (40%) compared with LTT alone (13%). Those that achieved the MID for walking speed were significantly higher functioning at baseline than those that did not in the TizLTT group, and the change in walking speed was associated with the change in dorsiflexion peak velocity (R(2)\u2009=\u20090.40; P\u2009<\u20090.05).Tizanidine appears to facilitate the effects of LTT on gait function in individuals with chronic SCI that are higher functioning at baseline. We speculate that this may be due to restoration of inhibitory mechanisms by Tizanidine, resulting in greater stretch in the planterflexor muscles during the LTT."}

Subjects were randomly divided to three groups: Lok, Tiz, and Cont. LOKOMAT training was performed 3 days/week for 4 weeks, with up to 45 minutes of training per session. Tizanidine (2mg) was administered (4\\day), for 4 weeks. Subjects in Cont group received no intervention. The participants were evaluated before and after 4 weeks of training, and the effects of training on the intrinsic (muscular) and reflexive components of the neuromuscular properties were quantified over the ankle range-of-motion. A parallel-cascade system identification technique was used to determine the reflex and intrinsic stiffness of the ankle joint as a function of ankle position at each time point. The intercept and slope of the stiffness vs. joint angle curve were then calculated and tracked over the four-week period. The number of subjects that achieved the minimally important difference (MID) for the intercepts and slopes, and levels of changes were compared. Both Lokomat and tizanidine resulted in significant reduction in both intercept and slope of reflex and intrinsic stiffness. However, a higher proportion of subjects in Lok group achieved the MID for the reflex (>90%) and intrinsic (65-78%) parameters compared with Tiz group (up to 63% and 25% for reflex and intrinsic parameters, respectively). The levels of reduction were also higher in the Lok than the Tiz group. No one in the Cont group achieved the MID. Our findings demonstrate that LOKOMAT training can be more efficient in modifying neuromuscular abnormalities associated with spasticity than tizanidine."}

{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "Tizanidine HCl is a skeletal muscle relaxant that suffers from extensive hepatic metabolism resulting in 34-40% oral bioavailability. It also suffers from short half-life (2.1-4.2h) that necessitates frequent administration thus reducing patient compliance. In addition, tizanidine HCl is water soluble, so it is a challenging candidate for controlled drug delivery. In our study, tizanidine was encapsulated in chitosan lactate beads cross-linked with sodium tripolyphosphate. The beads were further incorporated into chitosan lactate wafer to be easily applied to buccal mucosa, aiming to bypass the hepatic metabolism. A central composite face-centered design was applied to statistically optimize the formulation variables; tripolyphosphate concentration, chitosan lactate concentration and polymer/drug ratio. The optimized formula suggested by the software composed of; 3.03% tripolyphosphate, 4.92% chitosan lactate and 2.13 polymer/drug ratio. It provided encapsulation efficiency of 56.5% and controlled tizanidine release over 8h. It is also characterized by being mucoadhesive and nonirritant. Pharmacokinetic parameters of tizanidine from the optimized formula were compared to those of the immediate release tablet, Sirdalud(\u00ae), as reference in human volunteers using a randomized crossover design.

Therefore, the nasal route of administration, which bypasses portal circulation, may increase the bioavailability of tizanidine and, possibly, reduce the time to peak plasma concentration, thereby shorting the latency of therapeutic effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of tizanidine nasal spray and compare it to the profile of tizanidine oral tablets.This open-label, phase I study comprised two protocols: protocol 1, tizanidine HCl solution (32.73 mg/mL) intranasally at single doses of 2 and 4 mg versus 4 mg tizanidine oral tablets (randomized, three periods crossover, 12 healthy subjects); and protocol 2, tizanidine HCl solution (16.36 mg/mL) intranasally at a single dose of 1 mg vs. 4 mg tizanidine oral tablets (randomized, two periods crossover, 12 healthy subjects, one dropout). Tizanidine plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.There was a linear relationship between different dosages of intranasal formulation and the area under the concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)). The relative bioavailability of the different dosages of intranasal formulation were 1.29, 1.93, and 4.23 for 1, 2, and 4 mg intranasal administration, respectively. Comparison of C(max) values gave the following ratios: 0.91, 1.39, and 2.73, for 1, 2, and 4 mg intranasal administration, respectively. The mean time to C(max) (t(max)) was 0.99, 0.43, and 0.63 h for 1, 2, and 4 mg intranasal administration, respectively, whereas it was 1.13 and 1.30 h for the two series of 4 mg tizanidine oral tablets.The bioavailability of the tizanidine intranasal formulation was higher than that of tizanidine oral tablets. The t(max) was also shorter with the intranasal formulation. No serious adverse events occurred throughout the study, such that the two formulations resulted equally well-tolerated. The intranasal formulation of tizanidine results are therefore worthy of subsequent clinical testing in phase II."}

Following the flow of the river, a traveling water mass was sampled using weekly flow-proportional composite samples at ten different downstream sites, including main tributaries. Using a broad analytical method based on solid phase extraction and high-resolution mass spectrometry, the water was analyzed for more than 300 target substances. While the water in Lake Constance contained only 83 substances in often low concentrations, the number of detects found in the water phase increased to 143 substances and a weekly load of more than 7 tons at the last sampling site, the Dutch-German border. Mostly present were chemicals originating from wastewater treatment plants, especially the artificial sweetener Acesulfam and two pharmaceuticals, Metformin and Gabapentin, which dominate the weekly load up to 58%. Although the sample campaign was performed in a dry period in early spring, a large variety of pesticides and biocides were detected. Several industrial point sources were identified along the waterway's 900 km journey, resulting in high concentrations in the tributaries and loads of up to 160 kg. Additionally, an unbiased non-target analysis was performed following two different strategies for the prioritization of hundreds of potentially relevant unknown masses. While for the first prioritization strategy, only chlorinated compounds were extracted from the mass spectrometer datasets, the second prioritization strategy was performed using a systematic reduction approach between the different sampling sites. Among others, two substances that never had been detected before in this river, namely, the muscle relaxant Tizanidine and the solvent 1,3-Dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI), were identified and confirmed, and their loads were roughly estimated along the river."}
{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of antispastic drugs baclofen and tizanidine on reflexes and volitional tasks. DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, before-after trial, pilot study. SETTING: Research laboratory in a rehabilitation hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Men with chronic (>6mo) motor incomplete spinal cord injury (N=10) were recruited for the study. INTERVENTIONS: Tizanidine, baclofen, and placebo were tested in this study. Agents were tested in separate experimental sessions separated by >1 week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reflex and strength were measured before and after the administration of a single dose of each intervention agent. Electromyographic and joint torque data were collected during assessments of plantar flexor stretch reflexes, maximum contraction during motor-assisted isokinetic movements, and maximum isometric knee extension and flexion. RESULTS: Reduced stretch reflex activity was observed after the administration of either tizanidine or baclofen. We observed that tizanidine had a stronger inhibitory effect on knee extensors and plantar flexors whereas baclofen had a stronger inhibitory effect on the knee flexors. The effects of these drugs on strength during isometric and isokinetic tasks varied across participants, without a consistent reduction in torque output despite decreased electromyographic activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that antispastic drugs are effective in reducing stretch reflexes without substantially reducing volitional torque. Differential effects of tizanidine and baclofen on reflexes of flexors and extensors warrant further investigation into patient-specific management of antispastic drugs."}

Spasticity in the muscles surrounding the ankle joint caused by hypertonia is often reported as a complication. We investigated whether a pharmacological intervention using Tizanidine, an anti-spastic medication acting as an \u03b12-adrenergic agonist, could lead to improvements in walking endurance. We placed subjects on a 4-week program and measured the change in clinical measures of walking speed, endurance, and mobility. We used growth mixture modeling (GMM) to class subjects into groups based on recovery patterns. Two classes of recovery were found by GMM: high and low functioning. Radom coefficient regression (RCR) was then used to identify significant changes over time. Statistically significant improvements in walking endurance were shown for the high functioning group. However, a small number of subjects in the high functioning group showed improvement greater than the smallest real difference (SRD), which indicates a clinical significance as well. We also investigated the extent to which these recovery patterns can be predicted using baseline measures. Baseline walking endurance was found to be a robust predictor of recovery in walking endurance. Subjects that began the intervention with already higher endurance showed a greater chance of improvement in endurance over time. This information could potentially be used as a fast and reliable assessment tool for clinicians to predict which patient can benefit the most from this intervention prior to prescribing the medication, and thus optimizing cost and resources. Our findings demonstrate that these techniques can be used to characterize and predict the progress of changes to functional impairments due to various types of intervention."}
{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and tolerability of tizanidine for the treatment of dysfunctional voiding in children compared with those of doxazosin. METHODS: A total of 40 children with dysfunctional voiding were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, 2-parallel group, flexible-dose study. The evaluations were performed in accordance with the International Children's Continence Society guidelines. The children were followed up after 1 week and then monthly for 6 months for the clinical, urine culture, and urodynamic parameters. The degree of improvement was assessed using a satisfaction scale that ranged from 0 (no improvement at all) to 10 (total improvement). RESULTS: A total of 40 patients with a mean\u00b1SD age of 7\u00b12.6 years were enrolled. The clinical and urodynamic parameters were comparable between both groups. At the last follow-up visit, both groups had had similar improvement in the severity of symptoms, satisfaction scale, and noninvasive flowmetry parameters. In the doxazosin group, urge episodes was the only symptom that showed a significant reduction compared with the baseline values (P=.028). However, the incidence of nocturnal enuresis, urgency attacks, and daytime incontinence were significantly reduced compared with baseline in the tizanidine group (P=.003, P=.008, and P=.017, respectively). Adverse effects were recorded in 6 patients (15%). Epigasteric pain was reported in 2 children (10%) who received doxazosin. In the tizanidine group, a loss of appetite was noted in 2 children (10%), epigastric pain in 1 (5%), and headache in 1 (5%). CONCLUSION: Tizanidine could be a safe and effective treatment of children with dysfunctional voiding due to pelvic floor/skeletal sphincter dysfunction. More placebo-controlled trails with larger sample sizes are needed."}

Our aim is to develop a patient-friendly dosage form that is capable of extending release of short elimination half-life drugs so to decrease dosing frequency and to increase the bioavailability of highly-metabolized drugs with the ultimate aim of dose reduction. Tizanidine hydrochloride (TIZ) was used as a model drug.TIZ was incorporated into Compritol-based hot-melts, and then further formulated into buccal patches prepared using HPMC, PVA and Polyox. A Central Composite Face-centered Design was employed to statistically optimize the formulation variables; HPMC solution/PVA solution weight ratio, Compritol/TIZ ratio in the hot-melts and percentage Polyox. The optimized formula suggested by the software was successful in controlling drug release, where 85% of TIZ was released after 4 h and the patch showed acceptable mucoadhesion properties. Pharmacokinetic parameters of TIZ from the optimized formula were compared to those of the immediate release tablet, Sirdalud\u00ae, as reference in human volunteers using a randomized crossover design. Significant increase was observed for Cmax, Tmax, AUC(0-12) and AUC(0-1). The increase in relative bioavailability of TIZ from the optimized formula was 2.57 folds."}
{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "The morphology of gelatin nanoparticles loaded with three different drugs (Tizanidine hydrochloride, Gatifloxacin and Fluconazole) and their characteristics of entrapment and release from gelatin nanoparticles were investigated by the analysis on nanoparticle size distribution, SEM and FT-IR in this study. The particles were prepared by nanoprecipitation using water and ethanol as a solvent and a nonsolvent, respectively. The exclusion of a crosslinking agent from the procedure led the system to have an irregularly-shaped morphology. Nonetheless, the uncrosslinked case of Gatifloxacin loading generally led to a more homogeneous population of nanoparticles than the uncrosslinked case of Tizanidine hydrochloride loading. No loading was achieved in the case of Fluconazole, whereas both Tizanidine hydrochloride and Gatifloxacin are observed of being capable of being loaded by nanoprecipitation. Tizanidine hydrochloride-loaded, blank and Gatifloxacin-loaded nanoparticles yielded, under crosslinked condition, 59.3, 23.1 and 10.6% of the used dried mass. The crosslinked Tizanidine hydrochloride-loaded particles showed the loading efficiency of 13.8%, which was decreased to 1.1% without crosslinking. A crosslinker such as glutaraldehyde is indispensable to enhance the Tizanidine hydrochloride-loading efficiency. To the contrary, the Gatifloxacin-loading efficiency for crosslinked ones was lower by a factor of 2-3 times than that for uncrosslinked ones. This is due to the carboxylic groups of Gatifloxacin and the aldehyde groups of glutaraldehyde competing with each other during the crosslinking process, to react with the amino groups of gelatin molecules. The loading efficiency of gelatin nanoparticles reported by other investigators greatly varies. Nevertheless, the loading efficiency reported by us is in good agreement with the drug-loading data of gelatin nanoparticles reported by other investigators. The 80% of loaded Tizanidine hydrochloride was released around 15 h after start-up of the release experiment, while the 20% of loaded Gatifloxacin was released more rapidly, as free Gatifloxacin, than the loaded Tizanidine hydrochloride and it showed the trend of sustained slow release during the remaining period of its release experiment. Furthermore, the result of comparative FT-IR analysis is consistent to that of the corresponding drug release study."}

Interestingly, cardiac arrhythmias and QT interval prolongation have been reported with tizanidine. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of tizanidine on cardiac ventricular repolarization. METHODS: (1) Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments: HERG- or KCNQ1+KCNE1-transfected cells were exposed to tizanidine 0.1-100 \u00b5mol/L (n = 29 cells, total) to assess drug effect on the rapid (I(Kr)) and slow (I(Ks)) components of the delayed rectifier potassium current. (2) Langendorff retroperfusion experiments: isolated hearts from male Hartley guinea pigs (n = 6) were exposed to tizanidine 1 \u00b5mol/L to assess drug-induced prolongation of monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD(90)). (3) In vivo wireless cardiac telemetry experiments: guinea pigs (n = 6) implanted with radio transmitters were injected a single intraperitoneal (ip) dose of tizanidine 0.25 mg/kg and 24 hours electrocardiography (ECG) recordings were made. RESULTS: (1) Patch-clamp experiments revealed an estimated IC(50) for tizanidine on I(Kr) above 100 \u00b5mol/L. Moreover, tizanidine 1 \u00b5mol/L had hardly any effect on I(Ks) (5.23% \u00b1 4.54% inhibition, n = 5 cells). (2) While pacing the hearts at stimulation cycle lengths of 200 or 250 ms, tizanidine 1 \u00b5mol/L prolonged MAPD(90) by 8.22 \u00b1 2.03 (6.7%) and 11.70 \u00b1 3.08 ms (8.5%), respectively (both P < .05 vs baseline). (3) Tizanidine 0.25 mg/kg ip caused a maximal 11.93 \u00b1 1.49 ms prolongation of corrected QT interval (QTc), 90 minutes after injection. CONCLUSION: Tizanidine prolongs the QT interval by blocking I(Kr). Patients could be at risk of cardiac proarrhythmia during impaired drug elimination, such as in case of CYP1A2 inhibition during drug interactions."}

{"keyword": "Tizanidine", "texts": "The noradrenergic system is an important neurotransmission system implicated in the occurrence of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and anxiety leading to relapse during abstinence from alcohol usage. Tizanidine can play a role in alcohol withdrawal since it interferes with the noradrenergic system neurotransmission. Many noradrenergic system inhibitors in the central nervous system have proven their efficacy in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Imidazoline receptors have been also implicated in the pathophysiology of addiction. Tizanidine is an \u03b12-adrenoreceptor agonist that inhibits noradrenaline release and binds to imidazoline receptors. It is used as an antispastic agent due to its central action on noradrenergic system. Although Tizanidine has been tested as a treatment for opioid withdrawal it has not been tried in alcohol withdrawal yet. A theoretical rationale supports the fact that it can be an efficient treatment for the alcohol withdrawal syndrome as well as for the prevention of relapses."}

Various nanoparticle (NPs) formulations of PLA and PLGA loaded with CLH were prepared by solvent evaporation method varying drug: polymer concentration (1:20, 1:10 and 1:5) and characterised (size, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, scanning electron microscope, differential scanning calorimetry [DSC] and Fourier transform infrared [FTIR] studies).

NP formulations demonstrated a significant controlled release profile extended up to 144 h (both CLH-PLA and CLH-PLGA). The thermal behaviour (DSC) studies confirmed the molecular dispersion of the drug within the system. The FTIR studies revealed the intactness as well as unaltered structure of drug. The CLH-PLA NPs showed enhanced antimicrobial activity against two pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus.

Thirteen patients with a history of \"refractory\" periodontitis were thoroughly scaled and monitored by repeated attachment level measurements for the presence of active destructive periodontitis. Disease activity was defined as a 3-mm loss in attachment from baseline measurements or the occurrence of a periodontal abscess. When active disease was detected, each patient was scaled again and placed on Clindamycin hydrochloride 150 mg qid for 7 days. Following the adjunctive use of Clindamycin in combination with scaling, the incidence of gingival sites demonstrating active disease in the group of 13 patients decreased from an annual rate of 10.7 to 0.5%. Each patient demonstrated a decreased incidence of active sites per unit of time. Clinical parameters such as probing depth, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration showed dramatic improvement at 12 months after Clindamycin therapy. The percentage of pockets with probing depths greater than 6 mm, 4 to 6 mm and 1 to 3 mm changed from 11 to 2%, 38 to 24% and 51 to 74% respectively, following Clindamycin therapy as compared to scaling alone. The percentage of sites bleeding on probing decreased from 33% after scaling alone to 8% following Clindamycin and scaling. Gingival redness decreased from 36 to 1% of sites. Suppuration also decreased from 8% of buccal or lingual surfaces after scaling alone to 1% of surfaces following scaling and Clindamycin. Clindamycin treatment resulted in a significant change in the microbial flora as demonstrated by darkfield microscopy. Prior to Clindamycin therapy, active sites averaged 35% spirochetes, 23% motile rods, 38% nonmotile rods and 4% coccoid cells.

Oxygen delivery agents such as oxygen-saturated perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions and lipid oxygen microbubbles have been employed to supply oxygen to hypoxic tumors with ultrasound activation. Such oxygen delivery systems are still associated with several drawbacks, including premature oxygen release and the dependence of external stimuli. To address these limitations, we developed oxygen nanobubbles that were enclosed by the acetalated dextran polymer shells for spontaneous oxygeneration in response to a minor pH drop in the tumor microenvironment. The acetalated dextran polymer shell serves as a robust barrier against gas dissolution in the circulating blood to retain the majority of the oxygen payload, and its pH-responsive property enables an abrupt burst release of oxygen in the mild acidic tumor microenvironment. The acetalated dextran oxygen nanobubbles exhibited excellent stability and biocompatibility. In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the pH-responsive oxygen release. The external stimuli-free supply of oxygen by the acetalated dextran oxygen nanobubbles was evaluated on CNE2 tumor-bearing mice, and the intratumoral oxygen level increased by 6-fold after the administration of the oxygen nanobubbles, manifesting that our pH-responsive oxygen nanobubbles hold great potential as a potent oxygen delivery agent to overcome the hypoxia-induced resistance."}

Oxygen surface exchange kinetics is considered in the framework of two-step models including two consecutive stages: dissociative adsorption of oxygen and incorporation of oxygen adatoms into the crystal lattice. The rates of oxygen heterogeneous exchange (rH) as well as the rates of dissociative adsorption (ra) and oxygen incorporation (ri) have been calculated. The applicability of the two-step model is discussed based on the concept of a novel two-step mechanism with distributed rates of dissociative adsorption and incorporation of oxygen. It is shown that the two-step model can be applicable for the description of oxygen exchange kinetics in Pr1.75Sr0.25Ni0.75Co0.25O4\u00b1\u03b4 only at temperatures below 750 \u00b0C. Above this temperature, only the statistical model with distributed rates can be used. At low temperatures (<750 \u00b0C), the oxygen incorporation rate is found to be smaller than the rate of oxygen dissociative adsorption. Thus, under these experimental conditions the stage of oxygen incorporation is considered to be rate-determining. When increasing the temperature, the difference between ra and ri decreases and the stages become competing. The oxygen isotope exchange kinetic profiles obtained using the IE GPE method are found to be complicated and include a surface exchange stage as well as at least two diffusion relaxation processes. The reasons for the existence of these two processes are discussed."}

{"keyword": "Oxygen", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:It is well known that supplemental oxygen can increase aerobic power output during high-intensity and/or maximal efforts at moderate altitude, yet the effects on self-selected work rate during lower-intensity, submaximal exercise are unknown. We reasoned that if the degree of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) influences teleoanticipatory regulation of power output, supplemental oxygen given at moderate altitude would increase average power output during exercise performed at self-selected work rates corresponding to RPE 9 (very light) and 13 (somewhat hard). METHODS:Twenty-three subjects (17 males, 6 females) completed one familiarization [fraction of inspired O2 (FIO2) = 0.209] and two blinded, experimental trials (FIO2 = 0.209 and FIO2 = 0.267). In each trial, subjects self-regulated their work rate on a cycle ergometer to maintain RPE 9 for 5 min and RPE 13 for 10 min, before performing an incremental step test to exhaustion (25 W\u00b7min). Oxygen consumption (V\u02d9O2) and SaO2 via pulse oximetry (SpO2) were continuously monitored. Subjects were asked to guess the experimental condition after each stage of the protocol. RESULTS:Supplemental oxygen increased SpO2 throughout exercise (~4%; P < 0.001) and was associated with greater peak power output (4% \u00b1 4%; P < 0.001) and V\u02d9O2 (5% \u00b1 10%; P = 0.010) during the incremental test, but did not increase average power output selected during exercise at RPE 9 (P = 0.235) or 13 (P = 0.992). Subjects were unable to perceive the difference in FIO2 at any stage (P > 0.14). CONCLUSIONS:Small increases in inspired oxygen concentration at moderate altitude are imperceptible and do not appear to influence selection of submaximal work rates at RPE \u2264 13."}

METHODS:41 patients with VKH disease (82 eyes) and 12 healthy subjects (24 eyes) matched in age and gender were prospectively evaluated. Retinal oxygen saturation and vessel calibre were measured with a non-invasive spectrophotometric retinal oximeter (Oxymap T1). RESULTS:In healthy controls, mean arteriolar oxygen saturation (%) was 93.8\u00b15.9\u2009and venular saturation was 60.1\u00b15.8. In acute VKH uveitic phase associated with exudative retinal detachment (n=12), arteriolar and venular oxygen saturation values were 104.7\u00b17.8\u2009and 67.9\u00b17.7, respectively, and both are significantly higher than the healthy group (p<0.001; p=0.001, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS:Retinal oxygen metabolism is altered in uveitis associated with VKH disease. Oxygen saturation profile is abnormal in acute uveitic phase of the disease and returns to normal in those who recover with normal fundus appearance, but not in eyes that suffer permanent anatomical damage with 'sunset glow fundus' and chorioretinal atrophy.

Therefore, the structure of egg membranes could affect the rate at which embryos obtain oxygen from their surroundings. Published field data indicate that oxygen stress experienced by salmonid eggs can vary widely among populations. Therefore, if membrane architecture influences diffusion rate to the embryo, selection for more permeable membranes could occur in oxygen-stressed environments. Using electron microscopy, the membrane structure of eggs obtained from five UK Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations is described. Membrane thickness, porosity and permeability to dissolved oxygen varied among populations. Furthermore, comparison of membranes of eggs that survived laboratory controlled low-oxygen conditions compared to those that died suggested that ova with less permeable membranes were more susceptible to hypoxia-induced mortality. In addition, membrane porosity was lower than previously reported indicating that oxygen requirements during incubation have been underestimated, so models such as the mass transfer theory that predict incubation success could currently overestimate ova survival. Variation in egg membrane structure influences low oxygen tolerance of Atlantic salmon embryos and could represent adaptation to low oxygen stress. Consequently, stock enhancement techniques such as supportive breeding that relieve incubation stress could erode structural adaptations."}

{"keyword": "Oxygen", "texts": "Oxygen transfer is a key process determining the energy use of a biological wastewater treatment process. In this research, we investigated the effect of sludge morphology, especially the role of filamentous microorganisms, on oxygen transfer using bench-scale complete-mix activated sludge reactors with solids retention times (SRTs) of 10-, 20-, and 40-days, respectively. Results indicated 5%-10% reduced aeration need in the 40-day SRT reactor, compared with 10- and 20-day SRT reactors to maintain the same dissolved oxygen level, due to the improvement in sludge settleability and oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). Filamentous microorganisms adversely impacted OTE via an increase in apparent viscosity of the mixed liquor, which resulted in an increase in the air bubble size and liquid film thickness and, therefore, limited oxygen transfer at the air-liquid boundary. A statistical analysis also confirmed that the mixed liquor viscosity is a statistically significant parameter links to OTE. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Filamentous organisms reduce oxygen transfer via increasing mixed liquor viscosity, which increases air bubble size and liquid film thickness at the air-liquid boundary. Increasing solids retention time reduces filament density. As a result, very long solids retention time promotes oxygen transfer."}

As such, the ease with which oxygen vacancies form often determines the application potential of these materials in many technological fields. However, little is known about the role of oxygen vacancies in nanosized materials. In this work we compute the energies to create oxygen vacancies in highly stable nanoclusters of (TiO2)N, (SiO2)N, and mixed (TixSi1-xO2)N for sizes between N = 2 and N = 24 units. Contrary to the results for bulk and surfaces, we predict that removing an oxygen atom from global minima silica clusters is energetically more favorable than from the respective titania species. This unexpected chemical behavior is clearly linked to the inherent presence of terminal unsaturated oxygens at these nanoscale systems. In order to fully characterize our findings, we provide an extensive set of descriptors (oxygen vacancy formation energy, electron localization, density of states, relaxation energy, and geometry) that can be used to compare our results with those for other compositions and sizes. Our results will help in the search of novel nanomaterials for technological and scientific applications such as heterogeneous catalysis, electronics, and cluster chemistry."}

To assess their potential as physiologically relevant in vitro models, we determined a working window in which quarter power allometric scaling as well as a minimum threshold oxygen concentration is maintained during organoid growth. Oxygen consumption and diffusion in organoids at different stages of growth were computed using three-dimensional finite element models. The results show that it is impossible to establish mature organoids free of necrotic cores using current protocols. However, micro-fluidic oxygen delivery methods can be designed to ensure that oxygen levels are above a minimum viable threshold throughout the constructs and that they follow physiological metabolic scaling laws. The results provide new insights into the significance of allometric scaling in systems not equipped with a resource-supplying network. They may also be used to guide the experimental set up and design of more predictive and physiologically-relevant in vitro models, providing an effective alternative to animals in research."}

Oxygen is delivered to the cultures through a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane at the bottom of the wells, with microfabricated PDMS pillars to control oxygen delivery. The plates receive 3% oxygen from below and 0% oxygen at the top surface of the media, providing a gradient of 3% to 0% oxygen. We compared growth and transcriptional profiles for cancer cells grown in Matrigel in the bioreactor, 3D cultures grown in 21% oxygen, and cells grown in a standard hypoxia chamber at 3% oxygen. Additionally, we compared gene expression of conventional 2D monolayer culture and 3D Matrigel culture in 21% oxygen. We conclude that controlled oxygen delivery may provide a more physiologically relevant 3D system."}

From the changes of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and PSII activity, it was proved that the electron transport, which occurred initially at the electron donor side of OEC, was disturbed by CTAC. Moreover, a significant decrease of the oxygen evolution rate in OEC (40.95%) while an increase of ROS (50.50%) was obtained after the exposure to 0.6\u202fmg/L CTAC compared to the control (without CTAC), confirming that more oxygen transferred to ROS under the stress. Furthermore, the increased ROS in chloroplast and the structural destruction in thylakoid membrane were observed, respectively. These results proved that oxidative damage mechanism in PSII-OEC is mainly through the reduction of oxygen evolution and the production of excessive ROS, thus leading to the destruction of OEC performance and chloroplast structure."}

OBJECTIVES:To identify patient characteristics at the time of oxygen initiation associated with its adherence. METHODS:We conducted a secondary analysis of data from 359 COPD participants assigned to oxygen in the Long-term Oxygen Treatment Trial. Participants were prescribed continuous (n\u202f=\u202f214) or intermittent (n\u202f=\u202f145) oxygen based on desaturation patterns at study entry. At the time of initial prescription, participants rated their perceived readiness, confidence, and importance to use oxygen on a 0-10 scale (0\u202f=\u202fnot at all, 10\u202f=\u202fvery much). During follow-up, they self-reported average hours per day of use (adherence). Adherence was averaged over short-term (0-30 days), medium-term (months 9-12), and long-term (month 13 to last follow-up) intervals. Multivariable logistic regression models explored characteristics associated with high adherence (\u226516\u202fh/day [continuous] or \u22658\u202fh/day [intermittent]) during each time interval. RESULTS:Participant readiness, confidence, and importance at the time of oxygen initiation were associated with high short- and medium-term adherence. For each unit increase in baseline readiness, the odds of high short-term adherence increased by 21% (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.40) and 94% (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.45-2.59) in the continuous and intermittent groups, respectively. In both groups, high adherence in the medium-term was associated with high adherence in the long-term (continuous, OR 12.49, 95% CI 4.90-31.79; intermittent, OR 38.08, 95% CI 6.96-208.20). CONCLUSIONS:Readiness, confidence, and importance to use LTOT at initiation, and early high adherence, are significantly associated with long-term oxygen adherence."}

{"keyword": "Oxygen", "texts": "PURPOSE:Oxygen permeability or transmissibility is a crucial parameter for contact lenses to ensure that extended wear will not induce corneal hypoxia. This work tests a new method of using the oxidation of cysteamine, an oxygen-sensitive chemical, to quantify the oxygen transmissibility of current commercial contact lenses and contact lenses loaded with vitamin E. METHODS:3D printing was used to modify eye drop bottles and quartz cuvettes to create systems that allowed insertion of a contact lens in between the cysteamine solution and air. Both systems were exposed to atmospheric conditions where the only path of entry for oxygen was through the contact lens. The entering oxygen reacted with cysteamine, and the rate of cysteamine oxidation was measured using UV-vis spectrophotometry. The rate was then stoichiometrically related to oxygen transmissibility. RESULTS:The eye drop method predicted transmissibility values within 9% of established, commercial values. The cuvette method predicted values within 10% of established values for silicone hydrogel lenses without any correction factor and within 11% for poly-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate lenses after correcting for oxygen entering the system. Incorporation of 20% (w/w) vitamin E into Acuvue\u00ae Oasys\u00ae lenses did not have a significant impact on the oxygen transmissibility. CONCLUSIONS:Both methods presented in this work can reliably measure oxygen transmissibility of contacts lenses or other materials. Further improvements in manufacturing could lead to improved accuracy and reliability, allowing wider use of this method for quantifying the oxygen transport in contact lenses."}

There is a strong need to precisely control and modulate oxygen tension in cell culture systems in order to more accurately model the physiology and pathophysiology observed in vivo. The objective of this paper was to develop a simple, yet effective strategy for local control of oxygen tension in microfluidic cell cultures. Our strategy relied on fabrication of microfluidic devices using oxygen-permeable and impermeable materials. This composite device was designed so as to incorporate regions of gas permeability into the roof of the cell culture chamber and was outfitted with a reservoir for the oxygen-consuming chemical pyrogallol. When assembled and filled with pyrogallol, this device allowed oxygen depletion to occur within a specific region of the microfluidic culture chamber. The geometry and dimensions of the hypoxic region inside a microfluidic chamber were controlled by features fabricated into the oxygen-impermeable layer. Oxygen tension as low as 0.5% could be achieved using this strategy. To prove the utility of this device, we demonstrated that hypoxia induced anaerobic metabolism in a group of liver cancer cells, and that neighboring cancer cells residing under normoxic conditions upregulated the expression of transporters for taking up lactate - a product of anaerobic respiration. The microfluidic devices described here may be broadly applicable for mimicking multiple physiological scenarios where oxygen tension varies on the length scale of tens of micrometers including the cancer microenvironment, liver zonation, and luminal microenvironment of the gut."}

RECENT FINDINGS:Oxygen sensing in osteocytes can confer a high bone mass phenotype in murine models; common and unique targets of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 and lineage-specific deletion of oxygen sensing machinery suggest differentia utilization and requirement of HIF-\u03b1 proteins in the differentiation from mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblast to osteocyte; oxygen-dependent but HIF-\u03b1-independent signaling may contribute to observed skeletal phenotypes. Manipulating oxygen sensing machinery in osteogenic cells influences skeletal phenotype through angiogenesis-dependent and angiogenesis-independent pathways and involves HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, or both proteins. Clinically, an FDA-approved iron chelator promotes angiogenesis and osteogenesis, thereby enhancing the rate of fracture repair."}

{"keyword": "Oxygen", "texts": "Reversible high-voltage redox chemistry is an essential component of many electrochemical technologies, from (electro)catalysts to lithium-ion batteries. Oxygen-anion redox has garnered intense interest for such applications, particularly lithium-ion batteries, as it offers substantial redox capacity at more than 4\u2009V versus Li/Li+ in a variety of oxide materials. However, oxidation of oxygen is almost universally correlated with irreversible local structural transformations, voltage hysteresis and voltage fade, which currently preclude its widespread use. By comprehensively studying the Li2-xIr1-ySnyO3 model system, which exhibits tunable oxidation state and structural evolution with y upon cycling, we reveal that this structure-redox coupling arises from the local stabilization of short approximately 1.8\u2009\u00c5 metal-oxygen \u03c0 bonds and approximately 1.4\u2009\u00c5 O-O dimers during oxygen redox, which occurs in Li2-xIr1-ySnyO3 through ligand-to-metal charge transfer. Crucially, formation of these oxidized oxygen species necessitates the decoordination of oxygen to a single covalent bonding partner through formation of vacancies at neighbouring cation sites, driving cation disorder. These insights establish a point-defect explanation for why anion redox often occurs alongside local structural disordering and voltage hysteresis during cycling. Our findings offer an explanation for the unique electrochemical properties of lithium-rich layered oxides, with implications generally for the design of materials employing oxygen redox chemistry."}

This study was designed to further explore whether delivering dry oxygen instead of bubble-moistened oxygen had an impact on discomfort of ICU patients. METHODS:This randomized multicenter non-inferiority open trial included patients admitted in intensive care unit and receiving oxygen. Any patient receiving non-humidified oxygen (between 0 and 15\u00a0L/min) for less than 2\u00a0h could participate in the study. Randomization was stratified based on the flow rate at inclusion (less or more than 4 L/min). Discomfort was assessed 6-8 and 24\u00a0h after inclusion using a dedicated 15-item scale (quoted from 0 to 150). RESULTS:Three hundred and fifty-four ICU patients receiving non-humidified oxygen were randomized either in the humidified (HO) (n\u2009=\u2009172), using bubble humidifiers, or in the non-humidified (NHO) (n\u2009=\u2009182) arms. In modified intention-to-treat analysis at H6-H8, the 15-item score was 26.6\u2009\u00b1\u200919.4 and 29.8\u2009\u00b1\u200923.4 in the HO and NHO groups, respectively. The absolute difference between scores in both groups was 3.2 [90% CI 0.0; +\u00a06.5] for a non-inferiority margin of 5.3, meaning that the non-inferiority analysis was not conclusive. This was also true for the subgroups of patients receiving either less or more than 4\u00a0L/min of oxygen. At H24, using NHO was not inferior compared to HO in the general population and in the subgroup of patients receiving 4\u00a0L/min or less of oxygen. However, for patients receiving more than 4\u00a0L/min, a post hoc superiority analysis suggested that patients receiving dry oxygen were less comfortable. CONCLUSIONS:Oxygen therapy-related discomfort was low. Dry oxygen could not be demonstrated as non-inferior compared to bubble-moistened oxygen after 6-8\u00a0h of oxygen administration. At 24\u00a0h, dry oxygen was non-inferior compared to bubble-humidified oxygen for flows below 4\u00a0L/min."}

The oxygen mass transfer is therefore necessary to enhance. This work aimed to develop the gas-liquid reactor, named Modified Airlift Reactor (MALR) for improving the oxygen transfer efficiency in terms of internal configurations and aeration parameters by equipping a vertical baffle for creating liquid circulation phenomena, and installing slanted baffles in the reactor riser to extend air-bubbles retention time and to improve their distributions. Since extremum conditions of the investigated factors may inefficient, optimum levels are required to identify. 2k factorial and response surface design of Design of Experiment (DOE) methodology were applied to optimize these complex variables in terms of overall liquid mass transfer coefficient (KLa) of clean water. As a result, the main effective factors of MALR with their optimum value are amount of baffles (Nb \u223c 3 baffles), baffle angle (\u03b1 \u223c 50\u00b0), position of base area (Yr \u223c 10\u2005cm), open space on baffle (As \u223c 90\u2005cm2), and gas flow (Qg). Increasing Qg resulted better KLa for the studied ranges (2-18 LPM). At the optimum condition, the improvement of MALR in terms of KLa coefficient was increased up to 97% and 28% compared to the regular bubble column and airlift reactor, respectively, at a certain gas flow without any extra energy. The correlation models of KLa coefficient with significant variables and power consumption were constructed for future estimation purposes."}

{"keyword": "Oxygen", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Supplemental oxygen is a key element of emergency treatment algorithms. However, in the operational environment, oxygen supply poses a challenge. The lack of high-quality evidence alongside emerging technologies provides the opportunity to challenge current guidelines. The aim of this review was to appraise the evidence for the administration of oxygen in emergency patients and give recommendations for its use in clinical practice. METHODS:A critical review of the literature was undertaken to determine the evidence for emergency supplemental oxygen use. RESULTS:Based on interpretation of the limited available evidence, five key recommendations are made: pulse oximetry should be continuous and initiated as early as possible; oxygen should be available to all trauma and medical patients in the forward operating environment; if peripheral oxygen saturations (SpO2) are greater than or equal to 92%, supplemental oxygen is not routinely required; if SpO2 is less than 92%, supplemental oxygen should be titrated to achieve an SpO2 of greater than 92%; and if flow rates of greater than 5 L/min are required, then urgent evacuation and critical care support should be requested. CONCLUSION:Oxygen is not universally required for all patients. Current guidelines aim to prevent hypoxia but with potentially conservative limits. Oxygen should be administered to maintain SpO2 at 92% or above. New areas for research, highlighted in this review, may provide a future approach for oxygen use from point of injury to definitive care."}

Median TTDs were shorter in the Virtuo than in the 3D system for all isolates (11.5 hours [N=305] vs 11.8 hours [N=318], P<0.001), Staphylococcus aureus (N=38; 14.3 hours vs 16.0 hours, P=0.021), and Escherichia coli (N=117; 10.4 hours vs 11.0 hours, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS:The Virtuo has the potential to detect pathogens early in all bottle types. This might improve the prognosis of sepsis by allowing for implementation of expeditious management."}

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "OBJECTIVES:Excessive alerts are a common concern associated with clinical decision support systems that monitor drug-drug interactions (DDIs). To reduce the number of low-value interruptive DDI alerts at our hospital, we implemented an iterative, multidimensional quality improvement effort, which included an interdisciplinary advisory group, alert metrics, and measurement of perceived clinical value. METHODS:Alert data analysis indicated that DDIs were the most common interruptive medication alert. An interdisciplinary alert advisory group was formed to provide expert advice and oversight for alert refinement and ongoing review of alert data. Alert data were categorized into drug classes and analyzed to identify DDI alerts for refinement. Refinement strategies included alert suppression and modification of alerts to be contextually aware. RESULTS:On the basis of historical analysis of classified DDI alerts, 26 alert refinements were implemented, representing 47% of all alerts. Alert refinement efforts resulted in the following substantial decreases in the number of interruptive DDI alerts: 40% for all clinicians (22.9-14 per 100 orders) and as high as 82% for attending physicians (6.5-1.2 per 100 orders). Two patient safety events related to alert refinements were reported during the project period. CONCLUSIONS:Our quality improvement effort refined 47% of all DDI alerts that were firing during historical analysis, significantly reduced the number of DDI alerts in a 54-week period, and established a model for sustained alert refinements."}

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "On January 13, 2018, at 8:07 a.m. Hawaii Standard Time, an errant emergency alert was sent to persons in Hawaii. An employee at the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (EMA) sent the errant alert via the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system and the Emergency Alert System (EAS) during a ballistic missile preparedness drill, advising persons to seek shelter from an incoming ballistic missile. WEA delivers location-based warnings to wireless carrier systems, and EAS sends alerts via television and radio (1). After 38 minutes, at 8:45 a.m., Hawaii EMA retracted the alert via WEA and EAS (2). To understand the impact of the alert, social media responses to the errant message were analyzed. Data were extracted from Twitter* using a Boolean search for tweets (Twitter postings) posted on January 13 regarding the false alert. Tweets were analyzed during two 38-minute periods: 1) early (8:07-8:45 a.m.), the elapsed time the errant alert circulated until the correction was issued and 2) late (8:46-9:24 a.m.), the same amount of elapsed time after issuance of the correction. A total of 5,880 tweets during the early period and 8,650 tweets during the late period met the search criteria. Four themes emerged during the early period: information processing, information sharing, authentication, and emotional reaction. During the late period, information sharing and emotional reaction themes persisted; denunciation, insufficient knowledge to act, and mistrust of authority also emerged as themes. Understanding public interpretation, sharing, and reaction to social media messages related to emergencies can inform development and dissemination of accurate public health messages to save lives during a crisis."}

Automated blood culture systems have shown promise as alternatives to the manual USP<71> compendial method, but current published data are limited by small organism test sets, particularly for molds. In 2015, failure of the Bactec FX system to detect mold contamination in two products prompted us to evaluate three test systems (compendial USP<71>, Bactec FX, and BacT/Alert Dual-T) over seven different culture combinations, using 118 challenge organisms representative of the NIH current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) environment. At <96\u2009h and <144\u2009h for bacterial and fungal detection, respectively, the compendial USP<71> method significantly outperformed the Bactec FX system (84.7% versus 64.4%; P\u2009=\u20090.0006) but not the BacT/Alert system at 32.5\u00b0C (78.8%; P\u2009=\u20090.3116). Extended incubation to 360\u2009h with terminal visual inspection improved sensitivity, without a significant difference between compendial USP<71> and BacT/Alert testing (95.7% versus 89.0%; P\u2009=\u20090.0860); both systems were better than the Bactec FX system (71.2%; P\u2009<\u20090.0001 and P\u2009=\u20090.0003, respectively). The Bactec FX and BacT/Alert systems performed equivalently for 30 isolates derived from clinical bloodstream infections, confirming system optimization for clinical organisms rather than environmental contaminants. Paired Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates were always positive for fungi within the acceptable time frame. This study shows that the Bactec FX system is suboptimal for product sterility testing, and it provides strong data to support the use of BacT/Alert testing at 32.5\u00b0C paired with a supplemental SDA plate as an acceptable alternative to the compendial USP<71> method for product sterility testing."}

The Nurses' Knowledge of High-Alert Medication scale (NKHAM) is a tool available to evaluate the knowledge of nurses in practice about this issue. AIM:This pilot study aimed to measure the reliability and known-groups validity of the Brazilian version of the NKHAM. METHODS:This pilot psychometric study was carried out at the Faculty of Nursing and University Hospital of the University of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Forty nursing students and 44 registered nurses working in complex clinical or surgical settings completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and the Brazilian version of the NKHAM. The Kuder-Richardson 20 (KR-20) coefficient and Mann-Whitney test were used to establish reliability and known-groups validity. A significance level of \u2264 0.05 was adopted for all the analyses. RESULTS:Analyses demonstrated preliminary acceptable reliability scores of 0.55 and 0.60 in domains A and B of NKHAM, respectively. A significant difference was found between the nursing students' and the registered nurses' knowledge of high-alert medications, demonstrating the scale's ability to discriminate between the two groups. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Although this is pilot study, results suggest that the Brazilian version of the NKHAM might be a reliable and valid tool to measure nurses' knowledge of high-alert medications."}

Pharmacists encounter the highest number of medication alerts and likely have developed behaviors to cope with alerting inefficiencies. The study objective was to better understand alert override behavior relating to a motivational construct framework. Methods. Mixed-methods study of 10 pharmacists (567 verifications) with eye-tracking observations and retrospective think aloud interviews. Results. Pharmacists spent on average 14 seconds longer verifying orders with alerts than orders without alerts (p<0.001). Verification occurred before alerts were triggered, and no order changes occurred after alerts. Pharmacists reported 62% of alerts as unhelpful and 21% as frustrating. Alert interactions took on average 3.9 seconds. Discussion. Pharmacists anticipate alerts by making appropriate checks and changes before alert prompts. Medication alerts seem to be useful. However, the observed pharmacists' behavior suggests changes in the alert context are needed to match cognition."}

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "AbstractBackgroundAccurate prediction of the onset of increased influenza activity in a healthcare setting can allow for optimal use of enhanced prevention activities. The ALERT (Above Local Elevated Respiratory Illness Threshold) algorithm, described by Reich et al. (2015), utilizes historical weekly case counts of laboratory-confirmed influenza infections to set a trigger point of cases/week that anticipates elevated disease incidence. This can then be used in real-time, during subsequent influenza seasons, for initiation of enhanced prevention, including masking by nonvaccinated healthcare workers.MethodsHistorical data collected from UnityPoint Health-Des Moines (3-hospital, 800-bed system), between 2011 and 2014, was analyzed using the ALERT method (Reich et al. 2015) to set a threshold number of diagnosed influenza cases per week to predict the start of the influenza season. Each following year the threshold was re-analyzed, adding the most recent year\u2019s data to the historical data set. Our goal was to capture at least 80% of influenza cases within our \u201cALERT period,\u201d without prolonging the duration of heightened prevention efforts.ResultsFor the initial year of real-time application (2015\u20132016), the threshold was defined as seven cases. In subsequent years, the threshold was 5. Compared with the 3 years prior, use of the ALERT method resulted in more accurate and consistent identification of the influenza season, including anticipating the increase in cases and defining the total duration of the season.Threshold TriggerOnset Date of Enhanced PreventionTotal Cases per SeasonPercent of Cases Captured During AlertDuration of Alert Period (Weeks)Influenza Season Metrics\u20032012\u20132013N/ANovember 15, 201272599%22\u20032013\u20132014N/ADecember 30, 201325577%9\u20032014\u20132015N/ADecember 11, 201477373%19ALERT Trigger Initiated\u20032015\u201320167February 22, 201625087%13\u20032016\u201320175January 3, 201779195%17\u20032017\u20132018a5December 11, 20171,44598%20 aAs of April 28, 2018.ConclusionThe ALERT method utilizes health system specific historical data to more precisely define the period of high influenza incidence allowing for focused utilization of enhanced measures to prevent transmission.

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Early awareness and alert systems have been established in many countries but evidence on their ability to accurately prioritize new medicines (for early assessment) is limited. OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to assess whether the Swedish Early Awareness and Alert System identified and prioritized (i.e., produced early assessment reports for) new medicines that would go on to have substantial economic impact. METHODS:We adapted a study design commonly used in the assessment of diagnostic test accuracy. The prioritization made by the Swedish Early Awareness and Alert System prior to marketing authorization comprised the index test and the national drug sales data in the second year post-authorization served as the reference standard. All initial marketing authorization applications for medicinal products processed by the European Medicines Agency between 2010 and 2015 (study population) were classified using the index test and the reference standard. RESULTS:Two hundred and fifty-three new medicinal products processed by the European Medicines Agency comprised the study population. Of these, 71 were prioritized by the Swedish Early Awareness and Alert System and 21 were classified as having substantial economic impact. The sensitivity and positive predictive value were 76.2% and 22.5%, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the accuracy of prioritization, in terms of sensitivity, was 100% for antineoplastic/immunomodulating agents. CONCLUSIONS:The Swedish Early Awareness and Alert System identified all new medicines that would go on to have substantial economic impact and prioritized most of these medicines. Our findings provide reassurance to decision makers who rely on the outputs of the Swedish Early Awareness and Alert System to keep informed about new medicines. Moreover, this study also provides valuable insights to stakeholders willing to establish or evaluate their own early awareness and alert activities and systems."}

The Alert Program, a program that uses sensorimotor strategies for self-regulation in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, had not been trialled with children with tic disorders. Ten children with tic disorder were assessed using the Dunn Sensory Profile 2 (SP2), the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) and the Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ). Participants attended three 60-90-minute appointments with an occupational therapist and clinical psychologist for implementation of the adapted Alert Program. The YGTSS showed tic reduction in all participants. The total YGTSS pre-intervention mean score of 46.5 improved to 17.7 post-therapy. Five participants reported no impairment post-therapy. PTQ scores reduced in nine participants. On the SP2, 30% of participants scored as having sensory sensitivities that impaired daily function.

Unlike the Asian Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) present in Spain since 2004, there has been no record of Ae. japonicus in the country until now. RESULTS:Here, we report the first detection of Ae. japonicus in Spain, at its southernmost location in Europe. This finding was triggered by the citizen science platform Mosquito Alert. In June 2018, a citizen sent a report via the Mosquito Alert app from the municipality of Siero in the Asturias region (NW Spain) containing pictures of a female mosquito compatible with Ae. japonicus. Further information was requested from the participant, who subsequently provided several larvae and adults that could be classified as Ae. japonicus. In July, a field mission confirmed its presence at the original site and in several locations up to 9 km away, suggesting a long-time establishment. The strong media impact in Asturias derived from the discovery raised local participation in the Mosquito Alert project, resulting in further evidence from surrounding areas. CONCLUSIONS:Whilst in the laboratory Ae. japonicus is a competent vector for several mosquito-borne pathogens, to date only West Nile virus is a concern based on field evidence. Nonetheless, this virus has yet not been detected in Asturias so the vectorial risk is currently considered low. The opportunity and effectiveness of combining citizen-sourced data to traditional surveillance methods are discussed."}

Dogs have been reported as being sensitive to epileptic episodes in their owners, alerting before and/or responding during or after a seizure, with or without specific training. The purpose of this review is to present a comprehensive overview of the scientific research on seizure-alert/response dogs for people with epilepsy. We aimed to identify the existing scientific literature on the topic, describe the characteristics of seizure-alert/response dogs, and evaluate the state of the evidence base and outcomes. Out of 28 studies published in peer-reviewed journals dealing with this topic, only 5 (one prospective study and four self-reported questionnaires) qualified for inclusion according to PRISMA guidelines. Reported times of alert before seizure varied widely among dogs (with a range from 10 seconds to 5 hours) but seemed to be reliable (accuracy from \u226570% to 85% according to owner reports). Alerting behaviors were generally described as attention-getting. The alert applied to many seizure types. Dogs mentioned as being seizure-alert dogs varied in size and breed. Training methods differed between service animal programs, partially relying on hypothesized cues used by dogs (e.g., variations in behavior, scent, heart rate). Most studies indicated an increase in quality of life and a reduction in the seizure frequency when living with a dog demonstrating seizure-related behavior. However, the level of methodological rigor was generally poor. In conclusion, scientific data are still too scarce and preliminary to reach any definitive conclusion regarding the success of dogs in alerting for an impending seizure, the cues on which this ability may be based, the best type of dog, and associated training. While these preliminary data suggest that this is a promising topic, further research is needed."}
{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "AbstractWith increasing prevalence of dementia, is growing demand for strategies to help find older adults who get lost due to memory impairment. The Community Area Silver Alert Program (C-ASAP) is an alert system that invites community members to search for missing seniors. The impact of the release of private information for the purpose of finding a missing vulnerable older person remains unexplored. The objective was to identify and describe the ethical and legal issues associated with release of personal information in the C-ASAP system. Four focus groups were convened across three Canadian provinces with stakeholders including persons with mild dementia, care partners, service providers, first responders and industry representatives. Focus groups revealed concerns about social (e.g., stigma) and physical (e.g., bodily harm) with the release of the name and photograph of the missing person, particularly given their vulnerability and the potential for the information to be used in criminal activity. However, the personal information to be released by C-ASAP is comparable with other registries. In high risk situations in which a person\u2019s life is at danger, privacy may be of less concern than in low risk situations. Consultations with relevant stakeholders are therefore necessary to ensure all privacy concerns are met. Concerns uncovered in focus groups will be used to make improvements to C-ASAP prior to its deployment in three test cities. Study findings can also be used to inform policy, and guide other alert systems and programs intended to locate missing persons with dementia."}

The efficacy of BacT/Alert system in detecting Malassezia was assessed by conventional procedures, culturing 1\u00a0ml of bottle content before incubation and by studying the survival of Malassezia spp. strains in BacT/Alert bottles. Of the 492 neonates enrolled, blood was collected by pediatric Isolator (290 patients; group I) or by BacT/Alert bottles (202 patients; group II). The survival of Malassezia furfur and Malassezia pachydermatis in BacT/Alert bottles was evaluated by culturing the inoculum suspension (from 106 to 10 colony-forming units, cfu/ml) and assessing the cfu/ml for 15 days. In total, 15 Malassezia BSIs were detected, of which six (2.1%) from both blood and CVC culture in Dixon agar (DixA) in patients belong to group I (blood collected by paediatric Isolator tube) and nine (4.4%) only from CVC culture in DixA in patients of group II (blood collected by BacT/Alert bottle). Only one patient (0.5%) from group II scored positive for M. furfur also by culturing in DixA 1\u00a0ml blood content of BacT/Alert bottle before incubation in BacT/Alert system.M. furfur population size in BacT/Alert bottles decreased during the incubation time, whereas that of M. pachydermatis increased. The BacT/Alert system detected M. pachydermatis even at very low concentration (i.e., 10 cfu/ml) but not any positive blood culture for M. furfur. For a correct diagnosis of Malassezia furfur BSI, the blood should be culture in lipid-enriched fungal medium, and the BacT/Alert system implemented by adding lipid substrates to increase the method sensibility. Finally, CVC cultures on lipid-supplemented media may be proposed as a routine procedure to diagnose the Malassezia fungemia."}

Due to the nature of the analytes and their susceptibility to various processing effects, reliability and comparability of results have posed a great challenge. In this context, the use of incurred samples as reference materials permits simulation of the effects of food processing on target analyte structure affecting analyte extractability and detectability.

BACKGROUND:The mortality surveillance system has generated monthly mortality alerts since 2007, on 122 individual diagnosis and surgical procedure groups, using routinely collected hospital administrative data for all English acute NHS hospital trusts. The CQC, the English national regulator, is notified of each alert. This study describes the findings of CQC investigations of alerting trusts. METHODS:We carried out (1) a descriptive analysis of alerts (2007-2016) and (2) an audit of CQC investigations in a subset of alerts (2011-2013). RESULTS:Between April 2007 and October 2016, 860 alerts were generated and 76% (654 alerts) were sent to trusts. Alert volumes varied over time (range: 40-101). Septicaemia (except in labour) was the most commonly alerting group (11.5% alerts sent). We reviewed CQC communications in a subset of 204 alerts from 96 trusts. The CQC investigated 75% (154/204) of alerts. In 90% of these pursued alerts, trusts returned evidence of local case note reviews (140/154). These reviews found areas of care that could be improved in 69% (106/154) of alerts. In 25% (38/154) trusts considered that identified failings in care could have impacted on patient outcomes. The CQC investigations resulted in full trust action plans in 77% (118/154) of all pursued alerts. CONCLUSION:The mortality surveillance system has generated a large number of alerts since 2007. Quality of care problems were found in 69% of alerts with CQC investigations, and one in four trusts reported that failings in care may have an impact on patient outcomes. Identifying whether mortality alerts are the most efficient means to highlight areas of substandard care will require further investigation."}

The Instrument for Evaluating Human Factors Principles in Medication-Related Decision Support Alerts (I-MeDeSA) is a tool developed in the United States to guide improvements to alert design and facilitate selection of electronic systems with superior design. In this study, we aimed to determine the reliability, ease of use and usefulness of I-MeDeSA for assessing drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in an Australian context. METHODS:Using the I-MeDeSA, three reviewers independently evaluated DDI alert interfaces of seven electronic systems used in Australia. Inter-rater reliability was assessed and reviewers met to discuss difficulties in using I-MeDeSA and the tool's usefulness. RESULTS:Inter-rater reliability was high (Krippendorff's alpha\u2009=\u20090.76), however, ambiguous wording and the inclusion of conditional items impacted ease of use. A number of items were not relevant to Australian implementations and as a result, most systems achieved an I-MeDeSA score of less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS:The I-MeDeSA proved to be reliable, but item wording and structure made application difficult. Future studies should investigate potential modifications to the I-MeDeSA to improve ease of use and increase applicability to a variety of system configurations."}

This system has provided a framework for guiding public health interventions and assessing population response and adaptation to extreme heat in greater Vancouver, but no other parts of BC were covered by HARS. The objective of this study was to identify evidence-based heat alert thresholds for the Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, and Northeast regions to facilitate the introduction of HARS across BC. This was done based on a national approach that considers high temperatures on two consecutive days and the intervening overnight low, referred to as the high-low-high approach. Daily forecast and observed air temperatures and daily mortality counts for May through September of 2004 through 2016 were obtained. For each date (dayt), dayt-2 forecasts were used to assign high temperatures for dayt and dayt+1 and the overnight low. A range of high-low-high threshold combinations was assessed for each region by finding associations with daily mortality using time-series models and other considerations. The following thresholds were established: 29-16-29 \u00b0C in the Southwest; 35-18-35 \u00b0C in the Southeast; 28-13-28 \u00b0C in the Northwest; and 29-14-29 \u00b0C in the Northeast. Heat alert thresholds for all regions in BC provide health authorities with information on dangerously hot temperature conditions and inform the activation of protective public health interventions."}

However, surgery alters peri-operative physiology, which may trigger an sBPA for noninfectious causes. This study aimed to provide early evaluation of automated sBPA utility in surgical patients. METHODS:This study was a retrospective review of the outcomes of patients admitted to the University of Minnesota Medical Center (but not to the intensive care unit) from August 2015-March 2016 and compared how the sBPA performed in those having and not having surgery. An sBPA prompted nursing to draw blood for an immediate lactate assay if two modified systemic inflammatory response syndrome (mSIRS) criteria or three mSIRS criteria within 24 hours after surgery were met. Physicians were notified if the lactate concentration was >2\u2009mmol/L. Further review was performed of data collected prospectively on the surgical patients. RESULTS:A total of 10,335 patients were admitted (2,158 surgery and 8,177 non-surgery). Of these, 33% of the surgery patients and 35% of the patients not having surgery triggered sBPAs. In surgery patients, 13% of lactate concentrations were >2\u2009mmol/L versus 25% in patients not having surgery.

Surgery patients triggering sBPAs had longer hospital stays (9.6 vs. 4.4 days; p\u2009<\u20090.05), more surgical site infections (7% vs. 2%; p\u2009<\u20090.05), and a similar mortality rate (3% vs. 4%; p\u2009=\u20090.15) than those who did not trigger an sBPA. CONCLUSION:An sBPA fired in a third of all inpatients, and an sBPA that prompted lactate measurements was less likely to be abnormal in surgery patients than in those not having surgery. There was no difference in the mortality rate in surgical patients who fired and those who did not; however, the sBPA did identify patients with a more complicated post-operative course. Further refinements of the electronic trigger should increase BPA specificity."}

Methods A retrospective chart review of the alerts triggered for central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSIs), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), neonatal sepsis, or clinical deterioration through elevated pediatric early warning scores (PEWS) by automated electronic surveillance of the hospital\u00a0electronic medical record (EMR) over a five-month period among hospitalized children. Interventions instituted in response to the alerts were reviewed from the hospital EMR. Fisher's exact test was performed to detect any significant difference in the proportion of interventions performed for alerts triggered between groups. Results A total of 244 alerts were collected (27 CAUTI, 55 CLABSI, 10 neonatal sepsis, and 152 PEWS alerts). A significant difference in the proportion of interventions instituted after neonatal sepsis and PEWS alerts (9/162, 5.6%) as compared to CLABSI and CAUTI alerts (20/82, 24.4%) was observed (p<0.001; Odds ratio (95% CI):\u00a00.182 (0.079-0.422)). Neonatal sepsis triggered the least number of alerts (10/244, 4.1%) and proportionately fewer interventions than the other clinical alerts. Conclusions Alerts for potential device-associated infections resulted in more clinical intervention than less-specific alerts. Neonatal sepsis alerts resulted in minimal interventions undertaken in response to the alert. Identifying and focusing on alerts benefitting the patient can serve as a better allocation of time and resources. Future studies should explore which newer alerts and their accompanying interventions improve patient outcomes."}

PAH concentrations decrease with increasing latitude in the order of Pallas > Zeppelin > Alert. Forest fire was identified as an important contributing source. Three representative PAHs, phenanthrene (PHE), pyrene (PYR), and benzo[ a]pyrene (BaP) were selected for the assessment of their long-term trends. Significant decline of these PAHs was not observed contradicting the expected decline due to PAH emission reductions. A global 3-D transport model was employed to simulate the concentrations of these three PAHs at the three sites. The model predicted that warming in the Arctic would cause the air concentrations of PHE and PYR to increase in the Arctic atmosphere, while that of BaP, which tends to be particle-bound, is less affected by temperature. The expected decline due to the reduction of global PAH emissions is offset by the increment of volatilization caused by warming. This work shows that this phenomenon may affect the environmental occurrence of other anthropogenic substances, such as more volatile flame retardants and pesticides."}

On October 9, COSD, which had reported an average of one wound botulism case per year during 2001-2016, sent a health alert through the California Health Alert Network, notifying Southern California providers of these two patients, including their signs and symptoms and black tar heroin exposure. In collaboration with the California Department of Public Health, COSD conducted an investigation to identify additional cases, determine risk factors for illness, estimate cost of medical care, and develop recommendations to prevent further illness. By April 18, 2018, nine (eight confirmed and one probable) patients with wound botulism were identified, all of whom were hospitalized; one of the nine died. All nine were persons who inject drugs; seven specifically reported using black tar heroin and six practiced subcutaneous injection known as skin popping. Clinically compatible signs and symptoms included muscle weakness, difficulty swallowing, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty breathing, loss of facial expression, or descending paralysis. All patients were treated with heptavalent botulism antitoxin (BAT). Wound botulism is likely underrecognized because of its rarity and the overlapping signs and symptoms with opioid intoxication, overdose, and other neurologic syndromes including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and myasthenia gravis. Prompt diagnosis, administration of BAT, and provision of supportive care can help stop the progression of paralysis and be lifesaving."}

Here, we report the first cases of platelet concentrates contaminated with Bordetella holmesii The in vitro growth characteristics of this unusual contaminant in platelet concentrate were investigated. Two B. holmesii strains isolated from platelet concentrates, as well as a control strain (Serratia marcescens), were spiked into platelet concentrates (PCs) at 1 and 10 CFU/ml. PCs were stored at 20 to 24\u00b0C under agitation. Samples were collected on days 2, 3, 4, and 7 for colony count and for bacterial screening using the BacT/Alert 3D system. Two PCs were detected as being positive for B. holmesii However, recultures were negative. In vitro, B. holmesii did not grow but remained detectable in PCs. Its viability diminished rapidly in contact with human plasma. Upon screening using the BacT/Alert 3D system, the majority of products spiked with B. holmesii were negative. This is the first description of PCs contaminated with B. holmesii This bacterium survives in blood products and remains dormant at low concentrations in blood products stored at room temperature, thus making difficult its detection with the BacT/Alert 3D system. The present definition of a true-positive culture of PCs may be overly restrictive for certain bacterial strains."}

OBJECTIVE:Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an electronic health record (EHR) provider alert as part of an outbreak-control vaccination program implemented in the emergency department (ED). METHODS:We conducted a retrospective study assessing the impact of a Best Practice Alert (BPA) built into an EHR to prompt providers when a patient was homeless to consider hepatitis A vaccination in the ED. Data were collected over three 6-month time periods: a historical control period, a pre-intervention period, and an intervention period. RESULTS:There were no vaccinations given in the ED in the historical period, which increased to 465 after the implementation of the BPA. During the implementation period, there were 1,482 visits identified among 1,131 patients that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, there were 1,147 (77.5%) visits where the patient either received the vaccine in the ED, had already received the vaccine, or it was not indicated due to the current medical issue. There were also 333 (22.5%) visits where the BPA was active for potential vaccination eligibility, but did not receive it in the ED. CONCLUSIONS:We leveraged an informatics tool developed within our EHR to identify high-risk patients and remind providers of the availability of vaccination in the ED. Using these tools enabled providers to increase vaccination efforts within our ED to help control the community-wide outbreak."}

METHODS:Searches were made of the Divers Alert Network Asia-Pacific Diving Mortality Database; the International Shark Attack File website; the Australian Shark Attack File and the Global Shark Attack File to identify cases of fatal shark attacks on divers in Australia. In addition, a systematic search of published medical and sporting literature was conducted to identify relevant reports. The data collected were scrutinised for relevance and duplication. RESULTS:There were 187 recorded attacks on divers, comprising 112 snorkellers, 62 scuba divers and 13 on divers using surface-supplied breathing apparatus. These included 28 verified deaths: 13 involving snorkellers, eight involving scuba divers, and seven divers using surface-supply. The victims' ages ranged from 13-50 years (mean 31 years). All but three were males. The vast majority of attacks were by Carcharodon carcharias (Great White Shark). CONCLUSION:Spearfishing and other seafood collection, as well as diving near fishing activities and/or seals, were identified as major risk factors.

One of these are alerts in the pharmacy information system. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the experiences of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians with alerts for drug name and strength confusion. METHODS:In May 2017, a cross-sectional survey of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians was performed in community pharmacies in the Netherlands using an online questionnaire. RESULTS:Of the 269 respondents, 86% (n = 230) had noticed the alert for drug name confusion, and 26% (n = 67) for drug strength confusion. Of those 230, 9% (n = 20) had experienced that the alert had prevented dispensing the wrong drug. For drug strength confusion, this proportion was 12% (n = 8). Respondents preferred to have an alert for drug name and strength confusion in the pharmacy information system. 'Alert fatigue' was an important issue, so alerts should only be introduced for frequent confusions or confusions with serious consequences. CONCLUSION:Pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were positive about having alerts for drug confusions in their pharmacy information system and experienced that alerts contributed to the prevention of dispensing errors. To prevent alert fatigue, it was considered important not to include all possible confusions as a new alert: the potential contribution to the prevention of drug confusion should be weighed against the risk of alert fatigue."}
{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "Background:The recommendations of the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's \"Choosing Wisely\u00ae\" initiative recognize the importance of improving the appropriateness of testing behavior and reducing the number of duplicate laboratory tests. Objective:To assess the effectiveness of an electronic medical record Best Practice Alert (BPA or \"pop up\") intervention aimed at reducing duplicate laboratory tests and hospital costs. Design:Comparison of the number of duplicated laboratory tests performed on inpatients before and after the intervention. Setting:University of Florida Health Shands Hospital, Gainesville, FL, USA, during 2014-2017. Intervention:The electronic medical record intervention was a BPA pop-up alert that informed the ordering physician if a recent identical order already existed along with the \"ordering time\", \"collecting time\", \"resulting time\", and the result itself. Main outcome measures:Percentage change in the number of inpatient duplicate orders of selected clinical biochemistry tests and cost savings from reduction of the duplicates. Student's t-test and beta-binomial models were used to analyze the data. Results:Results from the beta-binomial model indicated that the intervention reduced the overall duplicates by 18% (OR=0.82, standard error=0.016, P-value<0.000). Percent reductions in 9 of the 17 tests were statistically significant: serum hemoglobin A1C level, vitamin B12, serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum folate, serum iron, lipid panel, respiratory viral panel, serum thyroid stimulating hormone level, and Vitamin D. Additionally, important cost savings were realized from the reduction of duplicates for each lab test (with the exception of CRP) with an estimated overall savings of $72,543 over 17 months in the post-intervention period. Conclusions:The present study included all hospital inpatients and covered 17 clinical laboratory tests. This rather simple and low-cost intervention resulted in significant reductions in percentage duplicates of several tests and resulted in cost savings. The study also highlights the role of hospitalists in quality improvement."}

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:The Risk Identification Unit (RIU) of the US Dept. of Agriculture's Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health (CEAH) conducts weekly surveillance of national livestock health data and routine coordination with agricultural stakeholders. As part of an initiative to increase the number of species, health issues, and data sources monitored, CEAH epidemiologists are building a surveillance system based on weekly syndromic counts of laboratory test orders in consultation with Colorado State University laboratorians and statistical analysts from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. Initial efforts focused on 12 years of equine test records from three state labs. Trial syndrome groups were formed based on RIU experience and published literature. Exploratory analysis, stakeholder input, and laboratory workflow details were needed to modify these groups and filter the corresponding data to eliminate alerting bias. Customized statistical detection methods were sought for effective monitoring based on specialized laboratory information characteristics and on the likely presentation and animal health significance of diseases associated with each syndrome. METHODS:Data transformation and syndrome formation focused on test battery type, test name, submitter source organization, and specimen type. We analyzed time series of weekly counts of tests included in candidate syndrome groups and conducted an iterative process of data analysis and veterinary consultation for syndrome refinement and record filters. This process produced a rule set in which records were directly classified into syndromes using only test name when possible, and otherwise, the specimen type or related body system was used with test name to determine the syndrome. Test orders associated with government regulatory programs, veterinary teaching hospital testing protocols, or research projects, rather than clinical concerns, were excluded. We constructed a testbed for sets of 1000 statistical trials and applied a stochastic injection process assuming lognormally distributed incubation periods to choose an alerting algorithm with the syndrome-required sensitivity and an alert rate within the specified acceptable range for each resulting syndrome. Alerting performance of the EARS C3 algorithm traditionally used by CEAH was compared to modified C2, CuSUM, and EWMA methods, with and without outlier removal and adjustments for the total weekly number of non-mandatory tests. RESULTS:The equine syndrome groups adopted for monitoring were abortion/reproductive, diarrhea/GI, necropsy, neurological, respiratory, systemic fungal, and tickborne. Data scales, seasonality, and variance differed widely among the weekly time series. Removal of mandatory and regulatory tests reduced weekly observed counts significantly-by >80% for diarrhea/GI syndrome. The RIU group studied outcomes associated with each syndrome and called for detection of single-week signals for most syndromes with expected false-alert intervals >8 and <52 weeks, 8-week signals for neurological and tickborne monitoring (requiring enhanced sensitivity), 6-week signals for respiratory, and 4-week signals for systemic fungal. From the test-bed trials, recommended methods, settings and thresholds were derived. CONCLUSIONS:Understanding of laboratory submission sources, laboratory workflow, and of syndrome-related outcomes are crucial to form syndrome groups for routine monitoring without artifactual alerting. Choices of methods, parameters, and thresholds varied by syndrome and depended strongly on veterinary epidemiologist-specified performance requirements."}

METHODS:This was a multicenter prospective observational study of patients aged \u226565\u2009years consecutively discharged from geriatric and internal medicine wards. Each patient underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment, and PIM and PPO at discharge were determined according to the Screening Tool of Older People's Prescriptions and Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment version\u20092 criteria. A multivariate logistic regression was carried out to identify variables independently associated with PIM and PPO. RESULTS:Among 726 participants (mean age 81.5\u2009years, 47.8% women), the prevalence of PIM and PPO were 54.4% and 44.5%, respectively. Benzodiazepines and proton-pump inhibitors were the drugs most frequently involved with PIM, whereas PPO were often related to 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and drugs for osteoporosis. The number of medications (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.28) and discharge from geriatric units (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.75) were associated with PIM, whereas PPO were independently associated with discharge from geriatric wards (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.31-0.62), age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07), comorbidities (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.04-1.30) and the number of drugs (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.18).

Here we describe and validate the 2B-Alert App, the first mobile application that progressively learns an individual's trait-like response to sleep deprivation in real time, to generate increasingly more accurate individualized predictions of alertness. We incorporated a Bayesian learning algorithm within the validated Unified Model of Performance to automatically and gradually adapt the model parameters to an individual after each psychomotor vigilance test. We implemented the resulting model and the psychomotor vigilance test as a smartphone application (2B-Alert App), and prospectively validated its performance in a 62-hr total sleep deprivation study in which 21 participants used the app to perform psychomotor vigilance tests every 3\u00a0hr and obtain real-time individualized predictions after each test. The temporal profiles of reaction times on the app-conducted psychomotor vigilance tests were well correlated with and as sensitive as those obtained with a previously characterized psychomotor vigilance test device. The app progressively learned each individual's trait-like response to sleep deprivation throughout the study, yielding increasingly more accurate predictions of alertness for the last 24\u00a0hr of total sleep deprivation as the number of psychomotor vigilance tests increased. After only 12 psychomotor vigilance tests, the accuracy of the model predictions was comparable to the peak accuracy obtained using all psychomotor vigilance tests. With the ability to make real-time individualized predictions of the effects of sleep deprivation on future alertness, the 2B-Alert App can be used to tailor personalized fatigue management strategies, facilitating self-management of alertness and safety in operational and non-operational settings."}

To determine the performance of P-Alert for evaluating post-earthquake building safety, we conducted a series of steel-frame shaking table tests with incremental damage. We used the fragility curves of different damage levels and the interstory drift ratios (calculated by the measured acceleration of each story using double integration and a filter) to gauge the potential damage levels. We concluded that the acceptable detection of damage for an entire building is possible. With improvements to the synchronization of the P-Alert sensors, we also anticipate a damage localization feature for the stories of a building."}

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts in electronic health records (EHRs) can help prevent adverse drug events, but such alerts are frequently overridden, raising concerns about their clinical usefulness and contribution to alert fatigue. OBJECTIVE:To study the effect of conversion to a commercial EHR on DDI alert and acceptance rates. DESIGN:Two before-and-after studies. PARTICIPANTS:3277 clinicians who received a DDI alert in the outpatient setting. INTERVENTION:Introduction of a new, commercial EHR and subsequent adjustment of DDI alerting criteria. MAIN MEASURES:Alert burden and proportion of alerts accepted. KEY RESULTS:Overall interruptive DDI alert burden increased by a factor of 6 from the legacy EHR to the commercial EHR. The acceptance rate for the most severe alerts fell from 100 to 8.4%, and from 29.3 to 7.5% for medium severity alerts (P\u2009<\u20090.001). After disabling the least severe alerts, total DDI alert burden fell by 50.5%, and acceptance of Tier 1 alerts rose from 9.1 to 12.7% (P\u2009<\u20090.01). CONCLUSIONS:Changing from a highly tailored DDI alerting system to a more general one as part of an EHR conversion decreased acceptance of DDI alerts and increased alert burden on users. The decrease in acceptance rates cannot be fully explained by differences in the clinical knowledge base, nor can it be fully explained by alert fatigue associated with increased alert burden. Instead, workflow factors probably predominate, including timing of alerts in the prescribing process, lack of differentiation of more and less severe alerts, and features of how users interact with alerts."}

DESIGN:Prospective simulated comparison of two instruments using seeded samples. SETTING:Medical microbiology laboratory. METHODS:Blood culture bottles were seeded in triplicate with each of the standard ATCC strains of aerobes, anaerobes and yeast. TTD was calculated as the length of time from the beginning of culture incubation to the detection of bacterial growth. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:TTD for the various tested organisms on the two microbial detection systems. RESULTS:The 99 bottles of seeded blood cultures incubated in each of the blood culture systems included 21 anaerobic, 39 aerobic and 39 pediatric bottles.

{"keyword": "Alert", "texts": "This research investigated controller' situation awareness by comparing COOPANS's acoustic alerts with newly designed semantic alerts. The results demonstrate that ATCOs' visual scan patterns had significant differences between acoustic and semantic designs. ATCOs established different eye movement patterns on fixations number, fixation duration and saccade velocity. Effective decision support systems require human-centered design with effective stimuli to direct ATCO's attention to critical events. It is necessary to provide ATCOs with specific alerting information to reflect the nature of the critical situation in order to minimise the side effects of startle and inattentional deafness. Consequently, the design of a semantic alert can significantly reduce ATCOs' response time, therefore providing valuable extra time in a time-limited situation to formulate and execute resolution strategies in critical air safety events. The findings of this research indicate that the context-specified design of semantic alerts could improve ATCO's situational awareness and significantly reduce response time in the event of Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA) activation which alerts to two aircraft having less than the required lateral or vertical separation. Practitioner Summary: Eye movements are closely linked with visual attention and can be analysed to explore shifting attention whilst performing monitoring tasks. This research has found that context-specific designed semantic alerts facilitated improved ATCO cognitive processing by integrating visual and auditory resources. Semantic designs have been demonstrated to be superior to acoustic design by directing the operator's attention more quickly to critical situations.APW: area proximity warning; ASRS: aviation safety reporting system; ATC: air traffic control; ATCO: air traffic controller; ATM: air traffic management; COOPANS: cooperation between air navigation service providers; HCI: human-computer interaction; IAA: irish aviation authority; MSAW: minimum safe altitude warning; MTCD: medium-term conflict detection; SA: situation awareness; STCA: short term conflict alert; TP: trajectory prediction."}

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used for analyzing the solubility and dissolution profile of the samples. Results: Fourier Transmission Infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that SFD processed compositions did not affect chemical structure of RH. SEM and Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) revealed that the fabricated spherical and highly porous microparticles were in amorphous state. SFD processed powders showed superior solubility and dissolution behavior; where, 80% of the drug was dissolved within 5 minutes. Conclusion: SFD method can be a promising alternative for enhancing the solubility of poorly water soluble compounds."}

DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study of 90 days' duration. Nonhysterectomized, postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms and at least 6 months' amenorrhea were eligible. On completion of the placebo-controlled portion of the study, participants could elect to receive active treatment for an additional 90 days. RESULTS: The study enrolled 119 participants, 59 and 60 in the Prefest and placebo groups, respectively. A marked reduction of menopausal symptoms, as measured by the Kupperman Index, was observed in the active treatment group compared with the placebo group after 45 days' treatment (mean reduction, 14.8 v 7.2 points, respectively), which was sustained to day 90 (16.8 v 7.8 points; < 0.001). Similarly, greater improvement in quality of life, as measured by the Menopause Quality of Life summary score, was also observed in the active treatment group for the same period (improvement of up to 1.6 points v 0.7 points; < 0.001). The adverse event profile was unremarkable. Of the 114 participants who received the active treatment, 6 withdrew because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The constant-estrogen, intermittent-progestogen regimen was highly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms and in improving quality of life and was well received by the study participants."}

To evaluate the properties of prepared pellets, the size of prepared pellets was investigated by sieve analysis technique and the morphology of pellets was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. Through the dissolution test, factors that have an effect on the dissolution of the drug were evaluated. As the content ratio of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) had increased, the dissolution was proportionally sustained. Eudragit\u00ae RS PO had more marked sustaining effect on the dissolution rate than Eudragit\u00ae RL PO, and the effect was more pronounced with the increased coating level. PEG 6000 was an appropriate plasticizer for DXM pellets, and increasing the content of PEG 6000, was also slightly decreasing the dissolution rate."}

Acute urinary retention (AUR) is regarded as the most serious hazard of untreated BPH. \u03b1-Blockers, such as doxazosin mesylate, and 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors, such as finasteride, are frequently used because they decrease both AUR and the need for BPH-related surgery. An extract of the fruit from American saw palmetto plant has also been used as an alternative treatment for BPH. The paucity of information available concerning the genotoxic action of these compounds led us to assess their activity as inducers of different types of DNA lesions using the somatic mutation and recombination test in Drosophila melanogaster. Finasteride did not induce gene mutation, chromosomal mutation or mitotic recombination, which means it was nongenotoxic in our experimental conditions. On the other hand, doxazosin mesylate and saw palmetto induced significant increases in spot frequencies in trans-heterozygous flies. In order to establish the actual role played by mitotic recombination and by mutation in the genotoxicity observed, the balancer-heterozygous flies were also analyzed, showing no increment in the total spot frequencies in relation to the negative control, for both drugs. Doxazosin mesylate and saw palmetto were classified as specific inducers of homologous recombination in Drosophila proliferative cells, an event linked to the loss of heterozygosity."}

This report presents a robust and quantitative bioluminescence-based assay for screening myogenesis-promoting compounds in chemical libraries. The assay system consists of two stable C2C12 myoblast cell lines, each of which expresses either an N-terminal or a C-terminal split luciferase fragment fused to a naturally split DnaE intein as an indicator for cell fusion. Cell fusion during myogenesis induces bioluminescence in the cytosol because of the reconstitution of luciferases. The luminescence intensity quantitatively represents the progress in the cell fusion and therefore indicates the extent of myogenesis. We applied this assay system to a high-throughput screening of myogenesis-promoting compouns in 1191 pharmacologically proven bioactive small molecules, which revealed two chemical compounds as myogenesis-promoting compounds: Imatinib and Doxazosin mesylate. The assay system enabled a robust and quantitative evaluation of the extent of myogenesis through simple luminescence measurements, and is expected to be widely applicable for high-throughput screening of cell fusion-promoting and inhibiting molecules."}

The high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of related-substances of DXZN are used as fingerprints to follow the procedures used in the manufacturing units. The separation is accomplished on an Inertsil ODS-3 column with acetonitrile-ammonium acetate (10 mM, pH 4.0) as the mobile phase, using a gradient elution mode and monitoring the eluents by a photodiode array detector at 265 nm at ambient temperature. LC-ESI-MS-MS is used to identify the additional impurities formed during the synthesis. The identified impurities were synthesized and characterized by UV, Fourier transform-IR, 1H NMR, and MS data. The detection limits for the impurities are 0.74 - 4.14 x 10(-9) g, and the method is found to be suitable not only for the monitoring of synthetic reactions, but also for quality assurance of DXZN in bulk drugs and formulations."}

Between 2003 and 2008, 67 patients with confirmed diagnoses of pheochromocytoma were enrolled in this study. According to the drug used in preoperative management, patients were divided into two groups: Doxazosin Mesylate pretreatment group (n=36) and Phenoxybenzamine pretreatment group (n=31). Surgery was performed only in patients who met the optimal preoperative condition. The hematocrit decreased significantly (P<0.001) after antiadrenergic therapy in patients pretreated with phenoxybenzamine or doxazosin. There was no significant difference between the fluid intakes during operation in both groups. The systolic arterial pressures both before and after induction of anesthesia were all significantly higher in the doxazosin patients than in the phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). After tumor removed, the lowest systolic arterial pressure was significantly higher in doxazosin group than in phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). The fluctuation of systolic arterial pressure during operation was more stable in doxazosin group than in phenoxybenzamine group (P<0.05). Doxazosin mesylate controlled release tablet was as effective as phenoxybenzamine in preoperative volume expansion. Although phenoxybenzamine provided better arterial pressure control, patients pretreated with DOX experienced more stable perioperative hemodynamic changes, shorter preoperative management periods and more simple medication."}

{"keyword": "Doxazosin mesylate", "texts": "Doxazosin mesylate is an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist that was used to treat hypertension until a major study (ALLHAT; Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) showed that it increased the risk of progressing to heart failure. Doxazosin is now being used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Noradrenaline acts on alpha1-adrenoceptors to contract the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder, and by opposing these actions, doxazosin is beneficial in BPH. Doxazosin also increases apoptosis in the prostate. Although the standard preparation is suitable for once-daily dosing in BPH, it has to be titrated through three steps to its final dose. The controlled-release gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation of doxazosin is more convenient to use as it only has to be titrated through one step. In the treatment of BPH, standard doxazosin reduced both obstructive and irritative symptoms and increased peak urinary flow rate. The main side effects with doxazosin are those commonly associated with lowering blood pressure, although doxazosin lowers blood pressure to a lesser extent in normotensives than hypertensives. There is some evidence that in addition to being easier to use, doxazosin GITS may cause less adverse effects than the standard preparations. The benefits of doxazosin and the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, finasteride, may be additive in BPH especially in men with large prostates. Further trials are necessary in order to determine whether doxazosin GITS is superior to other alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists in BPH."}
{"keyword": "Doxazosin mesylate", "texts": "The physicochemical properties, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, cardiovascular and metabolic effects, adverse effects, dosage, and administration of doxazosin are described, and comparative clinical studies of doxazosin therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension are reviewed. Doxazosin mesylate, an alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. The drug decreases blood pressure by reducing peripheral resistance. Maximum hypotensive effects occur four to eight hours after the dose. Doxazosin favorably affects serum lipids by increasing concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, increasing the HDL:total cholesterol ratio, and decreasing concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. In comparative clinical trials, doxazosin lowered standing and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures as effectively as other alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, diuretics, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel-blocking agents. The most frequently reported adverse effects are dizziness, headache, nausea, lethargy, and fatigue. Doxazosin may be used either alone or in combination with a beta-adrenoceptor inhibitor or a diuretic. Orthostatic hypotension after the first dose occurs infrequently and may be minimized by initiating therapy at a dosage of 1 mg/day. The dosage may be increased at two-week intervals as needed, and blood pressure should be closely monitored. Doxazosin has blood-pressure-lowering effects comparable to those of other alpha 1-adrenoceptor inhibitors and to those of antihypertensives in other drug classes."}

Urine microscopy is not specific and only serves as a guide to bacteriuria. The commonest causative organisms are those from the gastrointestinal tract and vagina. The antibiogram showed that cefuroxime and cephalexin are likely to be effective in treating bacteriuria: ampicillin must be reserved for Gram-negative organisms. For Gram-positive organisms, of which Group B Streptococcus is important, ampicillin is still effective in vitro. Nitrofurantion and cotrimoxazole have excellent activity in vitro and should be considered for therapy. 17.2% of the urine culture yielded mixed growth: likely to indicate that contamination of urine specimens still happens despite the strict instructions given to patients about the collection of a midstream urine specimen.

There is limited information regarding their effects in horses. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of quinapril and its effects on ACE and renin in horses. STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study using healthy mature horses. METHODS: Six healthy horses were administered quinapril at 120\u2009mg i.v., 120\u2009mg per os and 240\u2009mg per os in a 3-way crossover design. Blood was collected for measurement of quinapril and quinaprilat concentrations using ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity and renin activity were measured using a radioenzymatic assay. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic modelling and statistical analyses were performed. RESULTS: No adverse effects were observed during the study period. Intravenous and oral administration significantly inhibited ACE activity. Renin concentrations increased in all groups, but this increase was not statistically significant. Following i.v. administration of quinapril, mean terminal half-life was 0.694\u2009h and 1.734\u2009h for quinapril and quinaprilat, respectively. The mean volume of distribution and clearance for quinapril were 0.242 l/kg bwt and 11.93\u2009ml/kg bwt/min, respectively. Maximum concentration for quinaprilat was 145\u2009ng/ml at 0.167\u2009h. Bioavailability of quinapril following oral administration was <5%. Quinaprilat was detected in all horses following oral administration of quinapril; however, it was below the limit of quantification of the assay (2.5\u2009ng/ml) for most horses in the 120\u2009mg dosing group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that, despite low plasma concentrations, quinapril has sufficient oral absorption to produce inhibition of ACE in healthy horses. Controlled studies in clinically affected horses are indicated. Quinapril provides a potential treatment alternative for horses with cardiovascular and renal disease."}

{"keyword": "Quinapril", "texts": "High sodium (HS) effects on hypertension are well established. Recent evidence implicates a relationship between HS intake and insulin resistance, even in the absence of hypertension. The aim of the current study was to determine whether loss of the vascular actions of insulin may be the driving factor linking HS intake to insulin resistance.Sprague Dawley rats were fed a control (0.31% wt/wt NaCl) or HS (8.00% wt/wt NaCl) diet for 4 weeks and subjected to euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp (10 mU min(-1) kg(-1)) or constant-flow pump-perfused hindlimb studies following an overnight fast. A separate group of HS rats was given quinapril during the dietary intervention and subjected to euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp as above.HS intake had no effect on body weight or fat mass or on fasting glucose, insulin, endothelin-1 or NEFA concentrations. However, HS impaired whole body and skeletal muscle glucose uptake, in addition to a loss of insulin-stimulated microvascular recruitment. These effects were present despite enhanced insulin signalling (Akt) in both liver and skeletal muscle. Constant-flow pump-perfused hindlimb experiments revealed normal insulin-stimulated myocyte glucose uptake in HS-fed rats. Quinapril treatment restored insulin-mediated microvascular recruitment and muscle glucose uptake in vivo.HS-induced insulin resistance is driven by impaired microvascular responsiveness to insulin, and is not due to metabolic or signalling defects within myocytes or liver. These results imply that reducing sodium intake may be important not only for management of hypertension but also for insulin resistance, and highlight the vasculature as a potential therapeutic target in the prevention of insulin resistance."}

The E/e' ratio was also marginally improved (P=0.053), but this effect was more pronounced in patients with E/e' ratio>8 (P=0.005). CFR and E/e' ratio were also improved after 1 month of treatment, particularly in responders after the acute phase. In hypertensive patients, RAS inhibition acutely improved CFR and E/e' ratio independently of BP changes. An acute positive response in these parameters was closely related to sustained improvement after 1 month of single-drug treatment."}
{"keyword": "Quinapril", "texts": "We studied the effects of three various angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril, lisinopril and quinapril) on heart rhythm variability in anesthetized and immobilized rats. In all cases (except for quinapril in experiments on anesthetized animals), the preparations reduced the total rhythm variability and, according to spectrum analysis, increased activity of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system to different degrees and decreased sympathetic tone. Quinapril and lisinopril produced the most pronounced influence on heart rhythm in anesthetized rats; enalapril was less potent in this respect. In immobilized animals, quinapril and enalapril showed the greatest activity and lisinopril the lowest. The more pronounced effect of quinapril both under anesthesia and during immobilization appears to be linked to the highest affinity of quinaprilat to circulatory and tissue compartments of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system."}

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the IMAGINE trial, which tested the effect of the ACE inhibitor quinapril on cardiovascular events after CABG. SETTING: Thoracic surgery clinic/outpatient department. PATIENTS: 2553 stable patients with left ventricular ejection fraction >40% 2-7 days after scheduled CABG. INTERVENTIONS: Randomisation to quinapril or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox regression analysis for the association between postoperative anaemia and cardiovascular events and the effect of quinapril on the incidence of anaemia. RESULTS: Postoperative anaemia was sustained for >50 days in 44% of patients. Sustained postoperative anaemia was associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events during the first 3 months (adjusted HR (adjHR) 1.77, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.85, p=0.012) and during the maximum follow-up of 43 months (adjHR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.65, p=0.008). When haemoglobin (Hb) was considered as a continuous variable, every 1 mg/dl decrease in Hb was associated with a 13% increase in cardiovascular events (adjHR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95, p=0.003) and a 22% increase in all-cause mortality (adjHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.99, p=0.034). Quinapril was associated with a slower postoperative recovery of Hb levels and a higher incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with anaemia (adjHR 1.60, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.4, p=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative anaemia is common, frequently persists for months after CABG surgery and is associated with an impaired outcome. In patients with anaemia, ACE inhibitors slowed recovery from postoperative anaemia and increased the incidence of cardiovascular events after CABG."}

Previous data regarding changes in capillary density and angiogenesis during ACE inhibition are controversial. The aim of the following study was to determine myocardial microcirculation and heart function in the rat after coronary stenosis using non invasive MR imaging techniques. MR spin labeling and cine techniques have been performed in female Wistar rats 2weeks after coronary artery stenosis. In one group, animals were treated with quinapril in a dose of 6mg/kg/day. Perfusion, relative blood volume (RBV), LV mass and function were determined non-invasively 2weeks after treatment. Finally, fibrosis and capillary density were analyzed histologically. Additionally, hemodynamic measurements were realized in a further group in order to calculate systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Quinapril resulted in a significant increase in perfusion at rest in the remote and the poststenotic myocardium with improved systolic function and a decrease in SVR compared to the non treated control group. Additionally, maximum perfusion and RBV were slightly elevated whereas capillary density was unchanged among the groups. MRI allows for non-invasive quantification of functional microcirculation and heart function. In addition to the well known effect of ACE inhibition on systolic function, treatment with the tissue specific ACE inhibitor quinapril revealed an important microvascular improvement, especially at arteriolar level. These findings may support the use of tissue ACE inhibitors to improve cardiac microcirculation after ischemia."}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Outpatient treatment was given to 60 patients with AH (mean age 55.3 +/- 9.6 years) in combination with mild or moderate DM (group 1) and free of DM (group 2). The patients were observed for 12 weeks. Clinical and biochemical blood tests, ECG, echo-CG, measurements of blood pressure were made in all the patients. RESULTS: Quinapril course (mean dose 23.3 +/- 9.8 mg/day) in combination with indapamide (1.5 mg/ day) produced a complete hypotensive effect in group 1 (23 patients, 76.7%), in group 2--25 (83.3%). DM patients demonstrated reduction of fasting and postprandial glycemia and cholesterol, time of isovolumic relaxation reduced in group 1 by 9.1%, in group 2 by 19.8% (p < 0.01).

{"keyword": "Quinapril", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Angiotensin II-mediated increases in sympathetic activity may contribute to smaller blood-pressure decreases in response to dihydropyridines in young versus older hypertensive patients. We evaluated whether quinapril unmasks angiotensin II-dependent sympathetic activity on amlodipine. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, clinical trial, young mild hypertensives were randomized to quinapril for 1 week (study 1), followed by quinapril + amlodipine for 6 weeks (study 2), followed by amlodipine + placebo for 6 weeks (study 3), or else were randomized to placebo for 1 week (study 1), followed by placebo + amlodipine for 6 weeks (study 2), followed by amlodipine + quinapril for 6 weeks (study 3). Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and plasma hormones were analyzed at the end of each treatment period. Twenty-one subjects completed this study. RESULTS: Quinapril alone decreased BP by 8 +/- 3/6 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg, and amlodipine alone decreased BP by 6 +/- 3/4 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD). Quinapril combined with amlodipine caused a drop of 13 +/- 3/13 +/- 3 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg in one group, and 14 +/- 3/14 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) mm Hg in the second group. Six weeks after discontinuation of quinapril, amlodipine alone caused no change (0 +/- 3/-2 +/- 3) (mean +/- SD). The MSNA decreased by 3 bursts/100 heartbeats at visits 2 v 1 and 3 v 2 (P = .02 for time effect), regardless of treatment. Angiotensin II showed small increases with each visit in the first group, and small decreases in the second group (P = .02 for treatment effect). CONCLUSIONS: It appears that amlodipine does not activate the renin-angiotensin system to counteract its BP-lowering effect in young hypertensives. Similarly, no angiotensin II-dependent component in MSNA appears to be present at baseline or to be induced by amlodipine."}

Treatment was for 2-3 years. The primary outcome measure was the number of new ischemic ulcers appearing on the hands; secondary measures were the frequency and severity of RP attacks, skin score, treatments for ischemia, health status (measured by the Short Form 36 instrument), measures of kidney and lung function, and echocardiographic estimates of pulmonary artery pressure. An intent-to-treat analysis was used.Quinapril did not affect the occurrence of digital ulcers or the frequency or severity of RP episodes. It did not alter the treatments that were prescribed for either infected ulcers or severe RP symptoms. There was no apparent effect on the estimated tricuspid gradient. Health status was not affected by quinapril, and one-half of the patients who believed they had benefited from the trial treatment were in the placebo arm.

METHODS: In a PubMed search for the terms \"quinaprilat\" and \"quinapril\", literature relevant for this review was selected. RESULTS: Quinaprilat is a potent nonsulfhydryl selective ACE inhibitor with a short elimination half-life of 2 - 3 h, but due to slow dissociation from tissue ACE, once daily dosing is sufficient for effective ACE inhibition. Quinaprilat is excreted mainly in urine. In long-term animal studies, quinaprilat was not teratogenic, mutagenic or carcinogenic. However, due to the risk of fetal and neonatal morbidity and death, it should not be administrated in pregnancy. Quinaprilat is characterized by an excellent safety profile; adverse events occur infrequently and are rarely serious.

In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of local application of corticosteroids combined with surgery for CSH.We retrospectively analysed the data of the patients undergoing surgery and local application of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection (MPSS) into the hematoma cavity. Neurological status was assessed by Markwalder's Grading Scale (MGS). Recurrence was defined as deteriorating neurological status with radiological evidence of reaccumulation.A total of 26 patients were enrolled in this study. During the follow-up period, all patients made excellent neurological recovery. 24 (92.3%) patients' MGS was grade 0 at 12 months after the surgery. There was no mortality or recurrence. 5 patients (19.2%) suffered postoperative complications, of which 2 developed some subdural air collection, 2 had a partial seizure attack and 1 developed an acute epidural hemorrhage.The results suggest that local application of MPSS combined with surgery is a safe and effective method in the management of CSH. It may reduce hematoma recurrence."}

OBJECTIVE:The effects of L. cuneata aqueous extract (LCW) on testosterone-induced prostatic hyperplasia (TPH) were examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Male Wistar rats (10\u2009weeks, 330-350\u2009g) were randomly divided to 6 groups (n\u2009=\u20096): Control group; TPH group (3\u2009mg/kg, s.c, daily); TPH\u2009+\u2009LCW (25, 50, 100\u2009mg/kg); TPH\u2009+\u2009Finasteride 10\u2009mg/kg for 6\u2009weeks. At the end of treatment, histological change of prostate, serum dihydrotestosterone (DHT) level, mRNA expression of 5\u03b1-reductase, inflammatory factors, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in prostate were examined. Then, LCW was treated with BPH-1, a human BPH cell line, at 25, 50, 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL for 24\u2009h and examine mRNA level of androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In addition, the content of vicenin-2 was analyzed. RESULTS:LCW treatment of TPH inhibited serum DHT levels by 54.5, 51.2 and 54.1% and mRNA expression of 5\u03b1-reductase were inhibited 54.3, 61.3 and 73.6%, respectively. In addition, mRNA expression of inflammatory factors, PCNA and FGF-2 were decreased in the prostate of rats. Also, LCW attenuated mRNA level of AR and PSA in BPH-1 cell. The content of vicenin-2 in the LCW was analyzed to 0.89\u2009mg/g. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:Based on the results, LCW is a potential pharmacological candidate for the treatment of prostatic hyperplasia."}

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Inhibitors of 5\u03b1-steroid reductase are drugs used to treat androgen-dependent conditions including prostate diseases and androgenic alopecia. Finasteride was the first on the market and is currently the most widely used inhibitor. Dutasteride was the second inhibitor to be approved and has a similar safety profile. Common adverse events of treatment consist of sexual disorders and a negative affect balance. It was described that the prolonged use of 5\u03b1-steroid reductase inhibitors in patients with alopecia can cause persistent side effects called a post-finasteride syndrome (PFS), that is not just a simple coexistence of events, but rather a definite syndrome with an iatrogenic background. PFS occurs in susceptible individuals even after small doses of the drug and can last for a long time after the discontinuation of treatment. A deterioration in the quality of life in affected individuals does not justify use of the drug. Wider recognition of PFS symptoms, its incidence, course, prevention, and treatment possibilities will allow the indications for drug use to be reconsidered and treatment to be more personalized. Knowledge about PFS will also help to provide the best treatment for affected individuals and to properly educate patients before obtaining an informed consent for therapy with 5\u03b1-steroid reductase inhibitors."}

However, there have only been a few studies investigating its long-term efficacy. Moreover, its effect on various types of AGA remains unknown. In this study, the authors investigated the 5-year efficacy of finasteride 1 mg in Korean men with AGA and analyzed the changes in hair growth according to the distribution of hair loss. The medical records of male AGA patients who were treated with oral finasteride for a period of at least 5 years at two university hospitals were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' photographs were evaluated using the basic and specific (BASP) classification and investigator's global assessment. Of the total 126 patients, 108 (85.7%) showed improvement after 5 years of treatment. According to the BASP classification, hair loss of the anterior hair line (basic type), vertex (V type), and frontal area (F type) was improved in 44.4%, 89.7% and 61.2% of patients, respectively. The V type showed a more rapid and steady improvement compared with the other types. Progression of alopecia after peak improvement was seen in 10.3% of cases of the V type, 16.2% of the F type and 0% of the basic type. In conclusion, finasteride 1 mg showed a sustainable effect for at least 5 years in Korean male AGA patients. The exact time points showing signs of first clinical improvement and sustainability were different depending on the type of alopecia."}

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Background:Investigators have used administrative claims to better understand cancer outcomes when a research question cannot feasibly be examined within a study. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) showed that seven years of finasteride reduced prostate cancer (PC) risk by 25% in men age 55 years or older. However, it was unclear whether the observed reduction in PC for finasteride participants would be maintained after finasteride discontinuation. Methods:We examined PC diagnoses identified by PCPT study records and Medicare claims (finasteride = 9423, placebo = 9457). A Medicare-defined PC diagnosis algorithm was defined using diagnosis and procedure codes. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine time to PC within prespecified follow-up windows (<6.5, 6.5-7.5, and >7.5 years) using time-dependent covariates interacting with intervention assignment to account for the PCPT protocol-specified end-of-study biopsy at seven years. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results:Median follow-up using the linked database was 16 years. Overall, finasteride arm participants had a 21.1% decrease in the hazard ratio of PC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74 to 0.84, P < .001). The beneficial effect of finasteride in reducing the hazard ratio of PC was most pronounced in the first 7.5 years (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.77, P < .001), consistent with the original study findings; after 7.5 years, there was no increased risk of PC for finasteride arm participants (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.96 to 1.26, P = .18). Conclusions:Finasteride provides a substantial reduction in PC through 16 years of follow-up. There was no strong evidence that the benefit of finasteride diminished after the end-of-study follow-up. Utilizing Medicare claims to augment PCPT follow-up illustrates how the novel use of secondary data sources can enhance the ability to detect long-term outcomes from prospective studies."}

OBJECTIVE:To determine the predictive characteristics of biomarkers for prostate cancer for cancer on biopsy following 3 months of finasteride use compared with placebo. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS:383 men from multiple clinical sites with intermediate prostate cancer risk, without history of prostate cancer, were randomly allocated in a double-blinded manner, 4:1, to receive either finasteride or placebo for 90 days at which time a prostate biopsy was performed. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:The primary outcomes were associations of biomarkers with prostate cancer that were tested using multiple logistic regression and area under the receiver operating curves (AUC). Biomarkers for PCA risk (PCA3, TMPRSS2:ERG (T2:ERG) gene product, and PSA) were measured at baseline and at biopsy in a blinded fashion to assess the predictive performance of baseline levels, 90-day levels, and measures of change relative to standard predictors. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS:A total of 292 (233 finasteride; 59 placebo) randomized patients underwent biopsy and were analyzed. On finasteride, baseline and 90-day measures of PCA3 and T2:ERG had similar moderate discrimination capacity with AUCs 62 to 65% (p-values < 0.001 and 0.001, respectively), but their rates of change had no discrimination ability (AUC 51%, (95% CI 43 to 60% p = 0.72) and 48% (95% CI 44 to 60%, p = 0.62), respectively).) Relative to baseline, the 90-day PCA3 and PSA decreased in the finasteride group by 25% and 50%, respectively (both p<0.001). T2:ERG had a smaller, non-significant change post finasteride treatment (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS:Short-term finasteride therapy did not improve performance of the most commonly-employed prostate cancer biomarkers. Threshold values for new biomarkers of prostate cancer should be interpreted with caution in patients receiving finasteride until formal validation of test performance in these patients is conducted. PATIENT SUMMARY:Three months of finasteride treatment did not increase the accuracy for predicting the outcome on prostate biopsy but did have a significant effect on biomarker values. Adjustments to thresholds for biopsy for men on finasteride are proposed. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01296672."}

While the incidence of persistent sexual, mental, and physical side effects despite quitting finasteride is unknown, and the condition is not recognized by the scientific community, individuals who suffer from PFS do present with very distinctive and homogenous symptoms. The concept has emerged from reports of nondermatologists, neuroendocrinological research, case reports, and uncontrolled studies. These have been scrutinized by hair experts who found that persistent sexual side effects were only documented in low-quality studies with a strong bias selection and a significant nocebo effect. Others totally dispute the credibility of the PFS. In any case, the PFS is a problem that has to be dealt with. Low-quality studies neither confirm nor refute the condition as a valid nosologic entity. Therefore, it is as inappropriate to dismiss the condition, as it would be to demonize finasteride for the treatment of male pattern hair loss. Whether the PFS represents a nocebo reaction or a real drug adverse event is irrelevant, while the best way to alleviate the emotional distress related to hair loss is to effectively treat the condition causing the problem. It is not sufficient to only discuss the plausibility of the PFS. There is a need for practical recommendations to include such important issues as patient selection and risk assessment, appropriate patient information, how to react in case of drug-related adverse events, issues of fertility and malignancy, management of the PFS, and alternatives, specifically the use of topical finasteride. It is the aim of this commentary to provide the respective information."}

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in men with BPH show that these drugs impair libido and cause erectile dysfunction. Meta-analyses of the RCTs confirm the findings, estimating odds ratio (OR) values for these adverse effects at around 1.50. A problem with meta-analyses that do not report absolute risks with drug vs placebo and that extract ORs instead of relative risks (RRs) from RCT data is that it is hard for the reader to know how to interpret the findings and communicate them to patients. Had the RR been 1.50, the reader would conclude that the risk with drug is 50% higher than the risk with placebo; this is easily understood because the risk with placebo would be available from the RCTs. In contrast, an OR of 1.50 means that the odds with drug are 50% higher than the odds with placebo; understanding this requires a knowledge of what the odds with placebo are as well as an understanding of what odds mean. Odds are not as easily understood as risks are. Odds are numerically different from risks, and the OR is numerically different from the RR. The difference between the OR and the RR is numerically small when the risks are similar in the two groups and also when the risks are dissimilar but the risk is small in the group of interest. The difference between the OR and the RR becomes increasingly large when the risks are dissimilar in the two groups and when the risk in the group of interest is not small. Smallness of risk, in this context, has been conservatively stated as 10%, but it could be possible to use a higher cutoff, such as 20%.

METHODS:The cost-effectiveness of 5 mg finasteride, 0.5 mg dutasteride, 10 mg alfuzosin, 10 mg terazosin, 0.4 mg tamsulosin, 4 mg doxazosin, and the combination therapy of 5 mg finasteride and 8 mg doxazosin was evaluated using a Markov model over a 30-year period. The costs were estimated using national tariffs and were reported in US dollars. Cost and effectiveness outcomes were discounted at a rate of 5% per year. Men (aged \u226540 years) with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and uncomplicated benign prostatic hyperplasia were included in the analysis. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed on important parameters with Monte-Carlo simulation. RESULTS:Finasteride alone or in combination with doxazosin dominated all \u03b1-blockers. After excluding dominated alternatives, the incremental cost-utility ratio for combination therapy was $377 per quality-adjusted life-year, being a cost-effective alternative using the threshold of $15 000. Model results were robust to changes in costs, utility weights, and probabilities. Acceptability curves consistently demonstrated that the combination therapy was most likely cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS:The combination of finasteride and doxazosin is cost-effective compared with dutasteride, tamsulosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia with moderate or severe symptoms who are older than 40 years."}
{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Finasteride is primarily used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male androgenetic alopecia (MAA). Five-alpha reductase inhibitors (5\u03b1-RIs) could induce male sexual dysfunction due to their effects on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. There is evidence suggesting that 5\u03b1-RIs may independently increase the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED). However, many investigators believe that side effects of 5\u03b1-RIs will disappear with continuous treatment. Considerable controversy exists regarding the severity and persistence of side effects of finasteride on ED. The aim of this review was to summarize current research studies on finasteride associated with ED. The search strategy used each term of finasteride and ED against PubMed database to identify related studies. ED data reported from available trials for finasteride were summarized and reviewed. Although there is not enough evidence to prove the relationship between finasteride and ED, most studies in this review found that finasteride for BPH was correlated with ED. However, most studies included in this review revealed that finasteride for MAA was not correlated with ED. On the other hand, some studies reported side effects of finasteride associated with sexual dysfunction, including ED, male infertility, ejaculation problem, and loss of libido, even in MAA patients. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to further determine the mechanism and effects of finasteride on ED. However, physicians should discuss with their patients possible long-term effects of finasteride on sexual function, although we do not have evidence showing that adverse events of sexual dysfunction are absolutely associated with 5\u03b1-RIs."}

Several recent studies have reported adverse sexual and spermatogenic events among young men using 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors, such as erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and infertility. In this review, we summarize and analyze the literature regarding the efficacy and safety of these medications, with an overall focus on men's health. RECENT FINDINGS:Finasteride for the treatment of male pattern hair loss was considered safe according to many previous clinical trials. However, these trials have been recently criticized for inadequate safety reporting. Comprehensive review of the current literature reveals that there is a disproportionately high number of men with 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitor-associated sexual dysfunction and infertility. Although uncommon, the use of 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors is associated with serious and persistent sexual and reproductive side effects, such as erectile dysfunction, decreased ejaculate volume, decreased libido, and infertility."}

METHODS:Forty male SD rats were randomly and equally divided into groups A, B, C and D, those in groups A and B fed with normal saline as the control and those in C and D with finasteride at 40 mg per kg of the body weight per day, A and C for 14 days and B and D for 28 days. Then the seminal vesicles of the animals were harvested for HE staining, measurement of MVD, determination of the expressions of CD34 and VEGF by immunohistochemistry, and observation of histomorphological changes in the seminal vesicle. RESULTS:The expressions of CD34 in groups C and D were decreased by 6.7% and 15.8% as compared with those in A and B (P<0.01), and that in group D decreased by 9.3% in comparison with that in C (P<0.01).

PFS is a provisional diagnosis encompassing a cluster of sexual, physical, and psychological and/or neurologic symptoms associated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use that emerge or continue after discontinuation of medication. MATERIALS AND METHODS:FAERS dataset of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors from April 2011 to October 2014 was obtained. Each FAERS report had 16 categories for completion, but not every report was fully completed. Statistical analysis compared variables of interest between the 2 doses of finasteride (1 mg vs 5 mg). RESULTS:From FAERS, 2048 monotherapy cases were identified: 1581 of finasteride 1 mg, 240 of finasteride 5 mg, and 226 of unreported doses. Possibly related to labeling changes, from 2011 to 2014, there was a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) reported involving 1 mg dosing. Finasteride use was reported with many sexual AEs including diminished libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory complaints. Other common AEs included dermatologic, metabolic, and psychological and/or neurologic complaints. There were more AE reports with the 1 mg dose than the 5 mg dose. One case of dutasteride reported back pain, not generally attributed to PFS. CONCLUSION:FAERS data suggests that finasteride exposure is reported with a diverse collection of symptoms, particularly in younger men on 1 mg dosage compared to older men on 5 mg. Many of these complaints fall well out of the realm of previously established AEs from long-term controlled studies."}

The neuroprotection is likely to be mediated by allopregnanolone (ALLO) metabolized from P4 by 5\u03b1-reductase, since the neuroprotection is attenuated by the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor finasteride, which was done only with young animals though. Thus, we do not know the contribution of ALLO to the P4-induced neuroprotection in aged animals. We examined effects of finasteride on the P4-induced neuroprotection in aged (16-18-month-old) male rats subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. MCAO rats were given an 8\u00a0mg/kg P4 6\u00a0h after MCAO followed by the same treatment once a day for successive 3\u00a0days. Finasteride, a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor, at 20\u00a0mg/kg was intraperitoneally injected 30\u00a0min prior to the P4-injections. P4 markedly reduced neuronal damage 72\u00a0h after MCAO, and the P4-induced neuroprotection was apparently suppressed by finasteride in the aged animals. However, post-ischemic administration of finasteride alone (20\u00a0mg/kg) significantly prevented neuronal damage and the impairment of Rotarod performance after MCAO in aged male rats, but not in young ones. The androgen receptor antagonist flutamide markedly suppressed the neuroprotection of finasteride in the cerebral cortex, but not in the striatum, suggesting the androgen receptor-dependent mechanism of the finasteride-induced neuroprotection in the cerebral cortex. Our findings suggested, for the first time, the potential of finasteride as a therapeutic agent in post-ischemic treatment of strokes in aged population."}

Finasteride is an orally active, specific inhibitor of 5\u03b1-reductase, which is localized to many androgen-dependent tissues. Finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone (T) to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and is commonly used to treat benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and male pattern baldness (MPB), both disorders associated with elevated DHT levels and 5\u03b1-reductase activity in the prostate and hair follicles, respectively. It is now acknowledged that long-term use and discontinuation of finasteride has adverse effects (AEs); however, these claims have not been well documented. In this study, discussion board posts (forums) were analyzed as self-reports of what finasteride users indicate is problematic for them. Reports were categorized by the age of subjects as well as the types of AEs described: antiandrogenic, estrogenic, central, and nonspecific/severe. A total of 244 cases were recorded and analyzed on the discussion forum on propeciahelp.com . Among these, 74 (32%) cases reported antiandrogenic affects, 43 (19%) reported estrogenic effects, 70 (30%) reported central effects, 11 (5%) reported nonspecific/severe AEs, and 31 (14%) reported AEs in all categories. The categorization of AEs may prompt further investigation into the pathophysiology of post-finasteride syndrome (PFS).

Finasteride (4-aza-3-oxosteroid) is a potent anti-baldness compound that selectively and competitively inhibits the 5\u03b1-reductase isoenzymes. Prolonged oral use of finasteride leads to the emergence of sexual disorders including decrease in libido, gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, orgasm disorders and mood disturbances. Since, hair follicles widely home in 5\u03b1-reductase, topical formulations of finasteride in comparison to its oral formulations are expected to potentially reduce its systemic adverse effects. The analysis of literature has revealed some delivery systems developed for the enhanced and localized penetration of finasteride into the skin. These finasteride delivery systems include polymersomes, vesicular nanocarriers, vesicular ethosomal carriers, liposomes and niosomes, liquid crystalline nanoparticles, topical solutions and gels. The aim of this review article is to briefly amass all literature on topical delivery of finasteride to elaborate best dosage form, i.e. formulation having maximum permeation rate. This study will serve as a future perspective regarding topical delivery of finasteride. The literature analysis has exhibited that most of the previous investigators have used propylene glycol in their finasteride-loaded topical formulations, while poloxamer P407, monoolein, transcutol P and choline was used in few formulations. Moreover, among all drug delivery systems, finasteride liposomal gel system consisting of 2% methyl cellulose and gel system containing poloxamer P407 exhibited the highest flux with a value of 28.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5g/cm2h and 23.1 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5g/cm2h, respectively.

Dietary intake altered progesterone and estradiol serum concentrations but without correlated changes in placental 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase cytochrome P450 or aromatase activity. 5alpha-reduced pregnane metabolites were identified in ewes at 145 days of gestation, but concentrations were lower than those of progesterone. Finasteride inhibited 5alpha-reduced progesterone metabolism but did not impact serum progesterone concentrations in these ewes. We conclude that (1) diet-induced changes in serum progesterone and estradiol concentrations are not likely a result of altered placental synthesis of sex steroid but most likely by their metabolism, and (2) metabolism by 5\u03b1-reduction is not a major determinant of systemic progesterone concentrations in late gestation ewes."}

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "AIMS:Finasteride inhibits the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Because androgen regulates dopaminergic system in the brain, it could be hypothesized that finasteride may inhibit dopaminergic system. The present study therefore investigates the effects of finasteride in adolescent and early developmental rats on dopaminergic system, including contents of dopamine and its metabolites (dihydroxy phenyl acetic acid and homovanillic acid) and tyrosine hydroxylase expressions both at gene and protein levels. Meanwhile, open-field behaviors of the rats are examined because of the regulatory effect of dopaminergic system on the behaviors. METHODS:Open-field behaviors were evaluated by exploratory and motor behaviors. Dopamine and its metabolites were assayed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA and protein expressions were determined by real-time qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. RESULTS:It was found that in adolescent male rats, administration of finasteride at doses of 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg for 14\u00a0days dose dependently inhibited open-field behaviors, reduced contents of dopamine and its metabolites in frontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, and down-regulated tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA and protein expressions in substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. However, there was no significant change of these parameters in early developmental rats after finasteride treatment. CONCLUSION:These results suggest that finasteride inhibits dopaminergic system and open-field behaviors in adolescent male rats by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, and imply finasteride as a potential therapeutic option for neuropsychiatric disorders associated with hyperactivities of dopaminergic system and androgen."}

The aim was to study the effect of FSD particle size reduction on the pharmacokinetic, tissue distribution and cellular permeation. An optimized drug micro- and nano-particles were developed, characterized, administered to group of rats, and systemic pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution within target and not-target organs were determined using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy technique. Moreover, the cellular permeation of the prepared formulations through normal prostate epithelial cells was assessed and compared to pure FSD. The developed micro- and nano-particles were of 930 and 645\u2009nm, respectively. Plasma maximum drug levels (Cmax) and overall exposure (AUC) of both formulations were not significantly higher than unformulated drug. However, micronized FSD achieved significant higher concentration within the target tissue (prostate) within the current study compared to pure drug and nano-sized formulation as well. Yet, this is explained by the higher sequestration ability of spleen tissue to the nano-sized formula compared to micro-sized FSD. At the cellular level, permeation of nano-sized FSD through prostate epithelial cells was superior to the unformulated FSD as well as the micro-sized drug formulation. FSD particle size reduction significantly influences its cellular permeation and to a lesser extend affect its systemic pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution after oral administration."}

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "NEW FINDINGS:What is the central question of this study? What are the contributions of allopregnanolone, the neuroactive metabolite of progesterone, and nuclear (nPR) and membrane (mPR) progesterone receptors to the respiratory effect of progesterone in newborn rats? What is the main finding and its importance? Acute progesterone injection increases the apnoea frequency, whereas finasteride (which blocks the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone) reduces apnoea frequency. An nPR agonist decreases apnoea frequency in males and an mPR agonist decreases apnoea frequency in males and females. Chronic injection of progesterone decreases the frequency of apnoea more efficiently in males than in females. We tested the hypothesis that the effects of progesterone on apnoea frequency in newborn rats are the result of a balance between its neuroactive metabolite, allopregnanolone (GABAA receptor modulator), and progesterone receptors. We used male and female rats between 10 and 12\u00a0days of age and recorded respiratory and metabolic parameters (whole-body plethysmography), and assessed the frequency and duration of apnoeas in normoxia. We tested the effects of a single injection of progesterone (4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 , i.p.), finasteride (10\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 , i.p.; a 5\u03b1-reductase antagonist, which blocks the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone), finasteride plus progesterone, or agonists of the nuclear or membrane progesterone receptors (R5020 or Org-od-02-0, 4\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 ). To test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to progesterone reduces the frequency of apnoeas, we used male and female rats treated daily with progesterone between postnatal days 3 and 12. The acute injection of progesterone reduced minute ventilation and metabolic rate and increased the frequency of apnoeas. Finasteride decreased the frequency of apnoeas, and finasteride plus progesterone did not increase apnoea frequency but decreased minute ventilation in female rats. Although R5020 decreased apnoea frequency only in males, Org-od-02-0 decreased apnoea frequency in males and females and decreased respiratory frequency in females. Chronic progesterone treatment reduced apnoea frequency more efficiently in males than in females, but in females (not in males) an acute injection of caffeine (the gold standard for the treatment of apnoea in preterm neonates) further reduced apnoea frequency. Apnoea frequency in newborn rats is, in part, determined by a sex-specific balance between allopregnanolone, GABAA receptors and progesterone receptors."}

Testicular tissue was also used for evaluating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and apoptotic proteins. Epididymis weight, seminal vesicle weight, prostate weight, penile weight and vas deferens sperm motility showed significant differences between the F group and the CTR, F + DA 100 and F + DA 200 groups. There was no significant change in the testosterone level. DHT level decreased significantly in the F group compared with the CTR group. Testis tissue revealed significant changes in spermatogenic cell density, Johnsen's score and apoptotic index. Western blot showed significant changes in the ER stress and apoptotic markers.

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Introduction:Finasteride (FIN) is known as type II 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor, which has been approved for the treatment and prevention of androgenetic alopecia. Administration of FIN by oral route has led to undesirable systemic side effects that include mood disturbance, gynecomastia, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculation disorder. The aim was to improve FIN delivery through skin layers and hair follicles that could possibly reduce its major side effects resulting from long-term oral administration for the treatment and prevention of male pattern baldness. Materials and methods:FIN was formulated as nano-transferosomal (NTF) gel formulations (F1-3). The prepared formulations were characterized for encapsulation efficiency, particle size, ex vivo skin permeation, and kinetic modeling. In addition, visualization of NTF skin penetration using a fluorescence laser microscope was carried out for the selected formula (F2). Results and discussion:The results showed that FIN encapsulation efficiency percentage was 69.72 \u00b1 8.36, 89.43 \u00b1 6.82, and 93.1 \u00b1 1.93 for F1, F2, and F3, respectively. FIN-NTF average vesicle sizes were 299.6 \u00b1 45.6, 171 \u00b1 25.6, and 197.4 \u00b1 29.1 nm for F1, F2, and F3, respectively. FIN-NTF formulations (F1-3) showed enhancement and improvement in the amount of FIN permeated compared with raw FIN gel formula. The NTF formula revealed uniform fluorescence (rhodamine) intensity across rat skin, which indicated improved delivery through skin layers compared with control gel formula. Conclusion:These results indicated that NTF gel formula showed the ability to boost FIN delivery across skin layers and could be applied as an alternative for oral therapy."}

An attempt was made to prepare ethosomes of FIN with a size range 100-300\u2009nm to enhance its delivery to the PSU. Finasteride loaded ethosomes (FES) were prepared using an ultra-probe sonicator and characterized for its size, morphology, surface charge and entrapment efficiency. The ability of FES to permeate across rat skin and frontal scalp skin of human cadaver was also evaluated. The spherical shaped ethosomes of different batches were in the size range of 107.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.50\u00a0to 220.4\u2009\u00b1\u20096.92\u2009nm and showed good permeation across rat skin and frontal scalp skin of human cadaver when compared to the unencapsulated FIN. The results portrayed the ability of FES to permeate across the stratum corneum to reach the PSU of the hair follicle. Although additional use of permeation enhancer increases the permeation of FIN across the skin, its addition may not be a favourable option for the deposition of ethosomes in the PSU."}
{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Absence epilepsy is a generalized nonconvulsive type of epilepsy that is characterized by spike-wave discharges (SWD) with a frequency of 2.5-4 Hz in the EEG. The activation of the GABAergic system in central nervous system suppresses convulsive seizures but exacerbates absence seizures. Endogenous neuroactive steroids such as 3\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one (3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THPROG; allopregnanolone) and 3\u03b1,21-dihydroxy-5\u03b1-pregnan-20-one (3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THDOC, allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosteron) are GABA-A receptor-positive allosteric modulators. Finasteride which is a 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor can selectively block the synthesis of endogenous steroids. In this study, we compared the effects of endogenous steroids (THPROG and THDOC) on SWD by using finasteride-treated Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats as a model of absence epilepsy. Wistar (WIS-THPROG and WIS-THDOC) and WAG/Rij (WAG-THPROG and WAG-THDOC) rats were divided into 4 groups (n = 8). After stereotactic surgical procedures, all rats were prepared for direct cortical EEG measurement. Following finasteride administration to each group, THPROG was administered to WIS-THPROG and WAG-THPROG groups, and THDOC to WIS-THDOC and WAG-THDOC groups intraperitoneally. While there was no any SWD activity detected in WIS-THPROG and WIS-THDOC groups, a significant increase in SWD count in WAG-THPROG (p = 0.012) and in WAG-THDOC (p = 0.012), and in SWD total duration in WAG-THPROG (p = 0.012) and WAG-THDOC groups (p = 0.011) were observed after steroid injection.

Pre (6 weeks of age) and post (12 weeks of age) groups received finasteride or dutasteride to determine the efficacy of these pharmaceuticals on prostate cancer (PCa) development in male C57BL/6 TRAMP x FVB mice. Post-Dutasteride treatment was more effective than Pre-Dutasteride treatment, and dutasteride treatments were more effective than finasteride treatments in decreasing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) progression and PCa development. Finasteride and Pre-Dutasteride treatments significantly decreased high-grade PIN incidence, but increased poorly differentiated PCa incidence. In this study, molecular changes in prostates of these mice were characterized in an effort to elucidate the discordant response in Pre-Dutasteride and finasteride groups, and determine why Post-Dutasteride treatment was more effective.Ki-67 (proliferation marker) and androgen receptor (AR) protein, apoptotic DNA fragmentation (TUNEL assay), 5\u03b1-reductase 1 (5\u03b1R1) and 5\u03b1-reductase 2 (5\u03b1R2) mRNA were quantified in male TRAMP mice prostate tissues with genitourinary weight < 1 and > 1 gram. Overall, proliferation and AR were decreased and apoptosis was increased in most tumors versus prostate epithelium and hyperplasia. Proliferation and AR were increased notably in hyperplasia versus prostate epithelium and tumor. There were no clear trends or differences in 5\u03b1-reductase 1 and 5\u03b1-reductase 2 levels between large and small tumors. The discordant response in Pre-Finasteride and Pre-Dutasteride groups may be due to upregulated 5\u03b1R1 levels in large versus small tumors. It is not clear what the mechanism is for the different response in the Post-Finasteride group. Post-Dutasteride treatment was more effective than Pre-Dutasteride treatment in decreasing 5\u03b1R1 in large tumors. Therefore, this may be why this treatment was more effective in decreasing PIN progression and PCa development.The effect of finasteride and dutasteride on these biomarkers did not clearly elucidate their mechanism of action, but tumor 5\u03b1R1 levels were significantly positively correlated with adjusted prostate severe lesion score."}

{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Evidence shows neurosteroids play a key role in regulating epileptogenesis. Neurosteroids such as testosterone modulate seizure susceptibility through its transformation to metabolites which show proconvulsant and anticonvulsant effects, respectively. Reduction of testosterone by aromatase generates proconvulsant 17-\u03b2 estradiol. Alternatively, testosterone is metabolized into 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (5\u03b1-DHT) by 5\u03b1-reductase, which is then reduced by 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme (3\u03b1-HSOR) to form anticonvulsant metabolite 3\u03b1-androstanediol (3\u03b1-Diol), a potent GABAA receptor modulating neurosteroid. The present study evaluated whether inhibition of aromatase inhibitor letrozole protects against seizures and neuronal degeneration induced by kainic acid (KA) (10\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) in Swiss albino mice. Letrozole (1\u202fmg/kg, i.p.) administered one hour prior to KA significantly increased the onset time of seizures and reduced the% incidence of seizures. Pretreatment with finasteride, a selective inhibitor of 5\u03b1-reductase and indomethacin, a selective inhibitor of 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme (3\u03b1-HSOR), reversed the protective effects of letrozole in KA-induced seizures in mice. Microscopic examination using cresyl violet staining revealed that letrozole did not modify KA-induced neurotoxicity in the CA1, CA3 and DG region of the hippocampus. Letrozole treatment resulted in the reduced levels of 17-\u03b2 estradiol and elevated the levels of 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 3\u03b1-Diol in the hippocampus. Finasteride and indomethacin attenuated letrozole-induced elevations of 5\u03b1-DHT and 3\u03b1-Diol. Our results indicate the potential anticonvulsant effects of letrozole against KA-induced seizures in mice that might be mediated by inhibiting aromatization of testosterone to 17\u03b2-estradiol, a proconvulsant hormone and by redirecting the synthesis to anticonvulsant metabolites, 5\u03b1-DHT and 3\u03b1-Diol. Acute aromatase inhibition, thus, might be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of status epilepticus and can be pursued further."}
{"keyword": "Finasteride", "texts": "Finasteride is currently used extensively for male androgenic alopecia and benign prostatic hyperplasia; however, some adverse effects are severe and even persistent after treatment cessation, the so-called 'post-finasteride syndrome'. The following most severe adverse effects-sexual dysfunction and depression-often occur together and may potentiate one other, a fact that could explain (at least in part) the magnitude and persistence of finasteride adverse effects. This paper presents the pharmacological action of finasteride and the corresponding adverse effects, the biological base explaining the occurrence, persistence and distribution of these adverse effects, and a possible therapeutic solution for post-finasteride syndrome. The distribution of finasteride adverse effects is presented within a comprehensive and modern neuro-endocrine perspective related to structural and informational dichotomies of the brain. Understanding the variation of finasteride side effects among different populations would be necessary not only to delineate the safety profile of finasteride for different subgroups of men (a subject may or may not be affected by a certain anti-hormonal compound dependent on the individual neuro-endocrine profile), but also as a possible premise for a therapeutic approach of finasteride adverse effects. Such therapeutic approach should include administration of exogenous hormones, which are deficient in men with post-finasteride syndrome, namely dihydrotestosterone (in right-handed men) or progesterone/dihydroprogesterone (in left-handed subjects)."}

Therapeutic approaches for BPH such as 5-\u03b1-reductase inhibitors and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents increase TGF \u03b21 expression in the prostatic tissue. Here, we investigated the effects of the 5-\u03b1-reductase inhibitor-finasteride-on rat ventral prostate tissue, especially with regard to the tissue distribution and gene expression of fibrillar collagens. Adult Wistar rats (n\u2009=\u200915) were treated with finasteride (25\u2009mg/kg/day) by subcutaneous injection for 7 and 30 days. Age-matched, vehicle-treated (n\u2009=\u200915) adult Wistar rats were used as control. Finasteride treatment reduced prostate size and increased the area of types I and III collagen fibers in the prostatic stroma. As expected, TGF \u03b21 mRNA expression was upregulated by finasteride treatment. However, COL1A1 and COL3A1 mRNA expressions decreased after both 7 and 30 days of finasteride treatment, suggesting that finasteride treatment promotes prostate parenchyma and stroma changes, which lead to the observed types I and III collagen remodeling without de novo collagen synthesis. The upregulation of TGF \u03b21 mRNA and protein associated with the 5-\u03b1-reductase inhibitor is more closely related to epithelial and stromal cell death pathways than to prostatic fibrosis."}

BPH-1 cells, alone or with fibroblasts (c-Jun+/+ or c-Jun-/-), were implanted subcutaneously in male nude mice who were then treated with finasteride. The degrees of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and sizes of the xenografts were determined. BPH-1 cells were grown alone or co-cultured with mouse fibroblasts in the presence of finasteride and the level of IGF-1 secreted into the medium by the fibroblasts was determined. The proliferation-associated signaling pathway in BPH-1 cells was also evaluated. Fibroblasts and c-Jun promoted xenograft growth, stimulated Ki-67 expression, and inhibited BPH-1 apoptosis. Finasteride did not induce the shrinkage of xenografts in the combined-grafted groups despite repressing Ki-67 expression and inducing cell apoptosis. The addition of c-Jun-/- fibroblasts did not promote xenograft growth. In the absence of c-Jun and fibroblasts, finasteride did not alter xenograft growth, Ki-67 expression, or cell apoptosis. The in vitro results demonstrated that when BPH-1 cells were grown in monoculture, treatment with finasteride did not induce cell death and stimulated the expression of pro-proliferative signaling molecules, while in the presence of fibroblasts containing c-Jun, finasteride treatment repressed epithelial cell proliferation, the level of IGF-1 in the medium, and the activation of downstream pro-proliferative signaling pathways. Taken together, our results suggest that fibroblasts, c-Jun, and IGF-1 play key roles in mediating stromal-epithelial interactions that are required for the therapeutic effects of finasteride in benign prostate epithelial cells."}

We aimed to evaluate regimens using either maraviroc, bortezomib, or post-transplantation cyclophosphamide for GvHD prophylaxis compared with controls receiving the combination of tacrolimus and methotrexate using a novel composite primary endpoint to identify the most promising intervention to be further tested in a phase 3 trial. METHODS:In this prospective multicentre phase 2 trial, adult patients aged 18-75 years who received reduced-intensity conditioning HCT were randomly assigned (1:1:1) by random block sizes to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days 3 and 4, followed by tacrolimus starting on day 5 and mycophenolate mofetil starting on day 5 at 15 mg/kg three times daily not to exceed 1 g from day 5 to day 35); tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib (bortezomib 1\u00b73 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 4, and 7 after HCT); or tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc (maraviroc 300 mg orally twice daily from day -3 to day 30 after HCT). Methotrexate was administered as a 15 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on day 1 and 10 mg/m2 intravenous bolus on days 3, 6, and 11 after HCT; tacrolimus was given intravenously at a dose of 0\u00b705 mg/kg twice daily (or oral equivalent) starting on day -3 (except the post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, as indicated), with a target level of 5-15 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was continued at least until day 90 and was tapered off by day 180. Each study group was compared separately to a contemporary non-randomised prospective cohort of patients (control group) who fulfilled the same eligibility criteria as the trial, but who were treated with tacrolimus and methotrexate at centres not participating in the trial. The primary endpoint (GvHD-free, relapse-free survival [GRFS]) was defined as the time from HCT to onset of grade 3-4 acute GvHD, chronic GvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression, disease relapse, or death. The study was analysed by modified intention to treat. The study is closed to accrual and this is the planned analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02208037. FINDINGS:Between Nov 17, 2014, and May 18, 2016, 273 patients from 31 US centres were randomly assigned to the three study arms: 89 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; 92 to tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc; 92 to tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; and six were excluded. Between Aug 1, 2014, and Sept 14, 2016, 224 controls received tacrolimus and methotrexate. Controls were generally well matched except for more frequent comorbidities than the intervention groups and a different distribution of types of conditioning regimens used. Compared with controls, the hazard ratio for GRFS was 0\u00b772 (90% CI 0\u00b754-0\u00b794; p=0\u00b7044) for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, 0\u00b798 (0\u00b776-1\u00b727; p=0\u00b792) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib, and 1\u00b710 (0\u00b786-1\u00b741; p=0\u00b749) for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. 238 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities: 12 (13%) had grade 3 and 67 (73%) grade 4 events with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; ten (11%) had grade 3 and 68 (76%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 18 (20%) had grade 3 and 63 (68%) had grade 4 events with tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc. The most common toxicities were haematological (77 [84%] for tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide; 73 [82%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and bortezomib; and 78 [85%] for tacrolimus, methotrexate, and maraviroc) and cardiac (43 [47%], 44 [49%], and 43 [47%], respectively). INTERPRETATION:Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and post-transplantation cyclophosphamide was the most promising intervention, yielding the best GRFS; this regimen is thus being prospectively compared with tacrolimus and methotrexate in a phase 3 randomised trial.

During the course of the pregnancy, the treatment with tacrolimus was continued because the patient's T helper type 1 (Th1) cell population remained at a high level following the achievement of pregnancy. The dose was increased during pregnancy because of the elevated Th1 cell count at 28-week gestation.

It remains to be determined if this is equally detrimental for liver transplant recipients. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between IPV in tacrolimus exposure and immune-mediated graft injury after liver transplantation. METHODS:For 326 liver transplant recipients, transplanted between 2000-2015, tacrolimus IPV was calculated from at least 5 tacrolimus trough samples obtained between month 6 and 18 after liver transplantation and expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV). Primary composite endpoint consisted of immune-mediated graft injury (chronic rejection, biopsy proven and suspected late-acute rejection) after month 6. Secondary outcomes were the association between tacrolimus IPV on (1) loss of renal function per year of follow-up and (2) cytomegalovirus viremia after month 6. RESULTS:Of the 326 included liver transplant recipients, 70 patients (21.5%) reached the primary endpoint. Median tacrolimus CV was 28%. There was no significant difference in reaching the primary composite endpoint between the low and high IPV group (p=0.068). MELD-score pre-transplantation and the number of acute rejections were identified as independent predictors for immune-mediated graft injury (p=0.049, p=0.016). A higher IPV in combination with a low kidney function at baseline (eGFR < 40\u2009ml/min) was associated with greater loss of renal function per year of follow-up (p=0.007). Tacrolimus variability was not associated with late cytomegalovirus viremia. CONCLUSION:High IPV in tacrolimus exposure beyond month 6 post-liver transplantation was not associated with immune-mediated graft injury."}

In the present study, we evaluated the proof of concept of a VAMS device by comparing the pharmacokinetic data of tacrolimus in rats among dried blood in VAMS, wet blood, and plasma. METHODS:Tacrolimus was administered orally, to rats, at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg. Only 10 \u03bcL aliquots of blood were absorbed by VAMS devices at designated time points. Tacrolimus was extracted with a methanol-water mixture (1:1, v/v) via sonication. Tacrolimus levels in wet blood (10 \u03bcL) and plasma (10 \u03bcL) were quantified after protein precipitation. RESULTS:Tacrolimus in VAMS devices was quantifiable from 0.2\u00a0ng/mL using high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometer. Accuracy and precision were within the acceptance criteria. Bland-Altman plots showed that tacrolimus concentrations in VAMS devices were similar to those in wet blood, regardless of tacrolimus levels. On the other hand, tacrolimus levels in plasma were different from those in VAMS devices, especially at lower concentrations, likely due to partition of tacrolimus to blood cells. However, pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable among the three matrices. CONCLUSIONS:Collectively, these findings suggest that the VAMS device can be a useful device for pharmacokinetic studies in rats."}

ANIMALS STUDIED:Thirty-two dogs (57 eyes) diagnosed with idiopathic KCS were included. Inclusion criteria were Schirmer Tear Test 1 (STT-1) values <15\u00a0mm/min and concurrent clinical signs such as ocular hyperemia and discharge. PROCEDURES:The animals were submitted to a randomized, open-label, 5-week study and divided into 3 treatment groups treated with the following ophthalmic solutions: (a) 0.1% oclacitinib, (b) 0.1% oclacitinib +0.01% tacrolimus, and (c) 0.01% tacrolimus. Eye drops were instilled twice daily (12-hour intervals). At each follow-up examination, STT-1, clinical signs, and potential drug side effects were assessed. RESULTS:Oclacitinib did not significantly improve STT-1 values or clinical scores. Tacrolimus alone and in combination with oclacitinib increased mean STT-1 values by 11.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 and 12.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3\u00a0mm/min, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Clinical scores of ocular discharge and hyperemia also improved significantly in both groups receiving treatment with tacrolimus (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, addition of oclacitinib to tacrolimus provided no additional improvement over tacrolimus alone. CONCLUSIONS:Topical 0.1% oclacitinib twice daily is not effective in controlling the ocular signs of KCS in dogs. 0.01% tacrolimus increased STT-1 values significantly and could potentially be used as a treatment for mild-to-moderate cases of KCS. Synergism between drugs did not occur, and therefore the use of oclacitinib is not justified in cases of canine KCS."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "Calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus, is a potent immunosuppressive drug widely used in order to prevent acute graft rejection. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most frequent infectious complication in renal transplant patients and long-term use of Tacrolimus might be involved in higher susceptibility to bacterial infections. It remains largely unknown how Tacrolimus affects the host innate immune response against lower and upper UTI. To address this issue, we used experimental UTI model by intravesical inoculation of uropathogenic E.coli in female wild-type mice pre-treated with Tacrolimus or solvent (CTR). We found that Tacrolimus pre-treated mice displayed higher bacterial loads (cystitis, pyelonephritis and bacteremia) than CTR mice. Granulocytes from Tacrolimus pre-treated mice phagocytized less E. coli, released less MPO and expressed decreased levels of CXCR2 receptor upon infection. Moreover, Tacrolimus reduced TLR5 expression in bladder macrophages during UTI. This immunosuppressive state can be explained by the upregulation of TLR-signaling negative regulators (A20, ATF3, IRAK-M and SOCS1) and parallel downregulation of TLR5 as observed in Tacrolimus treated granulocytes and macrophages. We conclude that Tacrolimus impairs host innate immune responses against UTI."}

Inadequate immunosuppression may lead to graft loss due to the presence of anti-HLA antibody. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of variability in tacrolimus blood concentration on anti-HLA antibody development in pediatric recipients of living-donor renal transplants. METHODS:Pediatric recipients of living-donor renal transplants were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with a minimum of two years of follow-up who were administered tacrolimus were included in the study. Patients who had pretransplant anti-HLA antibody were excluded. Variability in tacrolimus blood concentration was assessed using the coefficient of variation (\"tacrolimus CV\") method. Tacrolimus CV was calculated separately for the first 6\u00a0months post-transplant, between 6 and 12\u00a0months post-transplant, and from the end of the first year post-transplant to the last follow-up. We constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the tacrolimus CV for each group to find the best cutoff value. RESULTS:A total of 67 patients (including 48 males; 72%) with a mean age of 15.16\u2009\u00b1\u20094.43\u00a0years were included in the study. Anti-HLA antibody positivity was detected in 12 patients (18%). More than three HLA mismatches and the presence of acute cellular rejection correlated with the development of anti-HLA antibody (p\u2009=\u20090.056, 0.009). Tacrolimus CVs for the three periods were 0.37\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11, 0.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18, and 0.35\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12, respectively. The cutoff value of tacrolimus CV for anti-HLA antibody development was calculated as 0.32 with a sensitivity of 90.91% and specificity of 50.94% [AUC (area under the curve) 0.713, p = 0.023]. During the second 6-month period and after a \u00a0year post-transplant, the percentage of patients with tacrolimus CV\u2009>\u00a00.32 was significantly higher in the anti-HLA antibody positive group than in the antibody negative group (67% vs 31%, p = 0.027; 83% vs 47%, p = 0.033). The eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was similar for the anti-HLA antibody negative and positive groups (78.72\u2009\u00b1\u20092.86 vs 77.45\u2009\u00b1\u20098.08, p\u2009>\u20090.05).

Tacrolimus reduced the amplitude of Kv currents in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value and Hill coefficient of 7.80\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.01\u202f\u03bcM and 1.07\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25, respectively. Tacrolimus caused a shift in the activation curve toward a more positive potential and in the inactivation curve toward a more negative potential. Tacrolimus-induced inhibition of Kv current was increased by the application of train pulses (1 or 2\u202fHz). Furthermore, the recovery time constant of inactivation was extended in the presence of tacrolimus, suggesting that tacrolimus inhibited Kv channels in a use-dependent manner. Two kinds of Kv subtype inhibitors, DPO-1 and guangxitoxin did not affect the degree of tacrolimus-induced inhibition of Kv current. Furthermore, pretreatment with another calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A, did not affect the Kv current, and did not alter the inhibitory effect of tacrolimus. Using perforated-patch clamp experiments, inhibition of Kv channels by tacrolimus caused membrane depolarization. From these results, we concluded that tacrolimus inhibited the vascular Kv currents in a dose, state (open and closed)-dependent manner."}

Genetic factors have been found to play critical roles in determining tacrolimus pharmacokinetics. OBJECTIVE:We aimed to examine the association of donor and recipient Toll-like receptor (TLR) polymorphisms with tacrolimus elimination and the potential mechanism for TLR gene polymorphism-mediated tacrolimus metabolism. METHODS:Two independent cohorts including 297 patients receiving liver transplantation (LT) were enrolled in this study (cohort A was composed of 200 patients; cohort B included 97 patients and served as a validation set). Toll-like receptors polymorphisms were genotyped using TaqMan single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) assays. The protein expressions were detected by Western blotting. The metabolism assay was used to quantify tacrolimus elimination. The activity of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) was evaluated by luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS:Tacrolimus dose-adjusted trough blood concentrations (C/D) ratios were significantly lower for donor TLR9 rs352139 AG/GG carriers than AA carriers at weeks 1, 2, and 3 after LT. In multivariate analysis, donor and recipient CYP3A5 rs776746 and donor TLR9 rs352139 were independent predictors of tacrolimus C/D ratios in the early period after transplantation in both cohorts. When investigating the combined effects of donor CYP3A5 rs776746 and donor TLR9 rs352139 genotypes, the C/D ratios were remarkably significant at all time points during the first month after LT within the four groups. Furthermore, CYP3A5 mRNA expression in liver tissue was significantly higher for AG/GG patients than AA carriers after LT. In addition, we demonstrated that the TLR9 rs352139 genetic variant promotes tacrolimus metabolism of liver cells via upregulation of CYP3A5, which is dependent on the repression of NF-\u03baB/pregnane X receptor (PXR) signaling. CONCLUSIONS:Donor TLR9 rs352139 genetic variant facilitated tacrolimus elimination during the early stage after LT in Chinese patients, which might be related to the upregulation of CYP3A5 enzyme via the NF-kB/PXR signaling pathway."}

This study included 147 patients administered tacrolimus, including seventy-five patients in the discovery set and seventy-two patients in the replication set. The patient genomes in the discovery set were sequenced using WES. Also, known tacrolimus pharmacokinetics-related intron variants were genotyped. Tacrolimus C0/D was log-transformed. Sixteen variants were identified including novel CYP3A7 rs12360 and rs10211 by ANOVA. CYP3A7 rs2257401 was found to be the most significant variant among the periods by ANOVA. Seven variants including CYP3A7 rs2257401, rs12360, and rs10211 were analyzed by SNaPshot in the replication set and the effects on tacrolimus C0/D were verified. A linear mixed model (LMM) was further performed to account for the effects of the variants and clinical factors. The combined set LMM showed that only CYP3A7 rs2257401 was associated with tacrolimus C0/D after adjusting for patient age, albumin, and creatinine.

Nonad-herence and tacrolimus intrapatient variability have been identified as risk factors for developing de novo donor-specific antibodies. Tacrolimus, given once daily, can improve adherence and reduce variabilities among patients. The aim of this retrospective observational study was to compare the incidences of donor-specific antibodies at 2 years posttransplant in de novo kidney transplant recipients given tacrolimus either once or twice daily. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Non-HLA sensitized de novo kidney-transplant recipients given tacrolimus either once daily (n = 82) or twice daily (n = 168), combined with mycophenolic acid with or without steroids, were included in the study. All patients were screened for anti-HLA antibodies before transplant, at 6, 12, and 24 months posttransplant, and each time the patient presented with impaired kidney function. RESULTS:The 2-year incidence of donor-specific antibodies was 2.8%. During the follow-up period, 6 patients (3.6%) receiving tacrolimus twice daily and one patient (1.2%) receiving tacrolimus once daily developed a donor-specific antibody (P = .43). The incidence of antibody-mediated rejection was 4.8% under tacrolimus once daily and 2.7% under tacrolimus twice daily (P = .5). Tacrolimus intrapatient variability was similar with both formulations and was not associated with development of donor-specific antibodies. CONCLUSIONS:The use of tacrolimus-based immunosup-pression associated with mycophenolic acid was associated with a low risk of de novo donor-specific antibodies.

In vitro studies have shown that CsA inhibits BKV replication. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of switching from tacrolimus to low-dose CsA in renal transplant recipients with BKVN. Methods: Twenty-four patients diagnosed with BKVN between January 2015 and December 2016 were included. Tacrolimus was switched to low-dose CsA, and patients were followed for 24 months. Primary end points were BKV clearance in blood and graft. Secondary end points were urine specific gravity, serum creatinine, and graft loss. Results: The viremia in all patients cleared at a mean of 2.7 \u00b1 2.0 months after switching to CsA. Urine specific gravity at 3 months after switching to CsA increased significantly compared with that at diagnosis (P=0.002). The timing and trend of urine specific gravity increase was consistent with the timing and trend of blood and urine viral load decrease. Repeated biopsies at a median of 11.2 months (range: 9.1-12.5 months) after switching to CsA showed that 8 patients (42.1%) were negative for BKV, and 11 patients (58.9%) had a decrease in BKV load (P<0.001). There was no statistical difference in the serum creatinine level between the time of diagnosis and 24 months of CsA therapy (P=0.963). The graft survival rate was 100%.

Based on our recent report showing a positive correlation between fecal abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and oral tacrolimus dose in kidney transplant patients, we tested whether F. prausnitzii and other gut abundant bacteria are capable of metabolizing tacrolimus. Incubation of F. prausnitzii with tacrolimus led to production of two compounds (the major one named M1), which was not observed upon tacrolimus incubation with hepatic microsomes. Isolation, purification, and structure elucidation using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that M1 is a C-9 keto-reduction product of tacrolimus. Pharmacological activity testing using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that M1 is 15-fold less potent than tacrolimus as an immunosuppressant. Screening of 22 gut bacteria species revealed that most Clostridiales bacteria are extensive tacrolimus metabolizers. Tacrolimus conversion to M1 was verified in fresh stool samples from two healthy adults. M1 was also detected in the stool samples from kidney transplant recipients who had been taking tacrolimus orally. Together, this study presents gut bacteria metabolism as a previously unrecognized elimination route of tacrolimus, potentially contributing to the low and variable tacrolimus exposure after oral dosing."}

The association between model-predicted tacrolimus exposure metrics and standardized extrarenal AEs in stable renal transplant recipients was investigated and a limited sampling strategy (LSS) was developed to predict steady-state tacrolimus area under the curve over a 12-h dosing period (AUCss,0-12h ). METHODS:All recipients receiving tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid \u22656\u00a0months completed a 12-h cross-sectional observational pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study. Patients were evaluated for the presence of individual and composite gastrointestinal, neurological, and aesthetic AEs during the study visit. The associations between AEs and tacrolimus exposure metrics generated from a published population pharmacokinetic model were investigated using a logistic regression analysis in NONMEM 7.3. An LSS was determined using a Bayesian estimation method with the same patients. RESULTS:Dose-normalized tacrolimus AUCss,0-12h and apparent clearance were independently associated with diarrhoea, dyspepsia, insomnia and neurological AE ratio. Dose-normalized tacrolimus maximum concentration was significantly correlated with skin changes and acne. No AE associations were found with trough concentrations. Using limited sampling at 0, 2h; 0, 1, 4h; and 0, 1, 2, 4h provided a precise and unbiased prediction of tacrolimus AUC (root mean squared prediction error <\u00a010%), which was not well characterized using trough concentrations only (root mean squared prediction error >15%). CONCLUSIONS:Several AEs (i.e. diarrhoea, dyspepsia, insomnia and neurological AE ratio) were associated with tacrolimus dose normalized AUCss,0-12h and clearance. Skin changes and acne were associated with dose-normalized maximum concentrations. To facilitate clinical implementation, a LSS was developed to predict AUCss,0-12h values using sparse patient data to efficiently assess projected immunosuppressive exposure and potentially minimize AE manifestations."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this 8-year longitudinal cohort study of adult kidney transplant recipients, mycophenolate and tacrolimus levels were compared across transplant vintage stratified by non-African Americans versus African Americans. Data were analyzed with standard univariate tests and multivariable regression models. RESULTS:Our study included 1217 patients (transplanted from 2005-2013) who had tacrolimus and myco-phenolate exposure data, with follow-up through 2015 (53.7% were African Americans). Mean mycophenolate dose was 1672 \u00b1 463 mg/day during the first 3 years posttransplant. Although transplant vintage did not appreciably impact mycophenolate dosing in non-African Americans (0.7 mg/day/y; P = .903), doses significantly decreased in African Americans across transplant vintage (-20.5 mg/day/y; P < .001). Rate of mycophenolate being held or discontinued based on transplant vintage significantly increased in African Americans but did not change in non-African Americans. At the beginning of the study, mean tacrolimus levels were lower in African Americans; however, levels then slightly decreased in non-African Americans (-0.03 ng/mL/y; P = .279) and slightly increased in African Americans (+0.03 ng/mL/y; P = .247), with similar levels by 2013. Higher tacrolimus levels were protective against rejection in African Americans only but were protective against death-censored graft loss in both race/ethnicity groups. Mycophenolate dosing had no appreciable impact on outcomes in African Americans, but higher mycophenolate dosing was a significant risk factor for death-censored graft loss in non-African Americans. CONCLUSIONS:Tacrolimus and mycophenolate exposure levels have significantly changed over time and differed by race/ethnicity. In non-African Americans, those transplanted more recently tended to have lower tacrolimus but similar mycophenolate exposure. Although mycophenolate exposure in African Americans has recently decreased, tacrolimus has increased. Differences in outcomes likely reflect improved understanding of immunosuppressant tolerability by recipient race/ethnicity."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Tacrolimus is one of the most widely used liver transplant medications. With the increasing number of obese patients requiring liver transplants, knowledge of the effect of body size affecting post-transplant outcomes, for example drug exposure is increasingly required. AIMS:(i) To investigate whether patient body size (i.e. total bodyweight) affects trough plasma concentrations of tacrolimus when a standard mg/kg dosing regimen is used; and (ii) to investigate whether obese patients have different numbers of plasma concentrations outside the therapeutic range compared to non-obese patients in the first months after liver transplant. METHODS:Using a transplant database, data tacrolimus concentrations were available for 69 patients. Tacrolimus was initially dosed at a standard 0.1 mg/kg/day after liver transplant, and adjusted to maintain a target trough concentration. Trough blood samples, phenotypic and outcome variables were analysed. RESULTS:Trough concentrations were similar between obese and non-obese patients (P > 0.05) at each sampling day. At day 7 post-transplant, 85.7% and 79.5% of the observed plasma concentrations were outside the recommended therapeutic range for obese and non-obese patients respectively, at day 30, 52.9% and 57.4%, and at 6 months, 18.7% and 27.5%. CONCLUSION:In the first week post-transplant, tacrolimus trough concentrations after standard mg/kg dosing post liver transplant appear to be corrected by total bodyweight. Obese patients have a similar number of trough plasma concentrations outside the therapeutic range compared to non-obese patients."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "TRPM8 is a polymodal, nonselective cation channel activated by cold temperature and cooling agents that plays a critical role in the detection of environmental cold. We found that TRPM8 is a pharmacological target of tacrolimus (FK506), a macrolide immunosuppressant with several clinical uses, including the treatment of organ rejection following transplants, treatment of atopic dermatitis, and dry eye disease. Tacrolimus is an inhibitor of the phosphatase calcineurin, an action shared with cyclosporine. Tacrolimus activates TRPM8 channels in different species, including humans, and sensitizes their response to cold temperature by inducing a leftward shift in the voltage-dependent activation curve. The effects of tacrolimus on purified TRPM8 in lipid bilayers demonstrates conclusively that it has a direct gating effect. Moreover, the lack of effect of cyclosporine rules out the canonical signaling pathway involving the phosphatase calcineurin. Menthol (TRPM8-Y745H)- and icilin (TRPM8-N799A)-insensitive mutants were also activated by tacrolimus, suggesting a different binding site. In cultured mouse DRG neurons, tacrolimus evokes an increase in intracellular calcium almost exclusively in cold-sensitive neurons, and these responses were drastically blunted in Trpm8 KO mice or after the application of TRPM8 antagonists. Cutaneous and corneal cold thermoreceptor endings are also activated by tacrolimus, and tacrolimus solutions trigger blinking and cold-evoked behaviors. Together, our results identify TRPM8 channels in sensory neurons as molecular targets of the immunosuppressant tacrolimus. The actions of tacrolimus on TRPM8 resemble those of menthol but likely involve interactions with other channel residues.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT TRPM8 is a polymodal TRP channel involved in cold temperature sensing, thermoregulation, and cold pain. TRPM8 is also involved in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, and TRPM8 activation has antiallodynic and antipruritic effects, making it a prime therapeutic target in several cutaneous and neural diseases. We report the direct agonist effect of tacrolimus, a potent natural immunosuppressant with multiple clinical applications, on TRPM8 activity. This interaction represents a novel neuroimmune interface. The identification of a clinically approved drug with agonist activity on TRPM8 channels could be used experimentally to probe the function of TRPM8 in humans. Our findings may explain some of the sensory and anti-inflammatory effects described for this drug in the skin and the eye surface."}

METHODS:A total of 707 tacrolimus concentrations from 107 adult heart transplant patients were included in model development. The effects of demographic, clinical factors and CYP3A5 genotype on tacrolimus clearance were evaluated using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. 24 patients with 106 tacrolimus concentrations were used for external validation. RESULTS:The pharmacokinetic data were adequately described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. The estimated apparent clearance and volume of distribution of tacrolimus were 13.7 l/h and 791 l, respectively. Tacrolimus apparent clearance was significantly reduced in CYP3A5 nonexpressers (CYP3A5*3/*3), concomitant with azole antifungal drugs and Wuzhi capsule (WZ). A predictive performance was further confirmed in an external validation by Bayesian estimation. Recommended dose regimens were obtained by simulations based on the established model. CONCLUSION:This is the first population pharmacokinetic study conducted in Chinese heart transplant recipients. These findings are of great importance with regards to tacrolimus dose optimization in heart transplantation patients."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Tacrolimus, a major immunosuppressant used after transplantation, is associated with large interindividual variation involving genetic polymorphisms in metabolic processes. A common variant of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 gene, CYP3A5*3, affects blood concentrations of tacrolimus. However, tacrolimus pharmacokinetics at the early stage of transplantation have not been adequately studied in heart transplantation. We retrospectively examined the impact of the CYP3A5 genotype on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics at the early stage of heart transplantation. METHODS:The tacrolimus pharmacokinetic profile was obtained from 65 patients during the first 5\u00a0weeks after heart transplantation. Differences in the patients' characteristics and tacrolimus pharmacokinetic parameters between the CYP3A5 expresser (*1/*1 or *1/*3 genotypes) and non-expresser (*3/*3 genotype) groups were assessed by the Chi-square test, Student's t test, or Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS:The CYP3A5 *1/*1, *1/*3, and *3/*3 genotypes were detected in 5, 22, and 38 patients, respectively. All patients started clotrimazole therapy approximately 1\u00a0week after starting tacrolimus. Apparent clearance and dose/weight to reach the target trough concentration (C0) were significantly higher in the expresser group than in the non-expresser group (0.32 vs. 0.19 L/h/kg, p\u2009=\u20090.0003;\u00a00.052 vs. 0.034\u00a0mg/kg/day, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002); there were no significant differences in the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 12\u00a0h (AUC0-12)\u00a0and concentrations at any sampling time point between the two groups. CONCLUSION:Similar concentration-time curves for tacrolimus were obtained in the expresser and non-expresser groups by dose adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring. These results demonstrate the importance of the CYP3A5 genotype in tacrolimus dose optimization based on therapeutic drug monitoring after heart transplantation."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "Background Dried blood spots (DBSs) could allow patients to prepare their own samples at home and send them to the laboratory for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of immunosuppressants. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current knowledge about the impact of DBS-related preanalytical factors on TDM of tacrolimus, sirolimus and everolimus. Content Blood spot volume, blood spot inhomogeneity, stability of analytes in DBS and hematocrit (Hct) effects are considered important DBS-related preanalytical factors. In addition, the influence of drying time has recently been identified as a noteworthy preanalytical factor. Tacrolimus is not significantly influenced by these factors. Sirolimus and everolimus are more prone to heat degradation and exhibited variations in recovery which were dependent on Hct and drying time. Summary and outlook DBS-related preanalytical factors can have a significant impact on TDM for immunosuppressants. Tacrolimus is not significantly influenced by the studied preanalytical factors and is a viable candidate for DBS sampling. For sirolimus and everolimus more validation of preanalytical factors is needed. In particular, drying conditions need to be examined further, as current protocols may mask Hct-dependent effects on recovery. Further validation is also necessary for home-based self-sampling of immunosuppressants as the sampling quality is variable."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:There is paucity of data on alternative drug therapies for patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Tacrolimus (TAC) is a promising salvage agent. We present a review of TAC therapy in AIH patients. METHODS:A search for studies with keywords 'autoimmune hepatitis' and 'tacrolimus' was performed. Reviews, studies of AIH post-transplant and AIH in children were excluded. Diagnosis of AIH was based on criteria established by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group. Complete biochemical response was defined as normalisation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST <45) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT <50). No biochemical response was defined as failure to return to normalisation at the end of follow-up. Demographic information and details of pre- and post-treatment liver biopsy were collected. RESULTS:Seven articles achieved the inclusion criteria and reported data for a total of 162 adult patients. The majority of studies reported average ages approximately 35 years old. Treatment duration ranged from 1 to 136 months. Indications for therapy were mostly AIH refractory to steroid treatment or inability to tolerate standard steroid treatment. Eighty-three patients (51.2%) were reported to have pre-therapy liver biopsy. Of 49 patients for whom stage was reported, 6 patients were stage 1, 16 were stage 2, 14 were stage 3 and 13 were stage 4. Of 40 patients for whom grade was reported, 1 patient was grade 0, 3 were grade 1, 9 were grade 2, 14 were grade 3 and 13 were grade 4. Dosing regimens were between 1 and 8\u2009mg/day. Target trough TAC serum concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 10.7\u2009ng/mL TAC was discontinued in 28 (17.3%) patients for various reasons. Renal function remained stable in most patients. One hundred and twenty-one patients (74.7%) demonstrated complete biochemical response to treatment. Post-therapy liver biopsy was obtained for 30 (18.5%) patients, and 25 (15.4%) of these patients were noted to have histological remission according to the grade of inflammation or stage of fibrosis. CONCLUSION:TAC is relatively effective in the treatment of AIH refractory to traditional therapy. It appears that liver function can be enhanced at a minimal cost to renal function. Key Points There is a cohort of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) who do not respond to standard therapy. Alternative treatment options for these patients have been explored, but outcomes have not been comprehensively examined. We report the use and efficacy of tacrolimus (TAC) in patients with AIH. We found that TAC can be safely and effectively used in patients with AIH with minimal side effects. TAC can be a potential treatment option for patients with AIH refractory to standard therapy."}

We previously demonstrated that patients with MuSK-MG have increased pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses. Tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant used in AChR-MG and transplantation patients, inhibits T cell responses through interference with IL-2 transcription. The therapeutic efficacy and immunological effect of tacrolimus in MuSK-MG is unclear. In the current study we examined the proliferation, phenotype and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MuSK-MG following a 3-day in vitro culture with or without tacrolimus. We determined that tacrolimus profoundly suppressed CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and significantly suppressed Th1 and Th17 responses, as demonstrated by a reduced frequency of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-17 producing CD4 T cells and reduced frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 producing CD8 T cells. Tacrolimus also inhibits pathogenic Th17 cells coproducing IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3. In addition, tacrolimus suppressed follicular T helper cell (Tfh) and regulatory T helper cell (Treg) subsets. These findings provide preliminary support for tacrolimus as a potential alternative immunosuppressive therapy for MuSK-MG."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Tacrolimus is the mainstay of immunosuppression in renal transplantation. Given that once-daily administration improves patient compliance, 1:1 dose conversion from twice-daily Prograf\u00ae to once-daily Advagraf\u00ae is recommended. Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5 and multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) polymorphisms influence tacrolimus concentrations, it is unknown if these impact on conversion. This study investigated the change in the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus after conversion from Prograf\u00ae to Advagraf\u00ae and examined the impact of CYP3A5 and MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms on those pharmacokinetics. METHODS:A prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of 1:1 conversion from Prograf\u00ae to Advagraf\u00ae with or without diltiazem was conducted on 26 stable renal transplant recipients. Blood samples were collected over 24\u00a0h during each phase, tacrolimus concentrations were assayed, and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed. All participants were genotyped for CYP3A5*3 and MDR1 C3435T. RESULTS:After conversion, without diltiazem, the area under the concentration-time curve at steady state from 0 to 24 h after dose administration (AUCss, 0-24) was significantly reduced [median\u00a0224 (range\u00a0172-366) vs. 184 (104-347) ng\u00b7h/mL, p\u2009=\u20090.006, n\u2009=\u200926]. A decrease in tacrolimus exposure (median 21%) was only evident among CYP3A5 expressors [227 (172-366) vs. 180 (104-347) ng\u00b7h/mL, p\u2009=\u20090.014, n\u2009=\u200918], not among non-expressors [215 (197-290) vs. 217 (129-281) ng\u00b7h/mL, p\u2009=\u20090.263, n\u2009=\u20098]. In contrast, among CYP3A5 expressors receiving diltiazem, AUCss, 0-24 did not change significantly upon conversion [229 (170-296) vs. 221 (123-342) ng\u00b7h/mL, p\u2009=\u20090.575, n\u2009=\u200910]. An independent effect was not evident for MDR1 C3435T polymorphism. CONCLUSION:The high prevalence of CYP3A5 polymorphism among Asians may lead to a significant reduction in tacrolimus exposure with 1:1 dose conversion of Prograf\u00ae to Advagraf\u00ae. These results advocate for CYP3A5 determination prior to conversion, and suggest that 1:1.25 conversion should be used for CYP3A5 expressors and 1:1 conversion for other patients."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Tacrolimus is the mainstay calcineurin inhibitor frequently administered with mycophenolic acid with or without corticosteroids to prevent graft rejection in adult kidney transplant recipients. The primary objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a population pharmacokinetic model characterizing immediate-release oral tacrolimus co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil (a pro-drug of mycophenolic acid) in adult kidney transplant recipients on corticosteroid-free regimens. The secondary objective was to investigate the effects of clinical covariates on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, emphasizing the interacting effects of mycophenolic acid. METHODS:Population modeling and evaluation were conducted with Monolix (Suite-2018R1) using the stochastic approximation expectation-maximization algorithm in 49 adult subjects (a total of 320 tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations). Effects of clinical variables on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics were determined by population covariate modeling, regression modeling, and categorical analyses. RESULTS:A two-compartment, first-order absorption with a lag-time, linear elimination, and constant error model best represented the population pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. The apparent clearance value for tacrolimus was 17.9\u00a0l/h (6.95% relative standard error) in our model, which is lower compared with similar subjects on corticosteroid-based therapy. The glomerular filtration rate had significant effects on the apparent clearance and central compartment volume of distribution. Conversely, mycophenolic acid did not affect the apparent clearance of tacrolimus. CONCLUSION:We have developed and internally evaluated a novel population pharmacokinetic model for tacrolimus co-administered with mycophenolate mofetil in corticosteroid-free adult kidney transplant patients. These findings are clinically important and provide further reasons for conducting therapeutic drug monitoring in this specific population."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Isavuconazole, a triazole antifungal, is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which also metabolizes tacrolimus and sirolimus. In previous studies, isavuconazole administration increased tacrolimus and sirolimus area under the curve values by 2.3-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively, in healthy adults and tacrolimus concentration/dose (C/D) ratio by 1.3-fold in solid organ transplant patients. We aimed to determine the magnitude of effect of isavuconazole administration on tacrolimus and sirolimus C/D ratios in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (alloHSCT) patients. METHODS:A retrospective, single-center, single-arm study in adult alloHSCT patients who received at least 10\u00a0days of combination therapy with isavuconazole and tacrolimus and/or sirolimus as inpatients or outpatients was conducted. Tacrolimus and sirolimus trough serum concentrations were measured up to twice weekly for up to 4\u00a0weeks. RESULTS:Twenty-two patients receiving tacrolimus and twenty patients receiving sirolimus met the inclusion criteria. The mean C/D ratio increased from baseline by 1.42-fold for tacrolimus during week 1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and up to 1.56-fold for sirolimus during week 2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). For the remaining timepoints, tacrolimus and sirolimus C/D ratios were not statistically significantly different from baseline. CONCLUSION:In alloHSCT patients, modest increases in tacrolimus and sirolimus C/D ratios from baseline were observed within the first 2\u00a0weeks after initiation of isavuconazole."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Tacrolimus is an important immunosuppressive agent with high intra- and inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and a narrow therapeutic index. As tacrolimus extensively accumulates in erythrocytes, hematocrit is a key factor in the interpretation of tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. However, as hematocrit values in pediatric kidney transplant patients are highly variable after kidney transplantation, translating whole blood concentration targets without taking hematocrit into consideration is theoretically incorrect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential impact of hematocrit correction on tacrolimus target exposure in pediatric kidney transplant patients. METHODS:Data were obtained from 36 pediatric kidney transplant patients. Two hundred fifty-five tacrolimus whole blood samples were available, together responsible for 36 area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) and trough concentrations. First, hematocrit corrected concentrations were derived using a formula describing the relationship between whole blood concentrations, hematocrit, and plasma concentrations. Subsequently, target exposure was evaluated using the converted plasma target concentrations. Ultimately, differences in interpretation of target exposure were identified and evaluated. RESULTS:In total, 92% of our patients had lower hematocrit (median 0.29) than the reference value of adult kidney transplant patients. A different evaluation of target exposure for either trough level, AUC, or both was defined in 42% of our patients, when applying hematocrit corrected concentrations. CONCLUSION:A critical role for hematocrit in therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus in pediatric kidney transplant patients is suggested in this study. Therefore, we believe that hematocrit correction could be a step towards improvement of tacrolimus dose individualization."}

Kidney transplant patients (>18 years old) receiving oral tacrolimus treatment were included in the current study. The population pharmacokinetic model was built using a one-compartment model and the First Order Conditional Estimation method with Interaction (FOCEI via NONMEM v.7.3.). A total of 600 tacrolimus trough blood concentrations from 52 kidney transplant patients were analysed. Tacrolimus clearances were 26, 18.8 and 12.3 L/h, for patients with genetic polymorphisms CYP3A5*1*1, *1*3 and *3*3, respectively. The influence of haematocrit was inversely related to tacrolimus clearance, following an allometric power function. Total volume of distribution was 604 L. Interindividual variability associated with tacrolimus clearance and distribution volume for the final model was 33 and 63%, respectively, with a residual error of 2.5 ng/mL. Relative bioavailability was calculated between generic formulations A (0.53) and B (1) of tacrolimus. Internal validation was performed through bootstrap analysis to evaluate the stability of the final model; external validation was performed in a new group of patients (n = 13) to estimate residual errors on basic (57.8%) and final (34.8%) models. Finally, stochastic simulations were performed to propose a dosage regimen based on haematocrit, CYP3A5 genotype and generic formulation of tacrolimus. A stable and predictive population pharmacokinetic model of tacrolimus was developed for Mexican adult kidney transplant patients; additionally, the proposed dosage regimen of tacrolimus should be prospectively validated."}

The sources of variability have been investigated using population pharmacokinetic modeling over the last 2 decades. This article provides an updated synopsis on published nonlinear mixed-effects analyses developed for tacrolimus in transplant recipients. The objectives were to establish a detailed overview of the current data and to investigate covariate relationships determined by the models. Sixty-three published analyses were reviewed, and data regarding the study design, modeling approach, and resulting findings were extracted and summarized. Most of the studies investigated tacrolimus pharmacokinetics in adult and pediatric renal and liver transplants after administration of the immediate-release formulation. Model structures largely depended on the study sampling strategy, with \u223c50% of studies developing a 1-compartment model using trough concentrations and a 2-compartment model with delayed absorption from intensive sampling. The CYP3A5 genotype, as a covariate, consistently impacted tacrolimus clearance, and dosing adjustments were required to achieve similar drug exposure among patients. Numerous covariates were identified as sources of interindividual variability on tacrolimus pharmacokinetics with limited consistency across these studies, which may be the result of the study designs. Additional analyses are required to further evaluate the potential impact of these covariates and the clinical implementation of these models to guide tacrolimus dosing recommendations. This article may be useful for guiding the design of future population pharmacokinetic studies and provides recommendations for the selection of an existing optimal model to individualize tacrolimus therapy."}

This study aimed to investigate the association of variants in genes encoding the binding protein and the drug target (calcineurin) of tacrolimus with the efficacy in IMN patients and the potential mechanism. Sixty-seven IMN patients treated with tacrolimus were enrolled retrospectively. Sanger sequencing was performed to search for variants in all exons of the genes in 8 IMN patients and genotype for the detected variants in the other 59 patients. The molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between the variants and the efficacy was explored in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other cell lines. Single nucleotide polymorphism rs875 (T\u202f>\u202fC) in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of PPP3R1 encoding calcineurin regulatory subunit was found to be associated with the treatment efficacy of tacrolimus for IMN. Patients carrying TT genotype had a significantly higher remission rate than those carrying TC/CC genotype (83% vs. 47%, P\u202f=\u202f0.008). Western blot showed that the TT genotype carriers exhibited reduced PPP3R1 protein levels in PBMCs (P\u202f=\u202f0.02). Compared with C allele, T allele displayed increased binding affinity for miR-582-5p in the luciferase reporter assay (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Moreover, knockdown of PPP3R1 in Jurkat T cell line enhanced the immunosuppressive effect of tacrolimus. Our study revealed the association of PPP3R1 3'UTR polymorphism rs875 with the efficacy of tacrolimus in IMN patients. The functional polymorphism might alter PPP3R1 expression via modulating the interaction of miR-582-5p with PPP3R1, which further affected the immunosuppressive effect of tacrolimus."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "Membrane transporters play an essential role in the pharmacokinetics of drugs as they mediate exchanges between biological compartments. Tacrolimus is characterized by wide interpatient variability in terms of its pharmacokinetics that may in part be due to genetic factors. The pharmacogenetics of drug transporters is therefore a promising area to explore in the clinical pharmacology of tacrolimus. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of currently available data regarding the pharmacogenetics of membrane transporters that may be involved in the interindividual variability of the response to tacrolimus. Several genetic variants in genes coding for influx or efflux membrane transporters (e.g. ABCB1, ABCC2, ABCC8, SLC30A8, SLCO1B1/3, SLC28A1, SLC22A11, and SLC28A3) have been associated with tacrolimus pharmacokinetics variability or the occurrence of toxicity; however, there is still a degree of controversy as to the impact of these variants in vivo and further investigations are needed to confirm these results in larger cohorts and to validate the relevance of such genetic biomarkers for personalization of immunosuppressive therapy in solid organ transplantations. The relationship between transporter polymorphisms and the intracellular concentration of tacrolimus should also be further investigated. Finally, the main challenge could be elucidation of the interplay of biological mechanisms underlying genetic variations that alter the drug concentration or its clinical effect."}

Based on our recent report showing a positive correlation between fecal abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and oral tacrolimus dose in kidney transplant patients, we tested whether F. prausnitzii and other gut abundant bacteria are capable of metabolizing tacrolimus. Incubation of F. prausnitzii with tacrolimus led to production of two compounds (the major one named M1), which was not observed upon tacrolimus incubation with hepatic microsomes. Isolation, purification, and structure elucidation using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicated that M1 is a C-9 keto-reduction product of tacrolimus. Pharmacological activity testing using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated that M1 is 15-fold less potent than tacrolimus as an immunosuppressant. Screening of 22 gut bacteria species revealed that most Clostridiales bacteria are extensive tacrolimus metabolizers. Tacrolimus conversion to M1 was verified in fresh stool samples from two healthy adults. M1 was also detected in the stool samples from kidney transplant recipients who had been taking tacrolimus orally. Together, this study presents gut bacteria metabolism as a previously unrecognized elimination route of tacrolimus, potentially contributing to the low and variable tacrolimus exposure after oral dosing."}

However, in these models, oral administration is often problematic due to the lowered compliance associated with highly invasive surgery and due to malabsorption in the intestinal tract. Therefore, we carried out a study to determine the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus after intramuscular (IM) injection and to determine the optimal IM dosing regimens in primate models. Six male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were used in the study. Doses of 0.1\u00a0mg/kg and 5\u00a0mg were administered via IM injection and oral administration, respectively, once to determine single-dose pharmacokinetics and once daily for 5 days to determine multiple-dose pharmacokinetics. According to pharmacokinetic model estimates, the inter- and intra-individual variabilities in bioavailability following IM injection were remarkably reduced compared with those following oral administration. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that Cpeak, Ctrough and AUC would also have less variability following IM injection compared with oral administration. In this study, we found that the pharmacokinetic characteristics of tacrolimus were more constant following IM injection compared with oral administration. These results suggest that IM injection can be an alternative route of administration fin non-human primate model studies."}
{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "AIMS:Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid dosing after renal transplantation is individualized through therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Home-based dried blood spot (DBS) sampling has the potential to replace conventional TDM sampling at the clinic. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay was developed to quantify tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid in DBS and clinically validated for abbreviated area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) monitoring using an innovative volumetric DBS sampling device. METHODS:Clinical validation was performed by direct comparison of paired DBS and whole blood (WB) (tacrolimus) and plasma (mycophenolic acid) concentrations and AUCs. Agreement was evaluated using Passing-Bablok regression, Bland-Altman analysis and DBS-to-WB predictive performance. TDM dosing recommendations based on both methods were compared to assess clinical impact. RESULTS:Paired tacrolimus (n = 200) and mycophenolic acid (n = 192) DBS and WB samples were collected from 65 kidney(-pancreas) transplant recipients. Differences for tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid were within \u00b120% for 84.5% and 76.6% of concentrations and 90.5% and 90.7% of AUCs, respectively. Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid dosing recommendation differences occurred on 44.4% and 4.7% of occasions. Tacrolimus DBS dosing recommendations were 0.35 \u00b1 0.14\u00a0mg higher than for WB and 8 \u00b1 3% of the initial dose. Mycophenolic acid DBS dosing recommendations were 23.3 \u00b1 31.9\u00a0mg lower than for plasma and 2 \u00b1 3.5% of the initial dose. CONCLUSIONS:Tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid TDM for outpatient renal transplant recipients, based on abbreviated AUC collected with a DBS sampling device, is comparable to conventional TDM based on WB sampling. Patient training and guidance on good blood-spotting practices is essential to ensure method feasibility."}

A part of the PBMCs penetrates the graft. AIM:To examine if the choice of immunosuppression may change TLR4ex and how TLR4ex affects the transplant function in the future. MATERIAL:The study population-143 transplanted patients (pts) (55 females, 88 males), mean age on recruitment day 50.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.8\u202fyears old, mean BMI 25.04\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.18. 41 pts. experienced delayed graft function (DGF+). 55 pts. were treated with cyclosporine A (CsA) and 88 with tacrolimus (Tac). All were treated with mofetil mycophenolate (MMF). The PBMCs acquisition and starting point of the follow-up (TLR-day) was at least one month after KT. METHOD:We investigated averaged mRNA expression of Toll-like receptors 4 (TLR4ex) in non-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction. The KT pts. (All, Tac, CsA, DGF+) were divided by the respective median of their TLR4ex (lower: L-TLR4ex, higher: H-TLR4ex). Main clinical parameters and transplant biopsy files (if available) were assessed on TLR-day and post follow-up. RESULTS:We found that TLR4ex was reduced for a long time in patients who experienced delayed graft function. L-TLR4ex had a higher proportion of DGF+ patients, and patients treated with CsA but lower of those treated with Tac than in H-TLR4ex. The amplitude of changes in renal function parameters (\u0394EGFR%/\u0394sCr/\u0394sCr%) was clearly less favorable for L-TLR4ex. Tacrolimus expressed a stabilizing effect. Both the positive vasculitis score and chronic graft nephropathy were more frequent in the L-TLR4ex group. On TLR-day an association of renal function and Tac concentration with TLR4ex was clear only in the tacrolimus population. The TLR4ex was lower in patients with a future deterioration of the graft function. CONCLUSION:In kidney transplant recipients the occurrence of DGF results in a long-term reduction of the averaged TLR4ex in PBMC. Tacrolimus exerts a clear, stabilizing, positive and dose-dependent effect on TLR4ex. An improvement in renal transplant function may be expected in KT patients with high TLR4ex. Evaluation of the averaged TLR4ex can be used to assess the efficacy of immunosuppression in the treatment with tacrolimus and to estimate the likelihood of deterioration in renal function."}

Study A (ten patients) included the collection of several paired oral fluid samples by passive drool over a 12-h post-dose period. Study B (36 patients) included the collection of oral fluids pre-dose and at 2\u00a0h after the tacrolimus dose under three conditions: un-stimulated, after stimulation with a tart candy, and after mouth rinsing. The tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids was measured by a specially developed sensitive and specific liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method. A salivary transferrin concentration of >1\u00a0mg/dL was used as a cut-off value for oral fluid blood contamination.Rinsing the oral cavity before sampling proved to provide the most suitable sampling strategy giving a correlation coefficient value of 0.71 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) between the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids and the tacrolimus concentration in whole blood at trough. Mean and 95% confidence interval of tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids at the pre-dose concentration for samples collected after mouth rinsing was 584 (436, 782) pg/mL. The ratio of the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids to the tacrolimus concentration in whole blood (*100) was 11% (95% confidence interval 9-13) for all sampling times. Oral fluid pH or weight of a saliva sample did not influence the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids. Tacrolimus distribution into oral fluids exhibited a delay with a pronounced counter-clockwise hysteresis with respect to the time after dose. A multivariate analysis of variance revealed that the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids is related to the tacrolimus concentration in whole blood and tacrolimus plasma-binding proteins including albumin and cholesterol.An optimal sampling strategy for the determination of the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids was established. Measuring the tacrolimus concentration in oral fluids appears to be a feasible and non-invasive method for predicting the concentration of tacrolimus in whole blood."}

A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed as t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was performed. Cyclosporine was given for GVHD prophylaxis in addition to the other routine medications of HSCT. She was hospitalized for acute renal failure and due to the possible contribution of acute renal failure cyclosporine was stopped. Tacrolimus was started for GVHD prophylaxis at a dose of 1 mg/day. However, fifteen days after the initiation of tacrolimus, blurred vision occurred in our patient. Petechial bleeding sites were detected in bilateral cerebral and cerebellar hemisphere by MR imaging. Tacrolimus dosage was reduced to 0.5 mg/day. She had hypertension which was difficult to control and followed-up in the intensive care unit. She had seizures. Control cranial MR resulted as diffusion limitation in bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, bilateral occipital and frontal-parietal regions with vasogenic edema findings; contrast involvement in left frontal-parietal and right cerebellar regions. She had vision loss and lethargy. Control cranial MR favored PRES syndrome secondary to immunosuppression. Hypertensive state was taken under control with antihypertensive treatment and all immunosuppressive agents were stopped. Two weeks later her clinical condition was slightly improved. MR test which was conducted 2 weeks after the diagnosis revealed the regression of PRES lesions. The characteristic signs on neuroimaging are the symmetrical white matter edema in the posterior cerebral hemispheres, particularly the parietal- occipital regions. In conclusion, PRES rarely develops secondary to the immunosuppressive agents and the clinicians should suspect and promptly diagnose PRES which might cause otherwise serious irreversible clinical complications."}

The significant impact of CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms on tacrolimus exposure has been reported. Conflicting results of the additional influence of POR*28 polymorphisms on tacrolimus pharmacokinetic interindividual variability have been observed among different populations. The objective of this study was to explore the interaction between POR*28 and CYP3A5*3 polymorphisms and their main effects on tacrolimus trough concentration to dose ratios on day 7 after kidney transplantation.Two hundred sixteen adult kidney transplant recipients participated in this retrospective study. All participants received a twice daily tacrolimus regimen. Blood samples and data were collected on day 7 after transplantation. A 2-way analysis of covariance was performed.

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Tacrolimus is a cornerstone of immunosuppression after transplantation but is highly susceptible to changes from interacting variables and has a narrow therapeutic index. Clotrimazole troches are commonly used as a non-systemic antifungal to prevent oral candidiasis. Studies suggest that clotrimazole troches, though minimally absorbed systemically, may affect tacrolimus concentrations by inhibition of metabolic enzyme activity in the intestines. However, the magnitude of the impact of clotrimazole on tacrolimus dosing requirements to maintain goal levels is not well described. METHODS:To assess this, tacrolimus dose adjustments and trough concentrations were retrospectively examined in 95 heart transplant recipients before and after the discontinuation of clotrimazole. RESULTS:The median percent tacrolimus dose change was an increase of 66.7% (IQR 28.6%, 100%) after clotrimazole discontinuation, and the median trough concentration percent change from baseline to the first trough after clotrimazole discontinuation (in the absence of a dose change) was -42.5% (IQR -52.3%, -30.9%). Five cases of allograft rejection were observed. CONCLUSION:In conclusion, clotrimazole troches exert a meaningful interaction with tacrolimus that requires close monitoring and dose adjustment. The data from this single-center study provide novel information that could guide providers on the degree of tacrolimus dose adjustment needed when discontinuing clotrimazole prophylaxis after heart transplantation."}

There are robust pre-clinical data supporting a potential role for neuromodulatory agents in this patient population. This study assessed tacrolimus in improving erectile function recovery rates after RP (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00106392). AIM:To define the utility of oral tacrolimus in improving erectile function recovery after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. METHODS:A randomized, double-blind trial compared tacrolimus 2-3 mg daily and placebo in men undergoing RP. Patients had localized prostate cancer and excellent baseline erectile function, underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RP, and were followed up for at least 18 months after RP. Patients received study drug for 27 weeks and completed the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain (EFD) questionnaire at baseline and serially after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain score. RESULTS:Data were available for 124 patients (59 tacrolimus, 65 placebo); mean age was 54.6 \u00b1 6.2 years. No patient experienced permanent creatinine or potassium elevation. At baseline, mean EFD scores were 28.6 \u00b1 2.1 (tacrolimus group) and 29 \u00b1 1.5 (placebo group). By week 5, mean EFD scores had dropped to 8 \u00b1 9.4 (tacrolimus) and 9 \u00b1 10.7 (placebo). At 18 months, mean EFD scores were 16.0 \u00b1 11.3 (tacrolimus) and 20.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0 (placebo) (P\u00a0= .09). Tacrolimus failed to meet significance (hazard ratio\u00a0= 0.83; P\u00a0= .50), with no difference in: (i) percentage of patients achieving normal spontaneous erectile function (EFD score \u226524), (ii) time to normalization of EFD score (\u226524), (iii) percentage of patients capable of intercourse in response to phosphieserase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), and (iv) time to achieve response to PDE5i. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:Despite positive animal data, oral tacrolimus as used in this trial failed to improve erectile function after nerve sparing radical prostatectomy. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS:The study is limited by a high attrition rate. The strengths include a randomized, placebo controlled design, extensive patient monitoring, use of medication diaries and a validated instrument as the primary outcome measure. CONCLUSION:Despite supportive animal data, tacrolimus used in this fashion in the RP population failed to demonstrate any superiority over placebo. Mulhall JP, Klein EA, Slawin K, et\u00a0al.

We conducted a retrospective study of 26 adult patients with LN. Tacrolimus was initiated at a dose of 3\u00a0mg/day after induction therapy. We retrospectively collected data on renal response; modified lupus nephritis disease activity index (m-LNDAI), including hematuria, proteinuria, complement 3, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR); and prednisolone (PSL) dose.

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "Background:Tacrolimus, a drug for prevention of rejection after kidney transplantation, has a narrow therapeutic window and is metabolized by the cytochrome P540 3A (CYP3A) system. Tacrolimus exposure increases after steroid tapering in many patients. The pregnane X receptor (PXR)-a mediator for CYP3A-has a steroid receptor and might regulate CYP3A5 activity depending on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP3A5 or PXR. This may contribute to differences in tacrolimus exposure after steroid tapering. Methods:In a cohort of renal transplant recipients, the influence of CYP3A5 and PXR SNPs (A7635G, C8055T and C25385T) on the dose-normalized Tacrolimus trough concentration (DnC0) and their potential interaction with each other after steroid taper were analysed by linear regression. Eligible were all 83 outpatient renal transplant patients on tacrolimus and steroids in a pharmacokinetic steady state at least 6 weeks after transplantation and whose blood was available for genetic analysis. Results:Compared with the CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype, the CYP3A5*3/*3 SNP showed a significantly stronger increase in DnC0 after steroid taper (+0.29\u2009\u00b5g/L/mg; P\u2009=\u20090.002). Of the tested PXR SNPs, PXR G7635G individuals had a significantly stronger increase in DnC0 (compared with A7635A,\u2009+0.31\u2009\u00b5g/L/mg; P\u2009=\u20090.02), with a weaker increase in A7635G heterozygotes (+0.17\u2009\u00b5g/L/mg; P\u2009=\u20090.124). There was neither interaction nor association between CYP3A5 and PXR SNPs. Conclusions:The magnitude of the DnC0 increase due to steroid taper after renal transplantation is related to CYP3A5 SNPs. Independently, the PXR G7635G SNP is related to this increase, proving the role of PXR in tacrolimus metabolism."}

We conducted a 5-year trial to determine whether TAC-QD is noninferior to TAC-BID for transplant outcomes. Adults who underwent de novo living kidney transplantation were randomly assigned (62 TAC-QD; 63 TAC-BID). We did not exclude ABO-/HLA- incompatible transplantation. TAC was initiated 7\u00a0days preoperatively (0.10\u00a0mg/kg/d). Mycophenolate mofetil, methylprednisolone, and basiliximab were administered.

Five-year graft failure rates were 6.5% and 9.5% for TAC-QD and TAC-BID, respectively (noninferiority, P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The estimated glomerular filtration rates were similar between the groups (noninferiority, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Tacrolimus was empirically dose reduced due to the expected DDI with posaconazole based on current recommendations. Due to a persistently prolonged QTc interval and need for mold coverage, antifungal prophylaxis was ultimately changed to isavuconazole at standard recommended dosing. Tacrolimus was empirically dose reduced by 40% based on limited available literature at the time; however, tacrolimus trough concentrations subsequently declined, requiring an increase in tacrolimus dose to maintain therapeutic trough concentrations. Adequate isavuconazole absorption was documented through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data by measuring an isavuconazole trough concentration and directly observing isavuconazole's shortening effect on the QTc interval, respectively.

Participants in the genotype-guided arm achieved therapeutic concentrations earlier at a median (IQR) of 3.4 (2.5-6.6)\u00a0days compared to those in the standard dosing arm of 4.7 (3.5-8.6) days (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049), and had fewer out-of-range concentrations [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.60 (0.44, 0.83), P\u00a0=\u00a00.002] compared to standard dosing, with no difference in frequency of adverse events between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS:CYP3A5 genotype-guided dosing stratified by age resulted in earlier attainment of therapeutic tacrolimus concentrations and fewer out-of-range concentrations."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "AbstractBackgroundPost-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a devastating complication of solid-organ transplant. In liver transplant, studies comparing the risk factors for early vs. late onset PTLD have been limited to single centers. Using a national database, we sought to compare early and late onset PTLD in adult and pediatric liver transplant patients in terms of patient characteristics, immunosuppressive regimens, and mortality.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis of the UNOS database to compare early (<1 year) and late (1+ year) onset PTLD in pediatric (<18) and adult (18+) liver transplant patients. We compared patient demographics, co-morbid conditions, immunosuppressive regimens, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) risk status, reason for transplant, and mortality. We categorized EBV and CMV risk status into high, intermediate, and low based on donor and recipient serostatus. Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher\u2019s exact test. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method, log-rank test, and multivariable Cox regression were used to examine mortality.ResultsNinety-two pediatric patients and 807 adult patients met study criteria. Overall mortality was 35.87 and 53.78% for pediatric and adult patients, respectively. In adults, unadjusted survival was significantly different for early vs. late onset PTLD (P < 0.001; Figure 1); the latter was associated with a 64.33% decreased mortality risk (95% CI: 51.17\u201373.95%; P < 0.001). There was no difference in mortality in pediatric patients (P = 0.549). In neither population was EBV risk status associated with early vs. late onset PTLD. In adults, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and steroid maintenance therapy were associated with late onset PTLD (P < 0.001; 0.006; <0.001).Figure 1.ConclusionWe conclude the following: (1) Mortality is greater for early vs. late onset PTLD in adult patients; the converse has been shown previously. (2) Tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids are associated with late onset PTLD in adult patients. (3) EBV risk status did not differ between early and late onset PTLD in both the adult and pediatric populations. This contradicts established reports that EBV negative serostatus of the recipient at the time of transplant is a risk factor for early onset PTLD.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures."}

We examined whether there was improvement of the most problematic symptoms, such as itching, pain, and vulvar constipation. Methods Ten girls, aged from 4 to 9 years old who were affected by vulvar LS, were enrolled in an open clinical study to confirm the efficacy of tacrolimus 0.03% ointment to treat LS. Tacrolimus was applied twice a day for 6 weeks and then stopped during the follow-up period. The study duration included 6 weeks of treatment and 6 weeks of follow-up. A literature search of the PubMed (MEDLINE) database was conducted of reports published since 1 January, 2004. Results Our study and previous studies indicated the potential effectiveness of tacrolimus in LS. Treatment with topical tacrolimus was well tolerated with significant improvement of itching, pain, and constipation. Conclusion Tacrolimus may be a safe and effective alternative treatment, without the risk of corticosteroid-related vulvar atrophy, for paediatric vulvar LS. LS could become a further indication of topical tacrolimus therapy if these promising results are confirmed in the future."}

We collected data from liver transplant recipients who became pregnant on immunosuppression regimens, pregnancy management, graft morbidity, and outcomes of mothers and neonates. METHODS:We searched the liver transplant database in Birmingham, United Kingdom, for women who reported pregnancy after liver transplantation from August 1986 through May 2016. We collected information on morbidities and outcomes of 139 pregnancies in 83 women (median age at conception, 27 y; range, 15-46 y). Fisher exact tests were used to compare categoric variables and Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare continuous variables. The primary outcome was the live birth rate in the entire cohort. Additional outcomes analyzed included differences in immunotherapy regimens, and outcomes associated with exposure to cyclosporine and tacrolimus, time to transplantation (<12 vs >12 mo), and time period of pregnancy (1986-2000 vs 2001-2016). RESULTS:Of the pregnancies, 69% resulted in live births, 19% resulted in miscarriages or still births, and 9% were terminated. A higher proportion of patients who conceived more than 1 year after liver transplantation had live births than of women who conceived before this time (98% vs 80%; P\u00a0= .006). Tacrolimus exposure was associated with higher risks of premature delivery (P\u00a0= .045) and caesarian section (P\u00a0= .031) than cyclosporine exposure. Compared with the period from 1986 to 2000, women who conceived from 2001 to 2016 had a significantly shorter time between transplantation and conception (median, 3 vs 7 y; P\u00a0= .027), frequent use of tacrolimus vs cyclosporine (84% vs 26%; P\u00a0= .001), and a higher incidence of cesarean section (44% vs 32%; P\u00a0= .025). CONCLUSIONS:Almost 70% of women who conceive after liver transplantation have live births, although this rate is lower than that of women in the overall population. These cases require involvement of hepatologists and obstetricians."}

In this study, the authors analyzed variability in the preanalytical phase of the inpatient tacrolimus TDM process at their institution. METHODS:Patients receiving tacrolimus (twice-daily formulation) and tacrolimus laboratory analysis were included in the study. Times of tacrolimus administration and laboratory study collection were extracted, and time distribution plots for each step in the inpatient TDM process were generated. RESULTS:Trough levels were drawn appropriately in 25.9% of the cases. Timing between doses was consistent, with 91.9% of the following dose administrations occurring 12 \u00b1 2 hours after the previous dose. Only 38.1% of the drug administrations occurred within 1 hour of laboratory study collection. Tacrolimus-related patient safety events were reported at a rate of 1.9 events per month while incorrect timing of TDM sample collection occurred approximately 200 times per month. Root cause analysis identified a TDM process marked by a lack of communication and coordination of drug administration and TDM sample collection. Extrapolating findings nationwide, we estimate $22 million in laboratory costs wasted annually. CONCLUSIONS:Based on this large single-center study, the authors concluded that the inpatient TDM process is prone to timing errors, thus is financially wasteful, and at its worst harmful to patients due to clinical decisions being made on the basis of unreliable data. Further work is needed on systems solutions to better align the laboratory study collection and drug administration processes."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Despite advances in surgical procedures and the optimization of immunosuppressive therapies in pediatric liver transplantation, acute rejection (AR) and serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) to tacrolimus still contribute to morbidity and mortality. Identifying risk factors of safety and efficacy parameters may help in optimizing individual immunosuppressive therapies. This study aimed to identify peritransplant predictors of AR and factors related to the risk of ADR to tacrolimus in a large Latin American cohort of pediatric liver transplant patients. METHODS:We performed a retrospective cohort study in a pediatric liver transplant population (n = 72). Peritransplant variables were collected retrospectively including demographic, clinical, laboratory parameters, genomic (CYP3A5 donor and recipients polymorphism), and tacrolimus trough concentrations (C0) over a 2-year follow-up period. Variability in tacrolimus C0 was calculated using percent coefficient of variation and tortuosity. ADR- and AR-free survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and risk factors were identified by multivariate Cox regression models. RESULTS:Cox-proportional hazard models identified that high tortuosity in tacrolimus C0 was associated with an 80% increased risk of AR [hazard ratio (HR), 1.80; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-3.22; P < 0.05], whereas steroid in maintenance doses decreased this risk (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31-0.99; P < 0.05). Forty-six patients experienced at least one ADR including hypomagnesemia, nephrotoxicity, hypertension, malignancies, and tremor as a first event. Multivariate analysis showed that C0 values 10 days before the event (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.21-1.39; P < 0.0001) and CYP3A5 expresser recipients (HR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.03-4.06; P < 0.05) were independent predictors of ADR. CONCLUSIONS:Tacrolimus C0 values, its variability, and CYP3A5 polymorphisms were identified as risk factors of AR and tacrolimus ADR. This knowledge may help to control and reduce their incidence in pediatric liver transplant patients. Prospective studies are important to validate these results."}

{"keyword": "Tacrolimus", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Local drug delivery systems that adjust the release of immunosuppressive drug in response to the nature and intensity of inflammation represent a promising approach to reduce systemic immunosuppression and its side effects in allotransplantation. Here we aimed to demonstrate that release of tacrolimus from triglycerol monostearate hydrogel is inflammation-dependent in vivo. We further report that by loading the hydrogel with a near-infrared dye, it is possible to monitor drug release non-invasively in an in vivo model of vascularized composite allotransplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Inflammation was induced by local challenge with lipopolysaccharides in na\u00efve rats 7 days after injection of tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in the hind limb. Tacrolimus levels in blood and tissues were measured at selected time points. A near-infrared dye was encapsulated in the hydrogel together with tacrolimus in order to monitor hydrogel deposits and drug release in vitro and in vivo in a model of vascularized composite allotransplantation. RESULTS:Injection of lipopolysaccharides led to increased blood and skin tacrolimus levels (p = 0.0076, day 7 vs. day 12 in blood, and p = 0.0007 in treated limbs, 48 h after injection compared to controls). Moreover, lipopolysaccharides-injected animals had higher tacrolimus levels in treated limbs compared to contralateral limbs (p = 0.0003 for skin and p = 0.0053 for muscle). Imaging of hydrogel deposits and tacrolimus release was achieved by encapsulating near-infrared dye in the hydrogel for 160 days. The correlation of tacrolimus and near-infrared dye release from hydrogel was R2 = 0.6297 and R2 = 0.5619 in blood and grafts of transplanted animals respectively and R2 = 0.6066 in vitro. CONCLUSIONS:Here we demonstrate the inflammation-responsiveness of a tacrolimus-loaded hydrogel in vivo. Moreover, we show that encapsulating a near-infrared dye in the hydrogel provides a reliable correlation of tacrolimus and dye release from the hydrogel, and an accessible non-invasive method for monitoring drug release from hydrogel deposits."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Cryopreserved abdominal aortic grafts were transplanted between Brown-Norway and Lewis rats. Tacrolimus (0.2 mg/kg daily) was administered from day 1 to day 30 (TAC1) or from day 7 to day 30 (TAC7), respectively. No immunosuppressed isogeneic (ISO) and allogeneic (ALO) rats combination served as control. Aortal wall infiltration by immunocompetent cells (MHC II+ cells of recipient origin) was studied on day 30 after transplantation. Flow cytometry was used for the analysis of day 30 sera for the presence of donor specific anti-MHC class I and II antibodies. RESULTS:The aortal allografts in both immunosuppressed groups showed regular morphology of aortal wall with no depositions of immunoglobulin G on day 30. The adventitial infiltration of non-immunosuppressed aortal allografts by MHC class II positive cells of recipient origin was significantly higher (ALO 20.7\u00b16.7 cells, P<0.001) compared to both immunosuppressed groups (TAC1 5.9\u00b15.5 cells, TAC7 6.1\u00b15.1 cells). Day 30 sera from the allogeneic non-immunosuppressed animals decreased significantly the binding of fluorescence-labelled MHC class I (46.9\u00b119.4%) and class II (65.8\u00b111.9%) antibody to donors spleen cells compared with day 30 sera from both immunosuppressed groups (TAC1, anti-MHC class I 102.4\u00b14.2%, p < 0.001, anti-MHC class II 102.6\u00b16.0%), (TAC7, anti-MHC class I 79.9\u00b13.3%, p < 0.001, anti-MHC class II 80.9\u00b12.7%). CONCLUSION:Both immunosuppressed protocols with tacrolimus (administration from day 1 or from day 7 following transplantation) were able to suppress acute cell- and antibody-mediated rejection of cryopreserved abdominal aortic allografts processed in accordance with our new standardized clinical protocol."}

Dogs were assigned to receive atenolol (1 mg/kg, PO, q 24 h) or a placebo for 5 to 7 days. After a washout period of 7 days, dogs then received the other treatment. Heart rate at rest (HRr) and heart rate induced by administration of isoproterenol (HRi) as a constant rate infusion (0.2 \u03bcg/kg/min for 5 to 7 minutes) were obtained by use of ECG 0, 0.25, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after administration of the final dose of atenolol or the placebo.

{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "PURPOSE:To investigate the role of atenolol in the gene expression of caspase 1 (Casp1) and Bcl2L1 on vascular endothelium of rat intestine after ischemia and reperfusion (IR). METHODS:Eighteen adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=6): SG (Sham group): no clamping of the superior mesenteric artery; IRG: IR plus saline group: IRG+At: IR plus Atenolol group. Rats from IRG and IRG+At were subjected to 60 min of intestinal ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Atenolol (2mg/kg) or saline were injected in the femoral vein 5 min before ischemia, 5 min and 55 min after reperfusion. Thereafter, intestinal segments were appropriately removed and processed for Endothelial Cell Biology Rat RT2 Profiler PCR Array. RESULTS:the anti-apoptotic Bcl2L1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated (-1.10) in the IRG and significantly up-regulated in the IRG+At (+14.15). Meanwhile, despite Casp1 gene expression was upregulated in both groups, it was significantly higher in the IRG (+35.06) than the IRG+At (+6.68). CONCLUSIONS:Atenolol presents antiapoptotic effects on rat intestine subjected to IR partly by the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2L1 gene expression. Moreover, atenolol can mitigate the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory effects of Casp1 gene on rat intestine after IR."}

To obtain formulations that allow to improve the bioavailability of this drug is a challenge for the pharmaceutical technology. The objective of this work was to increase the rate and extent of intestinal absorption of atenolol as model of a low permeability drug, developing a double technology strategy. To increase atenolol permeability an ion pair with brilliant blue was designed and the sustained release achieved through encapsulation in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs). The in vitro release studies showed a pH-dependent release from NPs, (particle size 437.30\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.92) with a suitable release profile of drug (atenolol) and counter ion (brilliant blue) under intestinal conditions. Moreover, with the in vivo assays, a significant increase (2-fold) of atenolol bioavailability after administering the ion-pair NPs by oral route was observed. In conclusion, the combination of ion-pair plus polymeric NPs have proved to be a simple and very useful approach to achieve a controlled release and to increase the bioavailability of a low permeability charged drugs."}

In this study, bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) photocatalyst was synthesized and applied to remove ATL in the aqueous system under simulated natural light. Emphasis was laid on the reaction kinetics and the impact of natural organic matter (NOM) (0-20\u202fmg/L). Possible transformation pathways were systematically investigated based on identification of reaction products via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). As a consequence, BiOCl presents highly photocatalytic efficiency yielding up to nearly 100% ATL conversion after 60\u202fmin of interaction, together with fairly high photostability evidenced by considerably efficient removal of ATL after 10 catalytic cycles. Four kinds of possible products are detected using LC-MS in the process of reaction, indicating possible transformation ways of ATL photocatalysis. NOM has an inhibiting impact on the removal of ATL and influences the products distribution. This study provides an emerging nanocatalyst for ATL photodegradation and could eventually lead to development of novel methods to control pharmaceutical contamination in water."}

However, the comparative cardiovascular event risk between the vasodilatory \u03b21-selective antagonist/\u03b23 agonist nebivolol and non-vasodilatory \u03b21-blockers, atenolol and metoprolol, is unknown. METHODS:Incident nebivolol, atenolol, or metoprolol monotherapy users with hypertension were identified using US claims data (2007-2014). The first \u03b2-blocker claim on/after 1/1/2008 defined the index drug/date. Hypertensive patients without pre-index cardiovascular history were followed until index drug discontinuation (>\u200990\u00a0day supply gap), use of other \u03b2-blockers, or end of continuous plan enrollment. Patients were pair-wise propensity score-matched using logistic regression, adjusted for baseline demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, comorbid chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatic disease, renal disease, and diabetes, and use of other antihypertensive drugs during baseline. Time to first hospital claim for a cardiovascular event was assessed via Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted for the variables above. RESULTS:Inclusion criteria were met by 81,402 patients (n\u2009=\u200927,134 in each matched treatment cohort), with no between-cohort differences in baseline characteristics, comorbid conditions, or average follow-up duration. Atenolol and metoprolol cohorts had greater risk of hospitalization for a composite event (myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, stroke) than nebivolol users (adjusted hazard ratios [95% confidence interval] atenolol: 1.68 [1.29, 2.17]; metoprolol: 2.05 [1.59, 2.63]; P\u2009<\u20090.001, both). Risks of most individual cardiovascular events were also lower with nebivolol, including myocardial infarction and angina versus atenolol, and myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and angina versus metoprolol (P\u2009<\u20090.05, all). CONCLUSIONS:Nebivolol was associated with significantly lower risk of hospitalization due to composite cardiovascular events than atenolol or metoprolol in this large retrospective cohort study of monotherapy with three different \u03b21-selective blockers in hypertensive patients.

Studies evaluating these methods are limited. OBJECTIVES:To determine the effects of butorphanol, atenolol, and balloon valvuloplasty (BV) on velocity ratio, VTI ratio, iPVA, mean PG, and max PG. ANIMALS:Twenty-seven dogs with PS (max PG >50 mm Hg). METHODS:Prospective study. All dogs underwent an echocardiogram at baseline, 5-minutes after administration of butorphanol (0.2-0.25 mg/kg IV), and 2-to-4 weeks after atenolol (1-1.5 mg/kg q12h). Twenty-one of these were evaluated 24-hours after BV. RESULTS:There were no significant differences (P\u2009>\u2009.05) amongst any of the methods of assessment of PS severity after butorphanol. After atenolol, mean (SD) of mean (57.0 [21.0] mm Hg) and max PG (93.1 [33.8] mm Hg) were significantly decreased (P\u2009\u2264\u2009.047) compared with baseline (65.2 [26.2] mm Hg and 108 [44.4] mm Hg, respectively).

Research aim: The aims of the study were to quantify concentrations of atenolol in human plasma and milk, to evaluate atenolol pharmacokinetics in lactating women, and to investigate subsequent infant exposure to atenolol via mother's milk.In this prospective, longitudinal observational study, participants were lactating mothers ( N = 3), 1 to 4 months postpartum, who had been taking atenolol for therapeutic reasons, and one 4-month-old breastfed infant. Eight milk samples were collected over 24 hr at different time points, together with a single blood sample from each lactating mother and the infant, and quantified using a new sensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method developed for this study.Peak milk concentrations of atenolol were observed in the women at 4 hr (Tmax) after oral administration. The dose-normalized maximum concentrations (Cmax) of all patients were similar. The mean milk-to-plasma ratio of the patients who were taking 25 to 100 mg of atenolol was 8.57%. In the mother-infant pair study, the ratio (%) of infant plasma drug concentration to maternal plasma drug concentration observed (18.87%) was similar to the relative infant dose estimated (18.20%). The relative infant dose values (13.96%-18.20%) for all patients were within 10% to 25% of maternal dosage.Atenolol use during breastfeeding should be undertaken with some precaution. If clinically indicated, an alternate beta blocker may be preferred."}

{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "BACKGROUND:The study was to develop an extended release (ER) encapsulated and compacted pellets of Atenolol using hydrophobic (wax based and polymeric based) and high viscosity grade hydrophilic matrix formers to control the release of this highly water soluble drug by extrusion/spheronization (ES). Atenolol is used for cardiovascular diseases and available as an immediate release (IR) tablet dosage form. The lipids, Carnauba wax (CW), Glyceryl monostearate (GMS) and cellulose based i.e. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and Ethyl cellulose (EC) were used in preparing Atenolol ER pellets. Thermal sintering and compaction techniques were also applied to control the burst release of Atenolol. METHOD:For this purpose, thirty-six trial formulations (F1-F36) were designed by Response Surface Methodology (RSM), using Design-Expert 10 software, keeping (HPMC K4M, K15\u00a0M & K100\u00a0M), (EC 7FP, 10FP & 100FP), waxes (GMS, & CW), their combinations, sintering temperature and duration, as input variables. Dissolution studies were performed in pH, 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 dissolution media. Drug release kinetics using different models such as zero order, first order, Korsmeyer-Peppas, Hixon Crowell, Baker-Lonsdale and Higuchi kinetics were studied with the help of DDsolver, an excel based add-in program. RESULTS:The formulations F35 and F36 showed compliance with Korsmeyer-Peppas Super case II transport model (R2\u2009=\u20090.975-0.971) in dissolution medium pH\u00a04.5. No drug excipient interaction observed by FTIR. Stereomicroscopy showed that sintered combination pellets, (F35), were highly spherical (AR\u2009=\u20091.061, and sphericity\u2009=\u20090.943). The cross-sectional SEM magnification (at 7000X) of F34 and F35 showed dense cross-linking. The results revealed that the optimized formulations were F35 (sintered pellets) and F36 (compacted pellets) effectively controlling the drug release for 12\u00a0h. CONCLUSION:Extended-release encapsulated, and compacted pellets were successfully prepared after the combination of lipids CW (10%) and GMS (20%) with EC (10FP 20% & 100FP 20%). Sintering and compaction, in addition, stabilized the system and controlled the initial burst release of the drug. Extended release (ER) Atenolol is an effective alternative of IR tablets in controlling hypertension and treating other cardiovascular diseases."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "KEY POINTS:The prevailing dogma about neurogenic regulation of vascular tone consists of major vasodilatation caused by CGRP (and possibly substance P) released from sensory-motor nerves and vasoconstriction caused by noradrenaline, ATP and neuropeptode Y release from sympathetic nerves. Most studies on perivascular nerve-mediated vasodilatation are made in vitro. In the present study, we provide evidence indicating that in vivo electrical perivascular nerve stimulation in rat mesenteric small arteries causes a large \u03b21-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, which contrasts with a smaller vasodilatation caused by endogenous CGRP that is only visible after inhibition of Y1 NPY receptors. ABSTRACT:Mesenteric arteries are densely innervated and the nerves are important regulators of vascular tone and hence blood pressure and blood flow. Perivascular sensory-motor nerves have been shown to cause vasodilatation in vitro. However, less is known about their function in vivo. Male Wistar rats (10-12 weeks old; n\u00a0=\u00a072) were anaesthetized with ketamine (3\u00a0mg kg-1 ) and xylazine (0.75\u00a0mg kg-1 ) or pentobarbital (60\u00a0mg kg-1 ). After a laparotomy, a section of second-order mesenteric artery was visualized in an organ bath after minimal removal of perivascular adipose tissue. The effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and drugs on artery diameter and blood flow were recorded with intravital microscopy and laser speckle imaging. EFS caused vasodilatation in arteries constricted with 1\u00a0\u03bcm U46619 in the presence of 140\u00a0\u03bcm suramin and 1\u00a0\u03bcm prazosin. The vasodilatation was inhibited by 1\u00a0\u03bcm tetrodotoxin and 5\u00a0\u03bcm guanethidine, although not by the 1\u00a0\u03bcm of the CGRP receptor antagonist BIBN4096bs. In the presence of 0.3\u00a0\u03bcm Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226, BIBN4096bs partly inhibited the vasodilatation. Atenolol at a concentration 1\u00a0\u03bcm inhibited the vasodilatation, whereas 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm of the \u03b22 -adrenoceptor selective antagonist ICI-118,551 had no effect. Increasing the extracellular [K+ ] to 20\u00a0mm caused vasodilatation but was converted to vasoconstriction in the presence of 1\u00a0\u03bcm BIBN4096bs, and constriction to 30\u00a0mm potassium was potentiated by BIBN4096bs. Atenolol but not BIBN4096bs increased contraction to EFS in the absence of suramin and prazosin. In mesenteric small arteries of anaesthetized rats, EFS failed to stimulate major dilatation via sensory-motor nerves but induced sympathetic \u03b21 -adrenoceptor-mediated dilatation."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "Atenolol (ATL) has been widely detected in wastewater and aquatic environment. Although satisfactory removal of ATL from wastewater could be achieved, the mineralization ratio is usually low, which may result in the accumulation of its transformation products in the effluent and cause additional ecological risk to the environment. The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of heat activated persulfate (PS) in the removal of ATL from wastewater. Influencing factors including temperature, PS dosage, solution pH, existence of NO3-, Cl-, HCO3- and Suwannee river fulvic acid (SRFA) were examined. Complete removal of ATL was achieved within 40\u202fmin\u202fat pH 7.0 and 70\u202f\u00b0C by using 0.5\u202fmM\u202fPS. Inhibitive effects of HCO3- and FA had been observed on ATL oxidation, which was increased with the increase of their concentration. Sulfate radical (SO4-) was determined as the main reactive species by quenching experiment. Eight intermediates produced in ATL degradation were identified, and four degradation pathways were proposed based on the analysis of mass spectrum and frontier electron densities. The distribution of major intermediates was influenced by reaction temperature. Hydroxylation intermediates and deamidation intermediate were the most prominent at 50\u202f\u00b0C and 60\u202f\u00b0C, respectively. All intermediates were completely degraded in 40\u202fmin except P134 at 70\u202f\u00b0C. Effective removal of TOC (74.12%) was achieved with 0.5\u202fmM\u202fPS, pH 7.0 and 70\u202f\u00b0C after 240\u202fmin. The results proved that heat activation of PS is a promising method to remove organic pollutants in wastewater."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "The OECD 309 guideline uses spiked incubation tests to provide data on biodegradation kinetics in surface waters. However, potential limitations of spiking test chemicals into the studied water have not been investigated. We conducted the OECD 309 test with unspiked surface water relying on chemical residues present in the water. Parallel experiments were conducted with the same water spiked with 13 chemicals at higher concentrations (50 \u03bcg L-1). Six chemicals detected in both the spiked and the unspiked systems were biodegraded. For each chemical the concentration change over time differed between the systems. Tramadol and venlafaxine showed constant concentrations in the spiked systems but increasing concentrations in the unspiked systems. Atenolol and metoprolol showed first-order elimination with no lag in the unspiked systems, compared to a lag of 15-28 d followed by zero-order elimination kinetics in the spiked systems. Acesulfame was only slightly degraded (<50%) in the unspiked system, while removal was complete (>99%) in the spiked systems. Gabapentin displayed a complex behavior where the features differed markedly between the spiked and the unspiked systems. We conclude that spiking can strongly influence biodegradation, reducing the environmental relevance of test results. Under some conditions biodegradation can be measured in unspiked natural waters instead."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:Altered autonomic activity has been implicated in the development of cardiac dysfunction during seizures. This study investigates whether intervening in seizure progression with diazepam will reduce seizure-induced cardiomyopathy. Second, this study examines the hypothesis that combining atenolol with diazepam, as an intervention after seizure onset, will combat cardiac injury during status epilepticus. METHODS:Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with electroencephalographic/electrocardiographic electrodes to allow simultaneous recordings during seizures induced by intrahippocampal (2\u00a0nmol, 1\u00a0\u03bcL) kainic acid (KA). Subcutaneous saline, atenolol (5\u00a0mg\u00b7kg-1 ), diazepam (5\u00a0mg\u00b7kg-1 ), or atenolol and diazepam (n\u00a0=\u00a012/group) were administered at 60\u00a0minutes post-KA and daily for 7\u00a0days, at which point echocardiography, susceptibility to aconitine-induced arrhythmias, and histology were evaluated. RESULTS:Seizure activity was associated with immediately increased heart rate, QTc interval, and blood pressure (BP; 10%-30% across indices). Seven days postseizure, saline-treated animals were found to have reduced left ventricular function, increased fibrotic scarring, and an elevated risk of aconitine-induced arrhythmias. Diazepam treatment significantly reduced cumulative seizure behaviors by 79% compared to saline-treated animals but offered no cardiac protection. Diazepam significantly raised BP (35%) and increased the risk of bigeminal arrhythmias (36%) compared to saline-treated animals. Atenolol administration, either alone or with diazepam, reduced heart rate, QTc interval, and BP back to control levels. Atenolol also preserved cardiac morphology and reduced arrhythmia risk. SIGNIFICANCE:Attenuation of seizure with diazepam offered no cardiac protection; however, coadministration of atenolol with diazepam prevented the development of seizure-induced cardiac dysfunction. This study demonstrates that atenolol intervention should be strongly considered as an adjunct clinical treatment to reduce cardiomyopathy during seizures."}

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of Amaranthus tricolor on isoproterenol-induced oxidative stress, fibrosis, and myocardial damage in ovariectomized rats. Ovariectomy surgery was conducted to remove both ovaries from the rats. After recovery, rats were administered with ISO subcutaneously (50\u202fmg/kg) twice a week and were treated with ethanolic extracts of A. tricolor. This investigation showed that the level of oxidative stress markers was significantly increased while the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. A. tricolor extract and atenolol treatment prevented the rise of malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and advanced protein oxidation product. Moreover, elevated activities of AST, ALT, and CK-MB enzymes were also lowered by both atenolol and A. tricolor treatment. Increased uric acid and creatinine levels were also normalized by atenolol, and A. Tricolor treatment in ISO administered ovariectomized rats. ISO-induced ovariectomized rats also showed massive inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis and iron deposition in heart compared to sham rats. Atenolol and A. tricolor treatment prevented the inflammatory cells infiltration, fibrosis, and iron deposition. These results suggest that A. tricolor treatment may protect against ISO administered myocardial infarction in ovariectomized rats probably by preventing inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Further research is warranted to examine molecular mechanism of cardioprotective effect of A. tricolor."}

However, the side effects such as bronchial hyperreactivity may be intolerable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency, risk factors and management of intolerable side effects (ISEs) during propranolol therapy. In total, 1260 children were studied. The incidence of ISEs was 2.1% (26 patients). Severe sleep disturbance was the most common reason for propranolol cessation, accounting for 65.4% of cases. In total, 23 and 3 patients received atenolol and prednisolone as second-line therapy, respectively. Treatment response was observed in 92.3% (24/26) of cases (showing excellent or good response to therapy). No toxicity-related permanent treatment discontinuation occurred during atenolol or prednisolone therapy. In the univariate analysis, younger age, premature birth, and lower body weight were associated with ISEs (P\u2009<\u20090.05). In the multivariate analysis, only age (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.201-2.793, P\u2009=\u20090.009) and body weight (95% CI: 1.036-1.972, P\u2009=\u20090.014) were associated with ISEs. Our study suggests that ISEs are rare in patients with IHs who are treated with propranolol. Predictive factors for ISEs include younger age and lower body weight. Atenolol and prednisolone are effective and safe alternatives to propranolol in the treatment of refractory IHs."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "Animal models are frequently used for in vitro physiologic and drug transport studies of the colon, but there exists significant pressure to improve assay throughput as well as to achieve tighter control of experimental variables than can be achieved with animals. Thus, development of a primary in vitro colonic epithelium cultured as high resistance with transport protein expression and functional behavior similar to that of a native colonic would be of enormous value for pharmaceutical research. A collagen scaffold, in which the degree of collagen cross-linking was present as a gradient, was developed to support the proliferation of primary colonic cells. The gradient of cross-linking created a gradient in stiffness across the scaffold, enabling the scaffold to resist deformation by cells. mRNA expression and quantitative proteomic mass spectrometry of cells growing on these surfaces as a monolayer suggested that the transporters present were similar to those in vivo. Confluent monolayers acted as a barrier to small molecules so that drug transport studies were readily performed. Transport function was evaluated using atenolol (a substrate for passive paracellular transport), propranolol (a substrate for passive transcellular transport), rhodamine 123 (Rh123, a substrate for P-glycoprotein), and riboflavin (a substrate for solute carrier transporters). Atenolol was poorly transported with an apparent permeability ( Papp) of <5 \u00d7 10-7 cm s-1, while propranolol demonstrated a Papp of 9.69 \u00d7 10-6 cm s-1. Rh123 was transported in a luminal direction ( Papp,efflux/ Papp,influx = 7) and was blocked by verapamil, a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Riboflavin was transported in a basal direction, and saturation of the transporter was observed at high riboflavin concentrations as occurs in vivo. It is anticipated that this platform of primary colonic epithelium will find utility in drug development and physiological studies, since the tissue possesses high integrity and active transporters and metabolism similar to that in vivo."}

Of the available information, most was obtained before implementation of modern hemodialysis membranes. Our study characterized dialyzability of the most commonly prescribed \u03b2-blockers in patients undergoing high-flux hemodialysis.Patients on hemodialysis (n=8) were recruited to an open label, pharmacokinetic, four-way crossover trial. Single doses of atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol were administered on separate days in random order to each patient. Plasma and dialysate drug concentrations were measured, and dialyzability was determined by the recovery clearance and arterial venous difference methods.Using the recovery clearance method, the dialytic clearance values for atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol were 72, 87, 44, and 0.2 ml/min, respectively (P<0.001). Applying the arterial venous difference method, the dialytic clearance values of atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, and carvedilol were 167, 114, 96, and 24 ml/min, respectively (P<0.001).Atenolol and metoprolol are extensively cleared by hemodialysis compared with the negligible dialytic clearance of carvedilol. Contrary to estimates of dialyzability on the basis of previous literature, our data indicate that bisoprolol is also dialyzable. This finding highlights the importance of conducting dialyzability studies to definitively characterize drug dialytic clearance."}
{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "Atenolol, a hydrophilic beta blocker, has been used as a model drug for studying passive permeability of biological membranes such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intestinal epithelium. However, the extent of S-atenolol (the active enantiomer) distribution in brain has never been evaluated, at equilibrium, to confirm that no transporters are involved in its transport at the BBB.To assess whether S-atenolol, in fact, depicts the characteristics of a low passive permeable drug at the BBB, a microdialysis study was performed in rats to monitor the unbound concentrations of S-atenolol in brain extracellular fluid (ECF) and plasma during and after intravenous infusion. A pharmacokinetic model was developed, based on the microdialysis data, to estimate the permeability clearance of S-atenolol into and out of brain. In addition, the nonspecific binding of S-atenolol in brain homogenate was evaluated using equilibrium dialysis.The steady-state ratio of unbound S-atenolol concentrations in brain ECF to that in plasma (i.e., Kp,uu,brain) was 3.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4%, a value much less than unity. The unbound volume of distribution in brain (Vu, brain) of S-atenolol was also calculated as 0.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0mL/g brain, indicating that S-atenolol is evenly distributed within brain parenchyma. Lastly, equilibrium dialysis showed limited nonspecific binding of S-atenolol in brain homogenate with an unbound fraction (fu,brain) of 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07.It is concluded, based on Kp,uu,brain being much smaller than unity, that S-atenolol is actively effluxed at the BBB, indicating the need to re-consider S-atenolol as a model drug for passive permeability studies of BBB transport or intestinal absorption."}

{"keyword": "Atenolol", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:There is no consensus on administering hyperosmolar formulations by mouth to neonates. In 1976, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics published a recommendation of not administer formulations with an osmolarity higher than 400\u202fmOsm/L due to the possible damage to intestine and relationship with necrotizing enterocolitis. Since this recommendation, exists a general trend of reducing osmolality of oral formulations without considering the pharmacokinetics of absorption of the drugs. The objective of this study was to characterize the permeability values of drugs formulated at different osmolalities by using a well-established rat intestinal perfusion model and to measure the osmolality of the most used formulations in our neonatology unit. METHODS:For the osmolality measurement study, most common used oral drugs were selected (compounded formulations and drug products). Osmolality of three dilutions (1:1, 1:4 and 1:8) were measured using a cryoscopic descent osmometer. Atenolol, caffeine, furosemide, hydrocortisone and paracetamol were selected for the permeability study. Three suspensions were elaborated of each drug (150\u202fmOsm/kg, 300\u202fmOsm/kg and 1500\u202fmOsm/kg). Permeability values and absorption rate coefficients were determined in complete small intestine using in situ \"closed loop\" perfusion method. RESULTS:The formulations that resulted to be hyperosmolar (>400\u202fmOsm/kg) were 86% (70% of these proved to be above 1500\u202fmOsm/kg). The permeability study shown that the osmolality is inversely proportional to the apparent permeability of the drug in the studied drugs. The permeability values obtained with hyperosmolar samples were lower compared to 150\u202fmOsm/kg or 300\u202fmOsm/kg.

The NV and OH facilities operated at solids retention times (SRTs) of 8 and 23\u202fdays, respectively. Using microwave-assisted extraction, the biotransformation rates of the chosen TOrCs were measured in the total mixed liquor. Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and atenolol biotransformed in all three redox regimes irrespective of the activated sludge source. The biotransformation of N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), triclosan, and benzotriazole was observed in aerobic activated sludge from both treatment plants; however, anoxic biotransformation of these three compounds was seen only in anoxic activated sludge from NV. Carbamazepine was recalcitrant in all three redox regimes and both sources of activated sludge. Atenolol and DEET had greater biotransformation rates in activated sludge with a higher SRT (23\u202fdays), while trimethoprim had a higher biotransformation rate in activated sludge with a lower SRT (8\u202fdays). The remaining compounds did not show any dependence on SRT. Lyophilized, heat inactivated sludge solids were used to determine the sorption-distribution coefficients. Triclosan was the most sorptive compound followed by carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, DEET, and benzotriazole. The sorption-distribution coefficients were similar across redox conditions and sludge sources. The biotransformation rates and sorption-distribution coefficients determined in this study can be used to improve fate prediction of the target TOrCs in BNR treatment systems."}

In hearts with small IZs and low baseline incidence of ischaemia-induced VF, CATs, delivered to the uninvolved zone (UZ), increased ischaemia-induced VF incidence. This effect was not mimicked by atrial pacing, hence, not due to sinus tachycardia. However, the CATs-facilitated increase in ischaemia-induced VF was inhibited by atenolol and butoxamine (but not trimazosin), indicative of \u03b21 - and \u03b22 - but not \u03b11 -adrenoceptor involvement (confirmed by immunoblot analysis of downstream phosphoproteins). CATs did not facilitate VF in low-flow globally ischaemic hearts, which have no UZ.Catecholamines facilitated ischaemia-induced VF when risk was low, acting via \u03b21 - and \u03b22 - adrenoceptors located in the UZ. There was no scope for facilitation when VF risk was high (large IZ), which may explain why \u03b2-blockers have equivocal effectiveness in humans."}

The inhibitory effects of subtype-selective \u03b2-AR antagonists on isoprenaline-induced relaxation were then investigated. Results The relaxant potencies of the catecholamines were ranked as: isoprenaline > noradrenaline \u2248 adrenaline, whereas the rank order was isoprenaline > noradrenaline > adrenaline in the presence of propranolol (a non-selective \u03b2-AR antagonist; 3 \u00d7 10-7 M). Atenolol (a selective \u03b21-AR antagonist; 3 \u00d7 10-7-10-6\u2005M) acted as a competitive antagonist of isoprenaline-induced relaxation, and the pA2 value was calculated to be 6.49 (95% confidence interval: 6.34-6.83). The relaxation to isoprenaline was not affected by ICI-118,551 (a selective \u03b22-AR antagonist) at 10-9-10-8\u2005M, but was competitively antagonized by 10-7-3 \u00d7 10-7\u2005M, with a pA2 value of 7.41 (95% confidence interval: 7.18-8.02). In the presence of propranolol (3 \u00d7 10-7 M), the relaxant effect of isoprenaline was competitively antagonized by bupranolol (a non-selective \u03b2-AR antagonist), with a pA2 value of 5.90 (95% confidence interval: 5.73-6.35).

Herein, a new kind of composite NF membrane with enhanced antibacterial properties was successfully fabricated through LbL self-assembly method, having polyether sulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane as support layer, N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl] chloride chitosan (HTCC) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) as active layer, and epichlorohydrin (ECH) as crosslinking reagent. Subsequently, nanosilver was finally loaded on the membrane surface by photoreduction technique. Our results revealed that the positively charged four semi-assembled membranes prepared using 5 g/L HTCC aqueous solution, 1 g/L PAA solution (pH = 6-8), and 0.5 g/L NaCl as supporting salt exhibited optimum performance. Atomic force microscopy and contact angle tests showed that the prepared membranes improved the surface roughness and hydrophilicity as compared to those of the polyether sulfone (PES) membranes.

The CAR included Captopril, Timolol, Propranolol, Atenolol, and Amiodarone. Cardiovascular drugs can effectively quench the endogenous fluorescence of HSA by static quenching mechanism. The fluorescence quenching of HSA is mainly caused by complex formation of HSA with CAR. The binding reaction of CAR with HSA can be concluded that hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions are the main binding forces in the CAR-HSA system. The results showed that CAR strongly quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA through a static quenching procedure, and nonradiation energy transfer happened within molecules. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy absorption studies showed that the secondary structure was changed according to the interaction of HSA and CAR.

{"keyword": "Hackberry", "texts": "Hackberry (Celtis australis L.) is widely used for reforestation and as shade tree in parks and roadside plantings in southern Europe (4). In autumn 2011, a foliar disease was observed affecting several trees planted in a garden area located in Alzira (Valencia province, eastern Spain). Symptoms appeared on lower leaf surfaces as reddish to dark brown velvety irregular spots, later becoming grayish brown on the upper surface. Most of the infected trees were prematurely defoliated. Spots on lower leaf surfaces were covered by mycelium, conidiophores, and conidia. Fungal isolates were recovered directly from the structures present on the lesions and by surface-disinfecting small fragments of symptomatic leaf tissue in 0.5% NaOCl, double-rinsing the sections in sterile water, and plating the sections onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 0.5 g of streptomycin sulfate per liter. Single conidium cultures made onto PDA were maintained for 2 months at 25\u00b0C in darkness for morphological examination. Conidia were thick walled, dark reddish brown, often markedly curved or coiled, cylindrical to obclavate, smooth, wrinkled, or verrucose, typically multicellular, 2 to 40 transversely septate and occasionally with 1 to 3 longitudinal or oblique septa that were often constricted, 20 to 96 (44.9) \u00d7 6 to 9 (7.1) \u03bcm, with an inconspicuous scar at the base. Morphological characters corresponded to the description of Sirosporium celtidis (Biv. ex Spreng) M. B. Ellis published in 1963 (3). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1 and ITS4 from DNA extracted from the isolate AL1, and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. JX397963). The sequence was identical to that obtained from an isolate of S. celtidis from the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, The Netherlands (CBS 289.50). Pathogenicity tests were conducted on five 2-year-old hackberry trees by spraying onto the upper and lower leaf surfaces a conidial suspension of S. celtidis (approximately 50 ml/plant, 106 conidia/ml of water). Five control plants were sprayed with sterile water. Plants were covered with clear plastic bags and incubated in a growth chamber for 72 h at 25\u00b0C with a 12-h photoperiod. First leaf spots were visible on inoculated plants after 7 days, but symptoms were not observed on control plants. The fungus was reisolated from leaf lesions on inoculated plants, confirming Koch's postulates. S. celtidis was first described in Sicily in 1815 (3) and has been recorded on various hackberry species in Mediterranean countries and the USA (1,2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the disease in Spain. The economic and ecological significance of the pathogen in natural ecosystems in Spain remains to be determined but it could certainly become a serious problem for nurseries and urban plantings.

{"keyword": "Hackberry", "texts": "1 The first trees establishing in grasslands may indirectly favour their seedlings in competition with neighbouring herbaceous vegetation by increasing soil fertility with nitrogen\u2010rich litter and by reducing light levels under their canopies. It is predicted that increasing soil nitrogen availability will accelerate invasion of trees by stimulating their growth more than that of herbaceous species. Decreasing light availability is predicted to increase tree invasion by limiting the growth of herbaceous vegetation more than that of trees (competitive release). 2 We tested these predictions using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an aggressive alien invader of grasslands in the southern USA, and Hackberry (Celtis laevigata), which is a native tree common in these grasslands. 3 Nitrogen and light were manipulated in two factorial field experiments in grasslands in Texas, USA. In the first, nitrogen was increased and light was decreased in plots with planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings. In the second experiment, light availability to planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings was increased by holding back prairie vegetation. 4 In the first experiment, growth of Celtis and Sapium seedlings increased with nitrogen fertilization while the above\u2010ground biomass of prairie vegetation did not change. Prairie vegetation biomass decreased and tree seedling growth increased under shading. Sapium's growth increased dramatically in the treatment with combined nitrogen and shade. Sapium survival decreased when shade was applied. 5 In the second experiment, Sapium growth increased with increased light. Thus, increased Sapium growth at low light levels in the shade experiment was probably a consequence of decreased competitive interference from prairie vegetation, rather than better absolute performance of Sapium in low light levels. 6 These results provide evidence for facilitation as a mechanism involved in tree invasions of grasslands. Changes in resource levels, perhaps in combination with other factors, may explain rapid conversion of grassland communities to woodlands after the first pioneer trees are established. The marked response of Sapium to the combination of nitrogen and shade suggests that these positive feedbacks may be particularly strong for this alien plant species."}

In vivo experiments, myricetin attenuated the severity of inflammatory lesion and neutrophil infiltration. Moreover, myricetin pretreatment induced a significant decrease in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2 triggered by LPS.

The adsorption process of CS-BT for Nd3+ was well fitted with a Freundlich model and the kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order rate equation. The maximum adsorption capacity for Nd3+ was 133.72 mg/g and dynamic adsorption characteristics of single ion (La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+) were investigated.

{"keyword": "Bayberry", "texts": "Bayberry (Myrica pensylvanica) fruits are covered with a remarkably thick layer of crystalline wax consisting of triacylglycerol (TAG) and diacylglycerol (DAG) esterified exclusively with saturated fatty acids. As the only plant known to accumulate soluble glycerolipids as a major component of surface waxes, Bayberry represents a novel system to investigate neutral lipid biosynthesis and lipid secretion by vegetative plant cells. The assembly of Bayberry wax is distinct from conventional TAG and other surface waxes, and instead proceeds through a pathway related to cutin synthesis (Simpson and Ohlrogge, 2016). In this study, microscopic examination revealed that the fruit tissue that produces and secretes wax (Bayberry knobs) is fully developed before wax accumulates and that wax is secreted to the surface without cell disruption. Comparison of transcript expression to genetically related tissues (Bayberry leaves, M. rubra fruits), cutin-rich tomato and cherry fruit epidermis, and to oil-rich mesocarp and seeds, revealed exceptionally high expression of 13 transcripts for acyl-lipid metabolism together with down-regulation of fatty acid oxidases and desaturases. The predicted protein sequences of the most highly expressed lipid-related enzyme-encoding transcripts in Bayberry knobs are 100% identical to the sequences from Bayberry leaves, which do not produce surface DAG or TAG. Together, these results indicate that TAG biosynthesis and secretion in Bayberry is achieved by both up and down-regulation of a small subset of genes related to the biosynthesis of cutin and saturated fatty acids, and also implies that modifications in gene expression, rather than evolution of new gene functions, was the major mechanism by which Bayberry evolved its specialized lipid metabolism.

The composition is also striking, consisting of completely saturated triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, and monoacylglycerol with palmitate and myristate acyl chains. To gain insight into the unique properties of Bayberry wax synthesis, we examined the chemical and morphological development of the wax layer, monitored wax biosynthesis through [(14)C]-radiolabeling, and sequenced the transcriptome. Radiolabeling identified sn-2 monoacylglycerol as an initial glycerolipid intermediate. The kinetics of [(14)C]-DAG and [(14)C]-TAG accumulation and the regiospecificity of their [(14)C]-acyl chains indicated distinct pools of acyl donors and that final TAG assembly occurs outside of cells. The most highly expressed lipid-related genes were associated with production of cutin, whereas transcripts for conventional TAG synthesis were >50-fold less abundant. The biochemical and expression data together indicate that Bayberry surface glycerolipids are synthesized by a pathway for TAG synthesis that is related to cutin biosynthesis. The combination of a unique surface wax and massive accumulation may aid understanding of how plants produce and secrete non-membrane glycerolipids and also how to engineer alternative pathways for lipid production in non-seeds."}

{"keyword": "Bayberry", "texts": "Bayberry (Myrica rubra) is a fruit tree native to the subtropical regions of China. It produces fruit with a unique taste and pharmacological characteristics, thus making it a widely cultivated tree commercially in many regions of China, including Zhejiang, Fujian, Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces. Recently, a twig blight disease occurred on the fruit tree and caused destructive damage of plantings in the Zhejiang Province. However, the etiology of the disease was unclear. This study was carried out to identify the causal agent(s) of the blight disease on bayberry. Fungal isolates were obtained from blighted twig samples collected from bayberry fields in Xianju, Rui\u2019an, and Huangyan of Zhejiang Province. The majority (87.9\ufffd %) of the 257 fungal isolates were identified as Pestalotiopsis spp. based on their conidial morphology. DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA gene and the \u03b2-tubulin gene were obtained from six representative strains (XJ27, XJ42, RA2-1, YS26, YS44 and RA1-2) of the Pestalotiopsis spp. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three of the strains (XJ27, XJ42, and RA2-1) grouped with P. versicolor (Speg.) Steyaert while the other three strains (YS26, YS44 and RA1-2) grouped with P. microspora (Speg.) Batista & Peres. Pathogenicity tests in the greenhouse showed that all these six isolates of Pestalotiopsis spp. caused twig blight disease symptoms on bayberry plants, which were the same as observed in naturally infected plants in the field. Our results clearly indicated that P. versicolor and P. microspora were the major pathogens causing the twig blight disease on bayberry in southern China."}
{"keyword": "Bayberry", "texts": "Chinese bayberry (Myrica rubra Sieb. et Zucc.) is a subtropical fruit tree native to China and other Asian countries, and culture of this Myricaceae plant has been recorded in Chinese history for more than 2000 years. Bayberry fruit is delicious with attractive color, flavor, and high economic value. Compared with other berries, bayberry fruit is a rich source of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G, e.g., 64.8 mg/100 g fresh weight in 'Biqi' cultivar), which accounts for at least 85 % of the anthocyanins in the fruit. Bayberry is also a plant with high medicinal value since different organs have been used historically as folk medicines. Research efforts suggest bayberry extracts contain antioxidants that exhibit bioactivities counteracting inflammation, allergens, diabetes, cancer, bacterial infection, diarrhea and other health issues. Bayberry compounds have been isolated and characterized to provide a better understanding of the chemical mechanisms underlying the biological activities of bayberry extracts and to elaborate the structure-activity relationships. As the identification of compounds progresses, studies investigating the in vivo metabolism and bioavailability as well as potential toxicity of bayberry extracts in animal models are receiving more attention. In addition, breeding and genetic studies of bayberry with high accumulation of health-benefiting compounds may provide new insight for the bayberry research and industry. This review is focused on the main medicinal properties reported and the possible pharmaceutically active compounds identified in different bayberry extracts."}

Bayberry extract from \"Biqi\" was used for both in vitro and in vivo testing because of its high C3G content and high antioxidant capacity. Pretreatment of \u03b2 cells with CRBFE (containing 0.5\u2009\u03bcmol/L C3G) prevented cell death, increased cellular viability, and decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and cell necrosis induced by 800 or 1,200\u2009\u03bcmol/L H\u2082O\u2082. CRBFE dose-dependently up-regulated pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 gene expression, contributing to increased insulin-like growth factor II gene transcript levels and insulin protein in INS-1 cells. In addition, administration of CRBFE (150\u2009\u03bcg of C3G/10\u2009g of body weight twice per day) significantly reduced blood glucose in streptozotocin-induced diabetic ICR mice and increased the glucose tolerance in an oral glucose tolerance test (P<.05).

Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to construct calibration models with different pre-processing methods. The number of PLS factors was optimised. The results show PLS models are good for predicting glucose, fructose and sucrose concentrations in bayberry juice, and their prediction accuracy can be improved by using derivative process with the exception of the glucose. The best models were mostly given by the second derivative processed spectra, especially for sucrose with the determination coefficient, R \u00b2 of 0.9931.

Moreover, sub-acute chronic inflammation is a contributor to the pathology of diverse degenerative diseases (Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and arthritis). Given the known limitations in Western medicine to treat a broad range of inflammatory related illness as well as the emergence of antibiotic resistance, there is a renewed interest in complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to achieve these means.A high throughput (HTP) screening of >1400 commonly sold natural products (bulk herbs, cooking spices, teas, leaves, supplement components, nutraceutical food components, fruit and vegetables, rinds, seeds, polyphenolics etc.) was conducted to elucidate anti-inflammatory substances in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli serotype O111:B4) monocytes: RAW 264.7 macrophages [peripheral], BV-2 microglia [brain]) relative to hydrocortisone, dexamethasone and L-N6-(1Iminoethyl)lysine (L-NIL). HTP evaluation was also carried out for lethal kill curves against E.coli 0157:H7 1x106 CFU/mL relative to penicillin. Validation studies were performed to assess cytokine profiling using antibody arrays. Findings were corroborated by independent ELISAs and NO2-/iNOS expression quantified using the Griess Reagent and immunocytochemistry, respectively. For robust screening, we developed an in-vitro efficacy paradigm to ensure anti-inflammatory parameters were observed independent of cytotoxicity. This caution was taken given that many plants exert tumoricidal and anti-inflammatory effects at close range through similar signaling pathways, which could lead to false positives.The data show that activated BV-2 microglia cells (+ LPS 1\u03bcg/ml) release >10-fold greater IL-6, MIP1/2, RANTES and nitric oxide (NO2-), where RAW 264.7 macrophages (+ LPS 1\u03bcg/ml) produced > 10-fold rise in sTNFR2, MCP-1, IL-6, GCSF, RANTES and NO2-. Data validation studies establish hydrocortisone and dexamethasone as suppressing multiple pro-inflammatory processes, where L-NIL suppressed NO2-, but had no effect on iNOS expression or IL-6. The screening results demonstrate relative few valid hits with anti-inflammatory effects at < 250\u03bcg/ml for the following: Bay Leaf (Laurus nobilis), Elecampagne Root (Inula helenium), Tansy (Tanacetum vulgare),Yerba (Eriodictyon californicum) and Centipeda (Centipeda minima), Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Turmeric Root (Curcuma Longa), Osha Root (Ligusticum porteri), Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) and constituents: cardamonin, apigenin, quercetin, biochanin A, eupatorin, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and butein.

Bayberry tannin-immobilized mesoporous silica bead (BT-SiO2) was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction to verify the crystallinity, field-emission scanning electron microscopy to observe the surface morphology, and surface area and porosity analyzer to measure the mesoporous porous structure. Subsequently, the adsorption experiments to Cr(III) were applied to evaluate the adsorption performances of BT-SiO2. It was found that the adsorption of Cr(III) onto BT-SiO2 was pH-dependent, and the maximum adsorption capacity was obtained in the pH range of 5.0-5.5. The adsorption capacity was 1.30 mmol g(-1) at 303 K and pH 5.5 when the initial concentration of Cr(III) was 2.0 mmol L(-1). Based on proton nuclear magnetic resonance (HNMR) analyses, the adsorption mechanism of Cr(III) on BT-SiO2 was proved to be a chelating interaction. The adsorption kinetic data can be well described using pseudo-first-order model and the equilibrium data can be well fitted by the Langmuir isothermal model. Importantly, no bayberry tannin was leached out during the adsorption process and BT-SiO2 can simultaneously remove coexisting metal ions from aqueous solutions. In conclusion, this study provides a new strategy for the preparation of tannin-immobilized adsorbents that are highly effective in removal of heavy metals from aqueous solutions."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Topiramate is a newer broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED). Some studies have shown the benefits of topiramate in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). However, there are no current systematic reviews to determine the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the treatment of JME. SEARCH METHODS:For the latest update, on 10 July 2018 we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid 1946- ), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA:We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating topiramate versus placebo or other AED treatment for people with JME, with the outcomes of proportion of responders and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta-analyses due to the limited available data. MAIN RESULTS:We included three studies with a total of 83 participants. For efficacy, a greater proportion of participants in the topiramate group had a 50% or more reduction in primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) compared with participants in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between topiramate and valproate in participants responding with a 50% or more reduction in myoclonic seizures or in PGTCS, or becoming seizure-free. Concerning tolerability, we ranked AEs associated with topiramate as moderate to severe, while we ranked 59% of AEs linked to valproate as severe complaints. Moreover, systemic toxicity scores were higher in the valproate group than the topiramate group.Overall we judged all three studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and at unclear risk of reporting bias. We judged all three studies to be at low to unclear bias for the remaining risk of bias domains (random sequence, allocation, blinding). We judged the quality of the evidence from the studies to be very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We have found no new studies since the last version of this review was published in 2017. This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME. Based on the current limited available data, topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate, but has no clear benefits over valproate in terms of efficacy. Well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to test the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:Topiramate has been studied in the treatment of substance use disorders and is often used off-label in the treatment of other disorders with impaired impulse control. We sought to determine whether impulsiveness could predict topiramate treatment response in individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD). METHODS:In a post-hoc analysis of a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate for CUD, we examined the relationship between response to treatment and participants' baseline score on the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). During the original trial, topiramate was titrated up to 300\u2009mg/day over 6 weeks and maintained for 6 weeks. All participants received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. RESULTS:Individuals with total BIS-11 scores above the median had 11.2% more cocaine-free days with topiramate versus placebo (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.047). Individuals with first-order factor scores above the median in self-control (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.020) and at or below the median in attention (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.022), and second-order factor scores at or below the median in attentional (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.024) and motor impulsiveness (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.046) were all associated with a greater improvement with topiramate. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION:The results indicate an association between higher within-group impulsiveness and response to topiramate for CUD. The subscore findings may suggest a complex interaction between effectiveness and known cognitive side effects. The finding that trait impulsiveness is associated with treatment response is a promising discovery that may help guide treatment for CUD. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE:This analysis suggests a possible endophenotype based on impulsiveness that can predict treatment response to topiramate. (Am J Addict 2019;XX:1-6)."}

Collective evidence suggests topiramate is an effective treatment option in AUD, with notable efficacy in reducing harmful drinking patterns in AUD. Though not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the indication of AUD, topiramate should be considered as a pharmacological treatment option with high utility among AUD patients. Early pharmacogenetic studies raise the intriguing possibility of identifying patients likely to respond to topiramate using genetic testing, and initial studies show that topiramate may also be useful in treating cocaine use disorder, smoking cessation and behavioral addictions.

Thirty apoE-deficient mice were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks a high fat diet (Control) or the same diet containing topiramate at 0.125% and 0.250%. Body weight, water and food intake were monitored throughout the study. Plasma lipids and glucose levels were measured and a glucose tolerance test was performed. Atherosclerosis development was evaluated in the whole aorta and at the aortic sinus. Histological analysis of liver, kidney and adipose tissue was performed. Topiramate did not affect weight gain and food intake. Glucose tolerance and plasma lipids were not changed and, in turn, atherosclerosis development was not different among groups. Topiramate did not modify liver and adipose tissue histology. Conversely, in the kidneys, the treatment reduced the occurrence of glomerular lipidosis by decreasing foam cells accumulation and reducing the expression of inflammatory markers. Blood urea nitrogen levels were also reduced by treatment. Our results indicate that topiramate does not affect atherosclerosis development, but preserves kidney structure and function. The study suggests that topiramate could be investigated in drug repurposing studies for the treatment of glomerular lipidosis."}

This study aimed to investigate its role in predicting diagnosis and outcome of pharmacotherapy in pediatric migraine. Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 subjects, who never took migraine-preventive agents in a pediatric clinic, including 68 patients with migraine, 30 with non-migraine headache (NM), and 22 non-headache (NH) age-matched controls. Short-term therapeutic response was measured for at least 2 weeks after the start of therapy. Responders were defined with >50% headache reduction. Plasma CGRP concentrations were measured by ELISA. Results: In the migraine group, more patients required acute therapy, as compared to the NM group (62/68, 91% vs. 5/30, 15%, p = 0.001). The mean plasma CGRP level in migraineurs either during (291 \u00b1 60 pg/ml) or between (240 \u00b1 48) attacks was higher than in NM patients (51 \u00b1 5 pg/ml, p = 0.006 and 0.018, respectively) and NH controls (53 \u00b1 6 pg/ml, p = 0.016 and 0.045, respectively). Forty-seven patients (69%) needed preventive treatments and had higher plasma CGRP levels (364 \u00b1 62 pg/ml, n = 47) than those not (183 \u00b1 54 pg/ml, n = 21) (p = 0.031). Topiramate responders had higher plasma CGRP levels than non-responders (437 \u00b1 131 pg/ml, n = 14 vs. 67 \u00b1 19 pg/ml, n = 6, p = 0.021). Survival curves of plasma CGRP levels also showed those with higher CGRP levels responded better to topiramate. Differences were not found in the other preventives. Conclusion: The plasma CGRP level can differentiate migraine from non-migraine headache. It may also serve as a reference for the therapeutic strategy since it is higher in patients requiring migraine prevention and responsive to short-term topiramate treatment. These results are clinically significant, especially for the young children who cannot clearly describe their headache symptoms and may provide new insights into the clinical practice for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric migraine."}

Short summary:The aim of the study was to assess the effect of co-administration of topiramate and ethanol on bioelectric activity of the rabbits' brain and on spatial memory in rats. Topiramate decreased ethanol-induced changes in all studied brain structures and improved memory and learning processes. Methods:A pharmaco-electroencephalography study was used to examine the effect of topiramate (25 mg/kg/day) co-administered for 6 weeks with ethanol on the bioelectric activity of the rabbits' brain. The influence of the drug was also assessed in first and second weeks of the abstinence period. Spatial memory was evaluated in rats using Morris water maze task. Topiramate (60 mg/kg/day) was administered with the ethanol for 3 weeks and for 2 weeks in the abstinence. Results:After 6 weeks of topiramate and ethanol administration, the drug decreased ethanol-induced changes in the midbrain reticular formation, hippocampus and frontal cortex. In the abstinence, the drug also inhibited the features of neuronal hyperactivity, especially in the hippocampus. Moreover, topiramate co-administered with ethanol for 3 weeks decreased ethanol-induced memory disturbance in rats. This beneficial effect was also observed in the second week of abstinence. Conclusion:These findings reveal that 'antialcoholic' activity of topiramate may be associated with its advantageous effect on memory and learning processes."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Type II diabetes is a vascular risk factor for cognitive impairment and increased risk of dementia. Disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are hallmarks of subsequent retinal edema and central nervous system dysfunction. However, the mechanisms by which diet or metabolic syndrome induces dysfunction are not understood. A proposed mechanism is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Inhibition of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase (mCA) decreases ROS and oxidative stress. In this study, topiramate, a mCA inhibitor, was examined for its ability to protect the BRB and BBB in diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. METHODS:BBB and BRB permeability were assessed using 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin in CD-1 mice fed a low-fat (control) or a high-fat diet. Topiramate administration was compared to saline controls in both preventative and efficacy arms examining BRB and BBB disruption. Body weight and blood glucose were measured weekly and body composition was assessed using EchoMRI. Metabolic activity was measured using a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Brain tissues collected from the mice were assessed for changes in oxidative stress and tight junction proteins. RESULTS:High-fat feeding caused increased entry of 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin into the brains of diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. Increased permeability to 14C-sucrose was observed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, and attenuated by topiramate treatment, while increased permeability to 99mTc-albumin occurred in the whole brain and was also attenuated by topiramate. Treatment with topiramate decreased measures of oxidative stress and increased expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-12. In the retina, we observed increased entry of 99mTc-albumin simultaneously with increased entry into the whole brain during the preventative arm. This occurred prior to increased entry to the retina for 14C-sucrose which occurred during the efficacy arm. Treatment with topiramate had no effect on the retina. CONCLUSIONS:Blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction were examined in a mouse model of diet-induced obese type II diabetes. These studies demonstrate that there are spatial and temporal differences in 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin permeability in the brain and retina of diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. Topiramate, a mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is efficacious at both preventing and treating BBB disruption in this diet-induced obese type II diabetic mouse model."}

The present study evaluated topiramate in Dual dependence on opiate and cocaine. Methods:This placebo-controlled study (Clinical Trial Registration Code: TCTR20170201001) conducted during the period 2013-2014, Cocaine-dependent individuals maintained on methadone (n=50) were randomized to receive topiramate or identical placebo capsules. Participants' dosage ranged between 25-300 mg/day (12 wk) in escalating doses. Methadone Doses started at 30 mg/day (median 100 mg/day; range 20 -140 mg/day). In addition, all subjects received brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment (BBCET). The data were analyzed by Chi-square Test, generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, linear mixed effects (LME) model and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Primary outcome measures included twelve weekly urine drug screens (cocaine abstinence, detection of benzoylecgonine) and treatment retention. Secondary outcome measures included correlation between cocaine craving with cocaine urine samples and Side effects of depression. Results:Topiramate was not better than placebo in reducing cocaine use. The secondary outcome showed that Topiramate was better than placebo in reducing cocaine craving. The mean [99% confidence interval (CI)] scores of cocaine craving were 24.31 (18.61-30.01) in experimental group and 21.84 (16.86-26.81) in control group (all P > 0.01). Retention and correlation between cocaine craving and cocaine urine samples were not significantly different between the groups. Topiramate usage was not associated with increase in depression symptoms as a side effect (P>0.05). Conclusion:The efficacy of topiramate in cocaine treatment is limited and needs the similar controlled clinical trials and can be used as a complementary intervention."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Topiramate (TMP) is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant drug used to treat a wide variety of seizure disorders, for migraine prophylaxis, and for many other indications. An important side effect of TMP is metabolic acidosis, which is mediated by renal tubular defects. TMP inhibits carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that is necessary for acid handling in the proximal renal tubule. Patients can present with asymptomatic serum electrolyte derangements, acute change in mental status, hyperventilation, cardiac arrhythmias, or other sequelae of metabolic acidosis and associated respiratory compensation. If taken chronically, TMP can cause renal stone formation, bone mineralization defects, and several other effects secondary to changes in serum and urine pH and electrolytes. There is no well-studied way to prevent metabolic acidosis in patients taking TMP, but physicians should be vigilant when prescribing this drug to patients with the history of renal diseases and other comorbidities, and aware of this potential etiology of metabolic acidosis. We present a literature review of the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of renal tubular acidosis secondary to TMP and its clinical consequences."}

The current systematic review and network meta-analysis analyzes and provides an update on the clinical performance of these add-ons in comparison to placebo on body weight and body mass index (BMI) reductions. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on electronic databases: PubMed (1946-), Embase (1974-), Cochrane library (1992-), and OpenGrey (2000-) until 31 July 2018. Network meta-analyses, comparing the body weight change, BMI change and withdrawn due to adverse events of different pharmacological add-ons, was performed using a multivariate meta-regression model with random-effects, adopting a frequentist approach. To rank the prognosis for all add-ons, we used surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values. Outcomes: From 614 potential studies identified, 27 eligible studies (n = 1,349 subjects) were included. All the studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias. For the analysis of body weight change, all add-ons except Ranitidine showed significant weight reductions comparing to placebo. The effectiveness rank based on SUCRA results from highest to lowest was Sibutramine, Topiramate, Metformin, Reboxetine, Ranitidine, and placebo. A similar pattern was seen for BMI change. The analysis of safety outcome did not detect significantly increased withdrawn number from the add-ons. Current evidence showed relatively good tolerance and safety of using the pharmacological add-ons. Interpretation: Topiramate and Metformin are effective add-on treatments in controlling antipsychotic-induced weight gain, comparing to placebo. They are well tolerated in short-term period. Although Sibutramine has the highest rank of the effectiveness, its license has been withdrawn in many countries due to its adverse effects. Hence, Sibutramine should not be adopted to treat antipsychotic-induced weight gain."}

Antiepileptic drugs often use in reproductive age, through reproductive progress and maturation. On the other side, cold-pressed oils are rich in bioactive phytochemicals with health-promoting traits. The target of this work was to appraise the sexual dysfunction of antiepileptic Topiramate (TPM) and cold pressed ginger oil (CPGO) as antiepileptic alternative medicine in male mice. Fifty-four adult male albino mice were divided into nine groups (n\u2009=\u20096 mice). One group given saline and used as negative control; another one was given corn oil as vehicle. Six groups administered orally with TPM or CPGO at 100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg. Moreover, group of animals co-administrated orally CPGO with TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) to study their interaction. Fatty acid profile and tocols composition of CPGO were determined. in vitro assays were undertaken to evaluate radical scavenging traits of CPGO utilizing sable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH\u00b7) and galvinoxyl radicals. The study investigated antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, sexual hormones levels, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa), synaptonemal complex protein (Sycp3), Wilms tumor gene (Wt1) as well as histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Strong radical scavenging potential of CPGO against stable DPPH\u00b7 and galvinoxyl radicals was recorded. The results revealed that TPM caused a dose-dependent reduction in the antioxidant activities and testosterone content, while, malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) as oxidative stress markers were elevated. Vegfa and Sycp3 mRNA expression down-regulated at all Topiramate tested doses, but Wt1 up-regulated at 400\u2009mg/kg. TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) revealed histological alterations associated with strong positive Bax immune reactive spermatogoneal and Leydig cells. Ginger oil elevated the CAT and SOD (antioxidant enzymes), serum testosterone and diminished the oxidative stress, up regulated the expression of Vegfa and Sycp3 and down-regulated the Wt1 expression. Meanwhile, CPGO revealed no histopathological alterations and no Bax immune-reactive cells. CPGO co-administration with TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) attenuated the TPM toxicity. High doses of TPM may exhibit sexual dysfunction but CPGO is safe and has androgenic property. CPGO co-administration could protect the antiepileptic patient from the TPM sexual dysfunction."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "PURPOSE/BACKGROUND:Topiramate (TPM) and lorazepam (LZP) are two examples of frequently prescribed medications that are associated with a high incidence of cognitive impairment; however, the factors that underlie interindividual differences in side effect profiles have not been fully characterized. Our objective was to determine whether working memory capacity (WMC), the amount of information that can be stored and manipulated in memory over short time intervals, is one such factor. METHODS/PROCEDURES:Twenty-nine healthy volunteers completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study during which they received placebo (PBO), TPM, and LZP in random order. Four hours after drug administration, a blood draw was taken to establish drug concentrations, and subjects performed a verbal working memory task while the accuracy and reaction time of their responses were recorded. Working memory capacity was calculated based on accuracy rates during the PBO session, and the role of WMC in moderating the severity of drug-related cognitive impairment was assessed by examining drug-related performance changes from PBO as a function of WMC. FINDINGS/RESULTS:Both TPM and LZP had a negative impact on task performance, although only TPM-related deficits were modulated by WMC; high WMC was associated with more severe impairments and heightened sensitivity to increasing TPM concentrations. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS:We have identified a potential clinical risk factor, high WMC, which is associated with drug-related adverse cognitive events. These data provide objective evidence in support of clinical observations that high-functioning patients are more likely to experience severe cognitive impairments."}

The effects of prophylactic therapy on allodynia in patients with migraine were assessed based on the change in pain threshold after therapy. Patients and methods:A total of 71 patients with migraine admitted to the Department of Neurology of Shandong Provincial Hospital were recruited in this study. The included patients were aged 18-70 years and did not present positive symptoms according to the nervous system examination. The variation in cutaneous allodynia was assessed for the role of classic prophylactic therapy in migraine-related allodynia, also termed as central sensitization (CS). Patients with migraine were randomized into two groups (topiramate and flunarizine groups), and the effect of drugs was evaluated by the change in cutaneous pain threshold between the two groups. Fifty-five patients were tested for pain threshold due to instrument failure. Pressure allodynia was measured with a force gage, and pricking was measured with Electronic von Frey Anesthesiometer. The pain threshold was measured every 3 months for 6 months. The variations in pain threshold after treatment were compared using t-test and \u03c7 2 test. Results:Allodynia was seen in 70.4% of the patients; of these, 76.3% were females. Female gender, duration of illness, and frequency of migraine attacks per month were significantly associated with allodynia. The rate of allodynia and frequency of headache declined significantly, the number of patients with allodynia was reduced, and the pain threshold improved dramatically after treatment. The composite adverse events were low after treatment with topiramate and flunarizine. Conclusion:Allodynia was observed, especially in females who experienced frequent migraine attacks for a prolonged period. Gender, duration of illness, and number of migraine attacks per month were the major predictors of allodynia. Topiramate and flunarizine administered orally for a short duration can effectively improve the pain threshold and CS of patients with migraine, and efficiently relieve allodynia."}

Major databases were searched until June 1, 2018. Of 3,709 search engine hits, 27 meta-analyses were included, representing 128 meta-analyzed trials and 47,231 study participants. While meta-analyses were generally of adequate or high quality, meta-analyzed studies were less so. The most effective weight reduction interventions were individual lifestyle counseling (standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.98) and exercise interventions (SMD=-0.96), followed by psychoeducation (SMD=-0.77), aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.73), topiramate (SMD=-0.72), d-fenfluramine (SMD=-0.54) and metformin (SMD=-0.53). Regarding waist circumference reduction, aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-1.10) and topiramate (SMD=-0.69) demonstrated the best evidence, followed by dietary interventions (SMD=-0.39). Dietary interventions were the only to significantly improve (diastolic) blood pressure (SMD=-0.39). Switching from olanzapine to quetiapine or aripiprazole (SMD=-0.71) and metformin (SMD=-0.65) demonstrated best efficacy for reducing glucose levels, followed by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (SMD=-0.39), dietary interventions (SMD=-0.37) and aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.34), whereas insulin resistance improved the most with metformin (SMD=-0.75) and rosiglitazone (SMD=-0.44). Topiramate had the greatest efficacy for triglycerides (SMD=-0.68) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (SMD=-0.80), whereas metformin had the greatest beneficial effects on total cholesterol (SMD=-0.51) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (SMD=0.45). Lifestyle interventions yielded small effects for triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (SMD=-0.35 to -0.37). Only exercise interventions increased exercise capacity (SMD=1.81). Despite frequent physical comorbidities and premature mortality mainly due to these increased physical health risks, the current evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in people with schizophrenia to prevent and treat these conditions is still limited and more larger trials are urgently needed."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a key neuropeptide involved in the activation of the trigeminovascular system and it is likely related to migraine chronification. Here, we investigated the role of CGRP in an animal model that mimics the chronic migraine condition via repeated and intermittent nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. We also evaluated the modulatory effect of topiramate on this experimental paradigm. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with NTG (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, every 2 days over a 9-day period (5 total injections). A group of animals was injected with topiramate (30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or saline every day for 9\u00a0days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of NTG or vehicle, animals underwent tail flick test and orofacial Von Frey test. Rats were subsequently sacrificed to evaluate c-Fos and CGRP gene expression in medulla-pons region, cervical spinal cord and trigeminal ganglia. RESULTS:NTG administration induced spinal hyperalgesia and orofacial allodynia, together with a significant increase in the expression of CGRP and c-Fos genes in trigeminal ganglia and central areas. Topiramate treatment prevented NTG-induced changes by reversing NTG-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and inhibiting CGRP and c-Fos gene expression in all areas evaluated. CONCLUSIONS:These findings point to the role of CGRP in the processes underlying migraine chronification and suggest a possible interaction with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate transmission to induce/maintain central sensitization and to contribute to the dysregulation of descending pain system involved in chronic migraine."}

Method:This was a 5 week, between-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study with topiramate [0 mg/day (placebo), 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day] and aripiprazole [0 mg/day (placebo), 7.5 mg/day, 15 mg/day] in 90 non-treatment seeking, heavy drinking, alcohol-dependent individuals. Main outcomes were the efficacy of 200 mg/day topiramate and 15 mg/day aripiprazole, alone and combined, in reducing drinks consumed during an alcohol self-administration procedure (human laboratory phase) and while receiving the study medications prior to the laboratory session (naturalistic drinking phase). Other outcomes in the laboratory phase included alcohol craving, and alcohol biphasic effects. Results:In the human laboratory phase, topiramate 200 mg/day reduced alcohol craving [**P < 0.01] and amplified alcohol-induced stimulation [*P < 0.05], but did not reduce the number of drinks consumed. Topiramate 200 mg/day was also effective in reducing drinking days [*P < 0.05], and alcohol craving [*P < 0.05], in the naturalistic drinking phase. No significant findings were found for aripiprazole for any of the outcomes analyzed. Conclusion:Participants receiving 200 mg/day topiramate reported reduced alcohol drinking and craving, and increased alcohol-related stimulation. These findings provide further support for the role of topiramate as a pharmacological treatment for AUD. ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier:NCT00884884. Short Summary:This study tested topiramate and aripiprazole alone and in combination. The results replicate past findings and suggest that topiramate may be an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder.

METHODS:Data of the LTG concentration and clinical information were analyzed retrospectively from a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database at the Clinical Pharmacy Laboratory of Xi'an Central Hospital between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2018. The independent-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni and Tamhane T3 post-hoc test, the stepwise multivariate regression analysis were adopted by IBM SPSS, version 22.0. RESULTS:226 serum samples met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The mean LTG serum concentration was 5.48\u00b13.83 \u03bcg/mL. There were no gender differences (P = 0.64), and there were no significant effects by age on LTG serum concentration after age stratification (3-14 years old, 14-45 years old, 45-59 years old) (P = 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that the daily LTG dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentrations. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, the mean steady-state LTG concentration could be decreased by 30.73% compared with LTG monotherapy. Among enzyme-inducer AEDs, particularly strong inducer Carbamazepine (CBZ) could decrease the mean LTG concentration by 53.65%, but weak inducer AEDs such as Oxcarbazepine (OXC) and Topiramate (TPM) had no effect, Valproic acid (VPA) could increase the mean LTG concentration by 93.95%, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination. CONCLUSIONS:There were no significant gender and age effects, but the LTG daily dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentration. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, especially CBZ could significantly decrease LTG serum concentrations, VPA could significantly increase LTG serum concentrations, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination. In the clinical setting, these findings can help to estimate LTG concentrations and adjust dosage and evaluate adverse drug reactions."}

In 40 patients, the mean urinary calcium/creatinine ratio increased over time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mean serum bicarbonate in 40 patients decreased over time (P\u00a0< 0.01). Twenty-three children had urinary calcium/creatinine ratios before topiramate. Nine children with baseline hypercalciuria (defined as urinary calcium/creatinine >0.21) were compared with the 14 children with baseline normal urinary calcium excretion. A greater increase in urinary calcium/creatinine ratios occurred in hypercalciuric children (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a greater decrease in serum bicarbonate levels occurred in the hypercalciuric children (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with children with baseline normal calcium excretion.

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Cannabis is the most commonly abused illicit drug and accounts for the greatest number of adolescent substance abuse treatment admissions. Despite urgent need for effective interventions, the best available psychosocial treatment options yield only modest effects. Topiramate showed promise as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy to a psychosocial intervention for cannabis misuse among adolescents and young adults in a recent clinical trial, but it was not well tolerated. This study investigated associations between clinical characteristics and side effects and dropout among adolescents and young adults randomized to topiramate.This study involved secondary data analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of topiramate for treating cannabis misuse (ages, 15-24 years; 50% female). We explored the interaction effects of baseline characteristics and medication condition (topiramate vs placebo) on treatment dropout. We also explored the relationship between side effects and dropout.Higher cannabis problems were significantly associated with reduced hazard of dropout in the topiramate group (P = 0.048) and were nonsignificantly associated with increased hazard of dropout in the placebo group (P = 0.062). Results also showed that memory difficulties were an overwhelming predictor of dropout in the topiramate condition; 42% of participants who dropped out experienced memory difficulties, whereas none of those who remained in the study experienced these effects.By identifying who may most benefit from and tolerate this medication, treatment for substance use disorders can become more individualized and positive outcomes may be enhanced."}

Data were collected from patients who used topiramate, phentermine, and/or metformin postoperatively. Percentage of patients achieving \u22655%, \u226510%, or \u226515% weight loss on medications was determined and percent weight change on each medication was compared to percent weight change of the rest of the cohort. Our results showed that 54.1% of study patients lost \u22655% of their postsurgical weight; 34.3% and 22.9% lost \u226510% and \u226515%, respectively. RYGB had higher median percent weight loss (-8.1%) than SG (-3.3%) (p = 0.0515). No difference was found in median percent weight loss with medications started at weight plateau (-6.0%) versus after weight regain (-5.4%) (p = 0.5304). Patients taking medications at weight loss plateau lost 41.2% of total body weight from before surgery versus 27.1% after weight regain (p = 0.076). Median percent weight change on metformin was -2.9% compared to the rest of the cohort at -7.7% (p = 0.0241). No difference from the rest of the cohort was found for phentermine (p = 0.2018) or topiramate (p = 0.3187). Topiramate, phentermine, and metformin are promising weight loss medications for 21 to 30 year olds. RYGB patients achieve more weight loss on medications but both RYGB and SG benefit. Median total body weight loss from pre-surgical weight may be higher in patients that start medication at postsurgical nadir weight. Participants on metformin lost significantly smaller percentages of weight on medications, which could be the result of underlying medical conditions."}

We aimed to comprehensively compare different augmentation agents for treatment-resistant OCD in adults. METHODS:PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, the WHO's ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched on February 20, 2018. Pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis were performed. The primary outcome was efficacy measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. The secondary outcomes were tolerability (side-effect discontinuation) and acceptability (all cause discontinuation). Mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS:Thirty-three articles with 34 trials (1216 patients) were included. Memantine (MD, -8.94; 95% CI, -14.42 to -3.42), risperidone (-4.47, -8.75 to -0.17), topiramate (-6.05, -10.89 to -1.20), lamotrigine (-6.07, -11.61 to -0.50), and aripiprazole (-5.14, -9.95 to -0.28) were significantly superior to placebo. Antipsychotic (-4.09, -6.22 to -1.93) and glutamatergic (-5.22, -7.53 to -2.84) agents were significantly superior to placebo. Considerable heterogeneity was found across studies, and baseline symptom severity was identified as a significant moderator. After baseline severity adjustment, quetiapine (-5.00, -8.59 to -1.29) and olanzapine (-8.28, -15.34 to -1.13) became significantly superior to placebo. CONCLUSIONS:Our study supports the use of antipsychotic or glutamatergic agents as augmentation agents for treatment-resistant OCD. Topiramate, lamotrigine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, memantine, and quetiapine are alternative augmentation drugs; however, a definitive conclusion of the best drug remains undetermined because of the considerable heterogeneity and limited numbers of studies and patients for each agent."}

The present study aimed at investigating the neuroprotective potential of TPM on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced striatal neurodegeneration and Huntington's disease-like symptoms. Rats were injected with 3-NP (10\u202fmg/kg/i.p.) for 14 days. TPM (50\u202fmg/kg/p.o.) was given once a day, 1\u202fh before 3-NP. TPM amended 3-NP induced changes in neurobehavioral performance, striatal neurotransmitters levels and histopathological injury. 3-NP control rats showed a significant ablation in the mRNA expression of Ca2+-impermeable Glu2R subunit along with an elevation in its regulatory protein (protein interacting with C kinase-1) PICK1, an effect that was largely reversed by TPM. TPM in addition, enhanced the phosphorylation of the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2/cAMP response element binding protein (Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/CREB) cue. Moreover, improvement in oxidative status, suppression of caspase-3 activity and restoration of striatal BDNF were noticed following treatment with TPM.

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "PURPOSE:The literature on topiramate use in cocaine-dependent patients was reviewed. SUMMARY:Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of topiramate in patients who were cocaine dependent were analyzed. The results from the studies indicated that topiramate, when used in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy, may be effective in reducing short-term cocaine use and should be considered as a possible treatment option. Other trials suggested that topiramate was not effective in patients with a dual diagnosis of opioid and cocaine dependence. Two trials suggested that short-term abstinence assisted by pharmacotherapy is a predictor of longer-term (6 months and 1 year, respectively) abstinence. Cocaine use is dependent on multiple factors; therefore, a reduction in use or craving is not definitively associated with abstinence. However, decreased use reduces potential patient harm and the amount of money spent on illicit cocaine. The findings of this literature review should be used to encourage the completion of more trials that are appropriately designed. Topiramate was shown to be effective for increasing cocaine abstinence, the proportion of cocaine nonuse days, and the proportion of patients to attain 3 consecutive weeks of cocaine abstinence and decreasing the abuse liability of cocaine. Conflicting results in clinical trials do not provide a definitive answer regarding topiramate's efficacy in managing cocaine dependence. CONCLUSION:Available research neither validates nor invalidates the hypothesis that topiramate is efficacious in attaining abstinence in cocaine-dependent patients."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Topiramate is a well-known anticonvulsant drug with a broad spectrum of actions. It has been proposed in the treatment of several types of epileptic seizures both in monotherapy and in add-on. Its usage has been extended to other disorders including migraine, essential tremor, obesity, alcohol and drug addiction. The most frequent side-effects of topiramate include dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and ataxia. Paraesthesia, metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, hypohidrosis, cognitive impairment and eye symptoms have also been reported. CASE REPORT:We report on a girl affected by epileptic seizures treated with levetiracetam for five years. Due to worsening of the seizures, the dosage of this drug was increased and afterwards lowdosage topiramate was initiated. After 12 days from the introduction of topiramate, the girl began to present neurologic signs including limbs rigidity, pain, incoordination and flexed fingers. Gradual withdrawn of the topiramate resulted in progressive resolution of the symptomatology. This clinical episode could represent a probable topiramate-related side effect (Naranjo score 5), never reported before in this form."}

In certain circumstances, conventional drugs such as diazepam and phenobarbital cannot be used and the need for alternative medicines is felt. This study compared the effectiveness of topiramate and diazepam in preventing the risk of recurrent febrile seizure in children under 2 yr old. Materials and Methods:This randomized controlled trial, in Besat Hospital in Hamedan, Iran from 22 Nov 2013 to 22 Nov 2015 (Registered code: IRCT Number: IRCT2015010120527N1), included 54 patients, at risk of recurrent febrile seizure, inhibited from taking phenobarbital. Samples were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received diazepam treatment during fever episodes and the second group received daily dose of topiramate. A one-year follow-up of recurrent febrile seizure and its complications was also conducted. Results:Thirty-four patients (17 patients in each group) completed the one-year course of the trial. Recurrent febrile seizure was not observed in the course of preventive treatment. The prevalence of minor complications was 29.4% in the diazepam group and 48.5% in the topiramate group. No major complication was observed in among the subjects. Conclusion:Topiramate can be recommended for preventing recurrent febrile seizure when the use of frontline medicines is not possible."}

In association with clinical observations, the analysis of plasmatic concentration of TPM is of utmost importance for the individual adjustment of the administered dose to the patient. In the present work, a bioanalytical method was developed and validated for TPM analysis in plasma samples by capillary electrophoresis with capacitively-coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-C4 D). A simple background electrolyte composed of 15 mmol/L triethylamine, hydrodynamic injections (0.8 psi for 5 s) and a moderate separation voltage (20 kV) were used, rendering relatively short analysis times (<3 min). The sample pre-treatment was carried out by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl terc-butyl ether as solvent and 200 \u03bcL of plasma. The method was validated according to the official guidelines from the European Medicine Agency and showed linearity in plasmatic concentration range from 1 to 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, which covers the clinically-relevant interval. The lower limit of quantification of 1 \u03bcg/mL obtained also allows following patients with low dosage of the drug. The method was successfully applied to analysis of plasma samples and allowed the identification of 80% under-medicated patients in the analyzed patient pool."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Migraine is the sixth most common cause of disability in the world. Preventive migraine treatment is used to reduce frequency, severity and duration of attacks and therefore lightens the burden on the patients' quality of life and reduces disability. Topiramate is one of the preventive migraine treatments of proven efficacy. The mechanism of action underlying the preventive effect of topiramate in migraine remains largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we examined the central effects of a single dose of topiramate (100mg) on trigeminal pain in humans, compared to placebo (mannitol). In this prospective, within subject, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study, 23 healthy participants received a standardized nociceptive trigeminal stimulation and control stimuli whilst being in the scanner. No differences in the subjective intensity ratings of the painful stimuli were observed between topiramate and placebo sessions. In contrast, topiramate significantly decreased the activity in the thalamus and other pain processing areas. Additionally, topiramate increased functional coupling between the thalamus and several brain regions such as the bilateral precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex. These data suggest that topiramate exhibits modulating effects on nociceptive processing in thalamo-cortical networks during trigeminal pain and that the preventive effect of topiramate on frequent migraine is probably mediated by an effect on thalamo-cortical networks."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to provide an evaluation of the benefits and adverse effects (AEs) of psychiatric and seizure medications commonly used for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS:As part of the National Survey on Treatment Effectiveness for Autism, we report ratings of 26 psychiatric and seizure medications by 505 participants. Each medication was rated with a standardized scale for overall benefits, overall AEs, and specific symptoms affected. The frequency of use and net perceived benefit (overall benefit minus overall AE) are reported. RESULTS:Most medications were rated as having a slightly greater benefit than AE. Six medications (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, clonidine, guanfacine, buspirone, and sertraline) had benefit ratings that were more than twice their adverse rating. Conversely, some medications had slightly negative net benefit ratings (worse AEs than benefits on average), including Adderall, Paroxetine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, and Topiramate. However, there were wide variations in individual ratings of benefit and AEs, suggesting that clinical response to medications was highly variable, so these scores simply represent averages. A ranking of the top medications (those with the highest net perceived benefit) for each of 18 different symptoms is provided, which may provide some clinical guidance as to which medications may be most worth considering for a given symptom. A comparison of the survey results with the results of clinical trials shows generally good agreement in terms of medication benefits with some differences; in some cases the differences are because the clinical trials did not assess all of the symptoms assessed by this survey. CONCLUSIONS:It is hoped that physicians and their patients will find the survey results useful in selecting the most promising medications for a given symptom, and also for monitoring for likely benefits and AEs, especially for medications for which few or no studies have been carried out in ASD populations."}

Neuropathic pain is common and important and has inappropriate complications, and despite their importance, there is no effective treatment for them.Because of the importance of neuropathic pain and safe and effective treatment, in this study, we determined the effect of topiramate versus gabapentin in patients with neuropathic pain.In this randomized clinical trial, 30 patients with pain attributed to neuropathy who had at least one month of neuropathic pain in one area, were randomized to receive either gabapentin, titrated from 300 mg/day to a maximum of 900 mg/day or topiramate, titrated from 50 mg/day to a maximum of 100 mg/day after a 4-week period in the neurology clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital of Urmia city, Iran in 2015. Complication, drug tolerance rate and pain were investigated. The pain was measured on visual analog scale (VAS). The data were analyzed by SPSS version 18, and using descriptive statistics, t-test, and ANOVA.In patients treated by gabapentin, the primary pain score was 74.33\u00b110.29, this score decreased to 49.46\u00b111.41 and 29.93\u00b111.92 in the second and fourth week after intervention with gabapentin. In topiramate treated patients, the primary score was 76.00\u00b19.69. It decreased to 54.33\u00b110.31 and 34.20\u00b16.09 at the same time. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of average reduction of pain intensity [gabapentin group (59.73%) compared with topiramate (55%) (p=0.48)].

CASES:Two middle-aged women experienced sudden onset of acute glaucoma and acquired myopia after taking topiramate. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated bilateral ciliochoroidal effusion and angle closure. The A-scan ultrasonography revealed shallow anterior chamber and thick lens. After the treatment\u00a0and drug withdrawal, intraocular pressure, refractive status and angle anatomy returned to normal and there was resolution of ciliochoroidal effusion. During the clinical course, the anterior chamber depth (ACD) increased from 2.02 to 3.30\u00a0mm (1.28\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 1.94 to 3.36\u00a0mm (1.42\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The lens thickness (LT) became thinner from 4.53 to 4.31\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 4.59 to 4.30\u00a0mm (0.29\u00a0mm of changes) OS in the first case. In the second case, the ACD increased from 2.33 to 3.07\u00a0mm (0.74\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 2.30 to 3.05\u00a0mm (0.75\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The LT became thinner from 4.42 to 4.27\u00a0mm (0.15\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 4.38 to 4.26\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm contributed more to the shallowness of the anterior chamber than the thickening of the lens itself (only accounting for 20%). CONCLUSION:Topiramate-induced bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift was due to ciliochoroidal effusion which resulted in thicker lens and shallow anterior chamber. The later was mainly due to anterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm."}
{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Topiramate (TPM) decreases cytokine release and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cytokine and endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion and ROS formation play an important role in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We aimed to evaluate whether TPM prevents damage occurring in lung tissue during I/R. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A total of 27 Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups of nine. To the I/R group, two hours of ischemia via infrarenal abdominal aorta cross-ligation and then two hours of reperfusion process were applied. TPM (100 mg/kg/day) orally for seven days was administered in the TPM treatment group. After the last dose of TPM treatment, respectively, two hours of ischemia and two hours of reperfusion were applied in this group. RESULTS:Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (p < 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05), myeloperoxidase (MPO) (p < 0.05) and ET-1 (p < 0.05) levels of TPM treatment group's lung tissue were significantly lower than for the I/R group. Caspase-3 and histopathological damage were rather lower than that of the I/R group. CONCLUSIONS:During I/R, lung damage occurs due to excessive TNF-\u03b1 and ET-1 release and ROS generation. TPM could well reduce development of lung damage by decreasing cytokine and ET-1 release and levels of ROS produced."}

It showed that topiramate-treated female fish had reduced oocyte maturation, and the survival rates of their offspring were seriously decreased during embryogenesis. In addition, around 23% of offspring displayed cartilage malformation in the craniofacial area, such as loss of ceratobranchial cartilages as well as impaired ceratohyal, Meckel's cartilage and ethmoid plate development. Moreover, mineralization of ceratohyal, Meckel's cartilage, and vertebrae were downregulated during bone development.

Current therapies are limited, leaving up to 50% of patients symptomatic despite treatment, underscoring the need for additional treatment options. Qsymia, an FDA-approved medication for obesity, combines phentermine and topiramate ER. Topiramate has demonstrated efficacy for both BED and BN, but limited tolerability. Phentermine is FDA-approved for weight loss. A rationale for combined phentermine/topiramate for BED and BN is improved tolerability and efficacy. While a prior case series exploring Qsymia for BED showed promise, randomized studies are needed to evaluate Qsymia's safety and efficacy when re-purposed in eating disorders. We present a study protocol for a Phase I/IIa single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial examining safety and preliminary efficacy of Qsymia for BED and BN. METHODS:Adults with BED (n=15) or BN (n=15) are randomized 1:1 to receive 12weeks Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate ER, 3.75mg/23mg-15mg/92mg) or placebo, followed by 2-weeks washout and 12-weeks crossover, where those on Qsymia receive placebo and vice versa.

Secondary outcomes include average number of binge episodes, percentage abstinence from binge eating, and changes in weight/vitals, eating psychopathology, and mood. DISCUSSION:To our knowledge this is the first randomized, double-blind protocol investigating the safety and efficacy of phentermine/topiramate in BED and BN. We highlight the background and rationale for this study, including the advantages of a crossover design.

The objective of present study is to determine which antipsychotic medication is highly effective in a real-world clinical setting considering adjuvant pharmacotherapy over a 10-year follow-up period.MethodsA total of 2300 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at the Seoul National University Hospital, and participants received amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone for up to 10-years. Time-to-discontinuation of antipsychotic medications was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Group differences were compared using log-rank tests.ResultsThe most frequently used drugs were Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Olanzapine in the antipsychotic drug, Valproate, Lamotrigine, Topiramate in the anticonvulsant agents, Escitalopram, Sertraline, Milnacipran in antidepressants, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Zolpidem in anxiolytics or sedatives, Propranolol, Benztropine, Trihexyphenidyl in antiparkinson drugs. About half of the patients discontinued taking antipsychotics before 1.5 years. Clozapine showed significantly longer time to discontinuations compared to other antipsychotic drugs. Aripiprazole also showed a lower incidence of discontinuation except for Clozapine and Olanzapine.DiscussionClozapine was found to be the most effective antipsychotics in terms of time to discontinuations. Aripiprazole is the most highly recommended 1st line antipsychotics."}

The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the dose, use of other AEDs on TPM plasma concentration (Cp ), and frequency of epileptic seizures. A cross-sectional analytical study was developed with patients aged 18-60\u00a0years, for diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy, using TPM in monotherapy or associated with other AEDs. The following variables were analyzed: age, frequency of epileptic seizures, pharmacotherapeutic regimen with its respective doses, adherence to medication treatment, and adverse events score. Thirty-seven patients were included, 83.8% of the patients presented Cp below the therapeutic range. Multiple linear regression estimated that the increase of 1.0\u00a0mg/kg/d promoted an increase of 0.68\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in TPMCp , while the use of inducers predicted a reduction of 2.97\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Multiple Poisson regression predicts that an increase of 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in TPMCp decreased the patient's chance of presenting seizures, and patients using AED inducers were about ten times more likely to present seizures than those who do not use (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, for patients using AED inducers with Cp below the therapeutic range, the mean number of seizures per month was greater than those with Cp within the therapeutic range. The prescribed dose and the use of AED inducers influence Cp of TPM, likewise the low Cp of first-line AEDs and of the adjuvant in the treatment, TPM, as well as low TPM dose seem to affect the control of epileptic seizures."}

One hundred males (Age range=18\u201334; SD=4.11) undergoing abstinence were assigned randomly to four groups (n=25) of Topiramate (TPM), Contingency Management (CM) and the Combined Method plus a placebo control group. Treatment was provided for twelve weeks for the experiment groups, and only the control group received the placebo. Participants in the Cash-based and CM Condition had an identical 12-week escalating schedule of reinforcement (cash-based incentives worth $0, $20, $40, and $80). Also, in the Topiramate group, participants\u2019 dosage ranged between 25\u2013300 mg/day in escalating doses) 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300). In addition, all subjects received brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment (BBCET). Participants took a urine test twice a week, with a given threshold of > 300 ng/ml, and indicators of cocaine craving (response rate= 91%) was evaluated in two phases of pre-test and post-test. We used Chi square, ANCOVA Univariate Model and Scheffe\u2019s post hoc to analyze the primary and secondary outcomes. Also, the qualitative data resulted from demographic evaluations were coded and analyzed by the instrument of analysis of qualitative data i.e. Atlas.ti, Version 5.2.ResultsThe results showed that all three types of treatment played a significant efficacy in reducing the craving. The mean (95% CI) scores of craving was 12.04 (p=0.05) with TPM, 13.89 (p=0.05) with CM, 10.92 (p=0.01) with Mix and 16.89 (p>0.05) with control. Moreover, the highest variance explaining the changes in craving was assigned to the combined treatment (p<0.01).ConclusionsThe findings of this study, while having applicable aspects in this domain, can be helpful in planning supplementary remedial procedures.Trial registrationThe trial was registered at the Thai Clinical Trial Registration Center with the TCR ID: TCTR20170112001.FundingThe authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}

Clinical trials demonstrated that topiramate augmentation was effective in controlling negative symptoms in schizophrenia. This case report presents a case of a 38-year-old man with schizophrenia who achieved full negative symptom remission upon the adjunctive use of topiramate. However, the remarkable finding of this case is the concomitant decrease in the level of prolactin when topiramate (50 mg/day) was started and the rebound after discontinuation of topiramate. Previous studies stated that topiramate could prevent antipsychotic-induced weight gain and adverse metabolic effects. To the authors' knowledge, no study has reported that topiramate augmentation could be a treatment strategy for antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia. This finding could be verified by well-designed clinical trials."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS:The leaf extract of M. piperita was prepared using cold water method. The three microbial strains, i.e., Streptococcus mutans, Aggregatibacter actinomycetem-comitans, and Candida albicans were used as microbiological materials. Chlorhexidine 0.2% was used as positive control. The digital caliper was used to measure the zone of inhibition to know the antimicrobial activity at 24 and 48 hours. To compare the activity within and between the different microbial strains, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. To analyze the data, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version of 21.0 was used. The p-value \u22640.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS:Maximum inhibition zone was seen in both M. piperita extracts and 0.2% chlorhexidine with S. mutans at 24 and 48 hours, followed by A. actinomycetemcomitans, and C. albi-cans respectively. The statistical analysis ANOVA reveals the statistically significant association of M. piperita extracts with p-value <0.001. The comparison with 0.2% chlorhexidine at 24 hours showed a p-value of <0.04 and at 48 hours, it showed a p-value <0.001, which was statistically significant. CONCLUSION:The present study concluded that M. piperita showed antimicrobial activity against the oral microorganisms which are causing major less or more severe oral diseases and it can be administered as an alternative medicine for the conventional treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:The study results serve as a guide in selecting and providing information about the efficacy of M. piperita extracts to the dental professionals. The discovery of a potential herbal medication would be a great development in the field of antimicrobial therapies."}

These bacteria cause organoleptic changes such as increased turbidity, haziness and sour odor. In addition, they are able to form biofilms on the inner parts of production lines, and finally they can cause secondary contamination of final products. For this reason, new methods using effective and safe preservatives are being developed to improve microbial stability of soft beverages. The aim of the research was to investigate the effects of Mentha piperita L. ethanol extract against Asaia spp. biofilm formation. The bacterial adhesion was evaluated by a plate count method and luminometry, as well as fluorescence microscopy. The polyphenolic profile of the mint extract was determined on the basis of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The obtained microbiological results indicate bacteriostatic effect of mint extract at 10% (v/v) concentration.

Most of the time, foods deteriorate through the growth of microorganisms or oxidation process. Essential oils (EOs) derived from plant material have well-documented antioxidant and antibacterial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Zataria multiflora Boiss EO (ZEO) and Mentha piperita EO (MEO) on the chemical stability of minced meat during storage at 7\u00b0C. Materials and Methods:Total phenolic content, \u03b2-Carotene bleaching test, ferric reducing antioxidant potential assay, and 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity were used to determine the antioxidant potential of EOs. Five different groups including control, ZEO 0.3%, ZEO 0.5%, MEO 0.3%, and MEO 0.5% were designed to assess the chemical stability of minced meat by measuring pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN), and peroxide value (PV). Results:pH did not have any significant change during storage. TBA values in the control group were significantly higher than the treatment groups, especially from the 5th day of storage. TVBN in the treatment group was significantly lower than the control group during storage. PV values in the treatment group were significantly lower than the control group during storage. Conclusion:Results indicate that ZEO and MEO had an excellent antioxidant activity and retarded the spoilage process in minced meat."}

On the other hand, increased commercialization of AgNPs containing products has led to its release into the environment. Thus, studies are needed to assess their impact on the environment as well as on human body. Several reports have shown that AgNPs could cause some serious neurotoxic effects. Most of these studies have been performed using chemically synthesized AgNPs. In contrast, green nanoparticles are usually considered safer than their chemically synthesized counterparts. Accordingly, in this research work, we have assessed the effect of AgNPs synthesized from aqueous-leaf-extract of Mentha piperita on one of the most important neurological enzymes i.e. acetylcholinesterase (AChE) to predict its neurotoxicity. M. piperita synthesized AgNPs were subjected to characterization by UV-visible-spectrometry, Scanning Electron-Microscopy as well as Transmission Electron-Microscopy. Here, the size of the AgNPs was found to be 35\u202fnm with spherical shape. These AgNPs showed concentration-dependent inhibitory-effect on the AChE enzyme-activity displaying an IC50 of 150\u202fnM. Further, kinetic analysis showed mixed type of inhibition, which means that AgNPs were capable of binding to both the free enzyme (AChE) and to the enzyme-substrate (AChE-acetylcholine) complex. These results suggest that even green synthesized AgNPs might cause neurotoxicity via inhibiting AChE activity. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanism of neurotoxicity by AgNPs. Nevertheless, we could safely state that the present study provides relevant preliminary information regarding neurotoxicity of green synthesized AgNPs."}

Addition of phenolic compounds decreased headspace oxygen consumption and hydroperoxide and p-anisidine values of emulsions, however, \u03b2-carotene or chlorophyll b tended to increase them. The results suggest that tocopherols at low concentration were the most important to reduce lipid oxidation of emulsions via radical scavenging, followed by high contents of polyphenols via radical scavenging and iron-chelation. Carotenoids and chlorophylls should be precisely controlled even in the dark, possibly due to their oxidation products."}

To date, despite promising in vitro properties, the cognitive and mood effects of the closely related Mentha spicata (spearmint) and Mentha piperita (peppermint) remain unexplored. This study therefore assessed the human cognitive/mood effects of the M. spicata/piperita essential oil with the most promising, brain-relevant in vitro properties according to pre-trial in vitro screening. Design: Organic spearmint and peppermint (Mentha spicata/piperita) essential oils were pre-screened for neurotransmitter receptor binding and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced cross-over study, 24 participants (mean age 25.2 years) consumed single doses of encapsulated placebo and 50 \u00b5l and 100 \u00b5l of the most promising essential oil (peppermint with nicotinic/GABAA receptor binding and AChE inhibitory properties, that increased calcium influx in a CAD cell neuronal model). Psychological functioning was assessed with mood scales and a range of standardised, cognitively demanding tasks pre-dose and at 1, 3 and 6 h post-dose. Results: The highest (100 \u00b5L) dose of essential oil improved performance on the cognitively demanding Rapid Visual Information Processing task (RVIP) at 1 h and 3 h post-dose and both doses attenuated fatigue and improved performance of the Serial 3 s subtraction task at 3 h post-dose. Conclusion: Peppermint (Mentha piperita) essential oil with high levels of menthol/menthone and characteristic in vitro cholinergic inhibitory, calcium regulatory and GABAA/nicotinic receptor binding properties, beneficially modulated performance on demanding cognitive tasks and attenuated the increase in mental fatigue associated with extended cognitive task performance in healthy adults.

Mentha piperita L. essential oil (MPEO) have been reported to possess protective effects against hepatotoxicity. However, its effect against liver fibrosis remains unknown. The present study investigated the antifibrogenic potential of MPEO and its underlying mechanisms. Forty male rats divided into 4 groups were used: group 1 served as normal control, group 2 (liver fibrosis) received CCl4 (2.5\u2009mL/kg, IP, twice weekly) for 8 weeks, group 3 concurrently received CCl4 plus MPEO (50\u2009mg/kg, IP, daily, from the 3rd week), and group 4 received MPEO only. MPOE significantly improved the liver injury markers, lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant capacity, CYP2E1 gene expressionand liver histology. Furthermore, MPOE ameliorated liver fibrosis as evidenced by the reduced expression of desmin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and SMAD3 proteins. In addition, MPOE counteracted the p53 upregulation induced by CCl4 at both mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, MPOE could effectively attenuate hepatic fibrosis mainly through improving the redox status, suppressing p53 and subsequently modulating TGF-\u03b21 and SMAD3 protein expression. These data promote the use of MPOE as a promising approach in antifibrotic therapy."}

However, much less effort has been dedicated to herbal plants. In this study, a robust monitoring for the levels of 94 primary and secondary metabolites and minerals in two medicinal herbs, basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and peppermint (Mentha piperita L.), grwon under both ambient (aCO2, 360\u202fppm) and eCO2 (620\u202fppm) was performed. We also assessed how the changes in herbal tissue chemistry affected their biological activity. Elevated CO2 significantly increased herbal biomass, improved the rates of photosynthesis and dark respiration, and altered the tissue chemistry. Principal Component Analysis of the full data set revealed that eCO2 induced a global change in the metabolomes of the two plants. Moreover, Hierarchical Clustering Analyses showed quantitative differences in the metabolic profiles of the two plants and in their responsiveness to eCO2. Out of 94 metabolites, 38 and 31 significantly increased in basil and peppermint, respectively, as affected by eCO2. Regardless of the plant species, the levels of non-structural carbohydrates, fumarate, glutamine, glutathione, ascorbate, phylloquinone (vitamin K1), anthocyanins and a majority of flavonoids and minerals were significantly improved by eCO2. However, some metabolites tended to show species specificity. Interestingly, eCO2 caused enhancement in antioxidant, antiprotozoal, anti-bacterial and anticancer (against urinary bladder carcinoma; T24P) activities in both plants, which was consequent with improvement in the levels of antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione, ascorbate and flavonoids. Therefore, this study suggests that the metabolic changes triggered by eCO2 in the target herbal plants improved their biological activities."}

Macrophages are essential in bacterial infection control due to their antimicrobial functions and ability to link the innate and adaptive immune responses. We evaluated the effects of the peppermint leaf hydroalcoholic extract (LHAE) on cultured murine peritoneal macrophages stimulated or not with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro. Vehicle-treated cells were used as controls. The constituents of the extract were also identified. Epicatechin was the major compound detected in the LHAE. LPS-induced macrophage death was reversed by incubation with LHAE (1-30\u2009\u03bcg/ml). Higher concentrations of the extract (\u2265100\u2009\u03bcg/ml) decreased macrophage viability (49-57%) in the absence of LPS. LHAE (1-300\u2009\u03bcg/ml) attenuated H2O2 (34.6-53.4%) but not nitric oxide production by these cells. At similar concentrations, the extract increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (15.3-63.5-fold) and glutathione peroxidase (34.4-73.6-fold) in LPS-treated macrophages. Only LPS-unstimulated macrophages presented enhanced phagocytosis (3.6-6.6-fold increase) when incubated with LHAE (3-30\u2009\u03bcg/ml). Overall, the LHAE obtained from peppermint modulates macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses, by stimulating the antioxidant pathway in these cells. These effects may be beneficial when the excessive activation of macrophages contributes to tissue damage during infectious disease."}

Mentha plants constitute one of the main valuable sources of essential oil used in foods and for medicinal purposes.The present study aimed to investigate the composition and in vitro antioxidant activity of Mentha piperita leaf essential oil (MpEO). A single dose of CCl4 was used to induce oxidative stress in rats, which was demonstrated by a significant rise of serum enzyme markers. MpEO was administrated for 7 consecutive days (5, 15, 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight) to Wistar rats prior to CCl4 treatment and the effects on serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and \u03b3 -glutamyl transpeptidase (\u03b3-GT) levels, as well as the liver and kidney superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) levels were evaluated. In addition, histopathological examinations of livers and kidneys was performed.The in vitro antioxidant activity of MpEO was lower than that of silymarin. Pretreatment of animals with MpEO at a dose of 5\u00a0mg/kg did not have a significant effect on ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, \u03b3GT, urea or creatinine levels in CCl4-induced stress. Whereas pretreatment with MpEO at doses of 15 and 40\u00a0mg/kg prior to CCl4, significantly reduced stress parameters (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH, \u03b3GT, urea and creatinine) compared to the CCl4-only group. Moreover, a significant reduction in hepatic and kidney lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and an increase in antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT and GPx was also observed after treatment with MpEO (40\u00a0mg/kg) compared to CCl4-treated rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with MpEO at 40\u00a0mg/kg can also markedly ameliorate the histopathological hepatic and kidney lesions induced by administration of CCl4.We could demonstrate with this study that MpEO protects liver and kidney from CCl4-induced oxidative stress and thus substantiate the beneficial effects attributed traditionally to this plant."}

The emulsions in tightly-sealed bottles were placed at 25\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark, and lipid oxidation and polyphenol contents and composition were determined. The lipid oxidation was high in the emulsions at pH 4.0 in the absence of iron, however, iron addition made them more stable than the emulsions at pH 2.6 or 6.0. Total polyphenols were remained at the lowest content during oxidation in the emulsions at pH 4.0, and iron reduced and decelerated polyphenol degradation. The results strongly suggest that polyphenols contributed to decreased lipid oxidation of the emulsion via radical scavenging and iron-chelation, and rosmarinic acid along with catechin, caffeic acid, and luteolin were key polyphenols as radical scavengers in the extract."}

The droplets of n-MPEO were < 200 nm and showed good stability for 4 months at 4 \u00b0C. The n-MPEO at 5.0 \u03bcL/mL displayed a more efficacious long-term antimicrobial activity than suspensions of MPEO (s-MPEO). Combined treatments of s-MPEO or n-MPEO and MHT, PEF, or HHP acted synergistically against E. coli. Nevertheless, combined treatments with n-MPEO showed the same or even higher efficacy than those with s-MPEO (up to 1- additional log10 reduction). Thus, by using nanoemulsions, lower doses of antimicrobial compounds (up to 4 times) or milder MHT (up to 4 \u00b0C), PEF (up to 5 kV/cm) and HHP (up to 100 MPa) treatments can be applied, while still guaranteeing the microbial safety of tropical fruit juices.The exploration of a series of different delivery systems of antimicrobial compounds in food products improves their antimicrobial efficacy and aids in the establishment of successful combined treatments for food preservation. The preparation of nanoemulsions of MPEO not only enhances the compound's stability, but also its antimicrobial efficacy (20% reduction in treatment time as compared with non-emulsified MPEO). Valuable synergistic effects that can be observed when combining n-MPEO with MHT, PEF, or HHP (up to 2.5- additional log10 reductions) reveal alternatives to traditional treatments that are successful because they help reduce treatment intensity, thereby helping to avoid adverse effects on juice quality without compromising food safety."}

Instrumental color, pH value, aw, oxidation\u2013reduction potential, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values and sensory analysis were determined after production. The results showed that the addition of M.\u2009piperita did not significantly affect (P\u2009<\u20090.05) on oxidative and sensory properties of cooked sausage. pH and aw in the sausages with mint and the control sample did not differ significantly (P\u2009<\u20090.05). This study confirms more effective operation of mint extracts to reduce lipid oxidation (which was observed by other researchers) than fresh mint, dried mint and mint brew to the production of cooked sausages. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Spices and herbs, which were originally added for improving taste, can also naturally and safely improve shelf life of food products. Mentha piperita is used in cooking, medicine and by the pharmaceutical industry. In the meat industry, the most commonly used are extracts and essential oils. The addition of mint (dried leaves, aqueous extract of dried leaves and fresh leaves) stabilized color and sensory properties of sausages, but did not affect the oxidative.

This study was carried out to determine the effect of brassinosteroid applications on the growth, development, biochemical properties and secondary metabolite accumulation in peppermint (Mentha piperita L.) plants grown at different levels of salt. For this aim, three different NaCl (0, 100 and 150mM) and four different brassinosteroid (0, 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5mgl\u22121) concentrations were applied to peppermint plants. As a result of the study it was demonstrated that all of the investigated parameters were affected by the applications of salt and brassinosteroid. Fresh and dry weights of aerial parts and dry leaf weight decreased in line with the elevating level of salinity. Insomuch as lots of plants died at 150mM NaCl. An increase in salinity led to reduction in essential oil content while lipid peroxidation, proline, antioxidant enzyme activities and total phenolic contents increased depending on rising of the salt concentrations. Brassinosteroid applications prevented the death of the plant even at 150mM NaCl and obstructed adverse effects resulting from salt by improving the antioxidant enzymes activities and decreasing the membrane permeability and lipid peroxidation. Also brassinosteroid significantly increased the essential oil content in salt conditions. Brassinosteroid contributed to the plant growth and development without showing toxic effects and 0.5mgl\u22121 of brassinosteroid significantly increased the essential oil content in nonstressed plants. It was determined that 0.5mgl\u22121 of brassinosteroid for 100mM NaCl and 2.5mgl\u22121 of brassinosteroid for 150mM NaCl were the most suitable concentrations in terms of injury degree, dry leaf weight, total phenolic contents and essential oil content in peppermint plants."}

We used a combination of phenotypic and genotypic techniques to analyze the community of fluorescent Pseudomonas strains in the rhizosphere of commercially grown Mentha piperita (peppermint). Biochemical techniques, Amplified rDNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA), and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the majority of the isolated native fluorescent strains were P. putida. Use of two Repetitive Sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) techniques, BOX-PCR and ERIC-PCR, allowed us to evaluate diversity among the native strains and to more effectively distinguish among them. PGPR activity was tested for the native strains and reference strain P. fluorescens WCS417r. Micropropagated M. piperita plantlets were exposed to microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) emitted by the bacterial strains, and plant biomass parameters and production of essential oils (EOs) were measured. mVOCs from 11 of the native strains caused an increase in shoot fresh weight. mVOCs from three native strains (SJ04, SJ25, SJ48) induced changes in M. pierita EO composition. The mVOCs caused a reduction of metabolites in the monoterpene pathway, for example menthofuran, and an increase in menthol production. Menthol production is the primary indicator of EO quality. The mVOCs produced by native strains SJ04, SJ25, SJ48, and strain WCS417r were analyzed. The obtained mVOC chromatographic profiles were unique for each of the three native strains analyzed, containing varying hydrocarbon, aromatic, and alogenic compounds. The differential effects of the strains were most likely due to the specific mixtures of mVOCs emitted by each strain, suggesting a synergistic effect occurs among the compounds present."}

MIC was determined by the broth dilution method. Synergy with fluconazole (FLC) was evaluated by checkerboard assay and FICI. Mid log phase cells harvested from YPD media were used for proton extrusion measurement and the rate of glucose-induced H(+) efflux gives PM-ATPase activity. Cell membrane integrity was estimated by total ergosterol content and scanning microscopy at respective MIC and sub-MIC values. In vitro hemolytic activity was performed to rule out possible cytotoxicity of the test compounds.The MIC value of mint EO, carvone, menthol, and menthone was 225, 248, 500, and 4200 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. At their respective MICs, these compounds showed 47, 42, 35, and 29% decrease in PM-ATPase activity besides showing synergy with FLC. In case of FLC-resistant strains, the decrease in H(+) efflux was by 52, 48, 32, and 30%, a trend similar to the susceptible cases. Exposed Candida cells showed a 100% decrease in the ergosterol content, cell membrane breakage, and alterations in morphology.Our studies suggest that mint EO and its lead compounds exert antifungal activity by reducing ergosterol levels, inhibiting PM-ATPase leading to intracellular acidification, and ultimately cell death.

OBJECTIVES: Our experiment aimed to comparatively investigate the effect of two essential oils (Mentha piperita and Saturenja hortensis) against cutaneous protothecosis experimentally induced by Prototheca zopfii in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunosuppressed BALB/c female mice, were divided into six experimental groups, infected with P.\u00a0zopfii, and then treated for 21 days against the infection. The effectiveness of the different treatments was assessed clinically and histologically by quantifying the degree of inflammation (immunohistochemical quantification of macrophages, T lymphocytes and neutrophils) and fibrosis. RESULTS: Skin lesions in experimental protothecosis from non-treated mice were more severe as compared to the four groups of treated animals. Both M.\u00a0piperita and S.\u00a0hortensis have proved to be efficient in vivo in the treatment of cutaneous protothecosis by reducing the clinical signs and significantly reducing the degree of inflammation (P<0.05 for the number of macrophages, T lymphocytes and neutrophils) and fibrosis as compared to untreated animals.

From these results, coatings containing chitosan and MPEO or MVEO are potential postharvest treatments to control common mold infections in table grape cv.

The result of molecular docking analysis attributed the QS inhibitory activity exhibited by PMO to menthol. Assessment of ability of menthol to interfere with QS systems of various Gram-negative pathogens comprising diverse AHL molecules revealed that it reduced the AHL dependent production of violacein, virulence factors, and biofilm formation indicating broad-spectrum anti-QS activity. Using two Escherichia coli biosensors, MG4/pKDT17 and pEAL08-2, we also confirmed that menthol inhibited both the las and pqs QS systems.

Mentha extract (ME) has antioxidant and antiperoxidant properties. This study was held to investigate the protective and anticancer effect of Mentha leaves aqueous extract on oral epithelium of mice tongues. DESIGN: A total of 80 Egyptian albino mice were divided into three groups. Group I served as control (not subjected to any kind of treatment), and groups II and III were subjected to two-stage chemical carcinogenesis through topical application of dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) followed by formaldehyde on dorsal and ventral surfaces of tongues for 9 weeks. Mentha leaves extract was administrated to group III at the same time of cancer induction. Histological changes were assessed in H&E sections at 3-week intervals. The anticarcinogenic effect of Mentha piperita was tested using immunostain with anticaspase antibody. RESULTS: The oral administration of ME reduced the appearance of dysplastic cellular changes with 61% and inhibited tumor incidence with 100%. Group I showed moderate-to-strong cytoplasmic caspase expression. At 6-week interval, group II showed weak-to-moderate caspase expression, while sections from group III showed moderate-to-strong caspase expression. High significant statistical difference in the total score of caspase 3 expression was found between specimens obtained from animals sacrificed at 6 weeks in groups I, II, and III (P = 0.001**). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that Mentha piperita has inhibited the initiation and promotion of oral dysplastic lesions."}

The effects of the coatings on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of cherry tomato fruits during storage were also assessed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CHI against all test fungi was 8 mg/mL, whereas the MIC for both MPEO and MVEO was 5 \u03bcL/mL. Combinations of CHI at 4 mg/mL and MPEO or MVEO at 2.5 or 1.25 \u03bcL/mL strongly inhibited the mycelial growth and spore germination of target fungi. The coatings comprising CHI and MPEO or CHI and MVEO at the different tested concentrations delayed the growth of decay-causing fungi in artificially contaminated tomato fruit during storage at either room temperature or low temperature. The assayed coatings preserved the quality of cherry tomato fruit during storage, in terms of physicochemical and sensory attributes. These results indicate that coatings comprising CHI and MPEO or CHI and MVEO represent promising postharvest treatments to prevent common postharvest mold infections in cherry tomato fruit during storage without affecting the quality of the fruit."}

Some plants adapt various morphological and biochemical alterations which are regulated transcriptionally to cope with the situation. A comparative study of waterlogging response in two different varieties of Mentha namely Mentha piperita and Mentha arvensis was performed. M. arvensis showed better response towards waterlogging in comparison to M. piperita. M. arvensis maintained a healthy posture by utilizing its carbohydrate content; also, it showed a flourished vegetative growth under waterlogged condition. Soluble protein, chlorophyll content, relative water content, and nitric oxide scavenging activity were comparatively more salient in M. arvensis during this hypoxia treatment. Lipid peroxidation was less in M. arvensis. M. arvensis also showed vigorous outgrowth of adventitious roots to assist waterlogging tolerance. To further investigate the possible gene transcripts involved in this response, we did cDNA subtraction of waterlogging treated M. piperita and M. arvensis seedlings. cDNA subtraction has identified thirty seven novel putative Expressed Sequence Tags which were further classified functionally. Functional classification revealed that maximum percentage of proteins belonged to hypothetical proteins followed by proteins involved in biosynthesis.

To compare the efficacy of Mentha piperita with simethicone in treatment for infantile colic. Methods. A double-blind crossover study was performed with 30 infants attending IMIP, Recife, Brazil. They were randomized to use Mentha piperita or simethicone in the treatment of infantile colic during 7 days with each drug. Primary outcomes were mother_s opinion about responses to the treatment, number of daily episodes of colic, and time spent crying, measured by a chronometer. Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests were used to compare the results. This study was previously approved by the Ethical Committee in Research at IMIP. Results. At baseline daily episodes of infantile colic was 3.9 (\u00b11.1) and the mean crying time per day was 192 minutes (\u00b151.6). At the end of the study daily episodes of colic fell to 1.6 (\u00b10.6) and the crying duration decreased to 111 (\u00b128) minutes. All mothers reported decrease of frequency and duration of the episodes of infantile colic and there were no differences between responses to Mentha piperita and simethicone. Conclusions.

The inhibitory effects of eight herbal extracts on the development of microbial biofilms was investigated against clinical and reference strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial activity was investigated on the planktonic forms using the minimum inhibitory concentration assay. The extracts that showed the highest antimicrobial activity against the two test organisms were Echinacea angustifolia (cone flower), Mentha piperita (peppermint) and Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) with minimum inhibitory concentration values between 0.38 and 2.5mg/ml. The crystal violet assay was used to assess the effect of pre-treating a surface with plant extracts on cell attachment and the extent of biofilm development following exposure to extracts (biofilm biomass). Most of the extracts reduced microbial colonization by at least 50%. In contrast, preformed biofilms were less responsive to the majority of extracts, thus growth inhibition was more difficult to achieve.

Cardiovascular diseases are becoming an increasing problem worldwide and hypercholesterolemia has been correlated for coronary heart diseases. Nearly all lipoproteins are involved in this process including cholesterol carried by very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), remnant lipoproteins and low density lipoproteins (LDL). Currently, available hypolipidemic drugs have been associated with the number of side effects. Herbal treatment for hyperlipidemia poses no side effects and is relatively cheap and locally available. In view of this, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of Menthe piperita on serum lipid levels of albino rats. Mentha piperita aqueous extract (100 mg/Kg, 250 mg/Kg p.o. daily) was fed for 3 weeks on fructose-fed rats and the levels of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, and atherogenic index was measured. Twenty-four male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups (6 per group). The results of present study indicate that Mentha piperita had significant beneficial effects against fructose-induced hyperlipidemia and showed good antioxidant activity.

The presence of 15 compounds (corresponding to 90.7% of the total chromatographic peak area) was confirmed by authentic standards. The EO presented a good activity against the following important postharvest deteriorating fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus ochraceous, Colletotrichum gloesporioides, Colletotrichum musae, Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium semitectum. At a concentration of 0.2% of the EO, all the fungi were completely inhibited, except for A.\u2003glaucus and C.\u2003musae which were inhibited 90 and 98%, respectively. TLC\u2010bioautography yielded three subfractions that prevented fungal growth, suggesting the presence of antifungals. Bioassay data of the crude EO were compared with those of the three subfractions. Based on these tests, it was concluded that several fungitoxics were responsible for the antifungal activity of M.\u2003piperita, with the principal ones being menthone, neomenthol, menthol and carvone. However, participation of other compounds cannot be ruled out. This is the first study in the literature that presents data on the activity of the crude EO against eight important postharvest deteriorating fungi, characterizing the amounts and types of comounds. In addition, also for the first time, the active fractions of the crude EO were isolated, identified and the components quantified. More detailed fungal tests are being conducted to confirm the tentative preliminary antifungal data. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Deterioration of agricultural products provoked by fungi accounts for considerable loss of crops of economic importance. Presently, these fungi are controlled by toxic synthetic chemicals. The food industry has significantly reduced the use of chemical preservatives. EOs have been known for their biological activities for many decades and they should, in principle, not be toxic to man and could replace toxic synthetic fungicides. This study demonstrates the potential of M.\u2003piperita EO as antifungal against C.\u2003gloeosporoides, C.\u2003musae, F.\u2003oxysporum, F.\u2003semitectum, A.\u2003niger, A. flavus and A.\u2003glaucus. Further studies are underway to evaluate M.\u2003piperita EO as a feed preservative. In addition, its principal active compounds were isolated and characterized. Identification of such components also helps to understand the mode of action of the extract, which can lead to the discovery of new antifungal compounds."}

Here, it was investigated the effect of Mentha piperita essential oil (peppermint oil) in rat tracheal rings along with its mechanism of action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tracheal tissue from male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were used. Peppermint oil was added in cumulative concentrations [1-300 microg/ml] to the tissue basal tonus or pre-contracted by carbachol [10 microM] at 10 min intervals, incubated or not with indomethacin [10 microM], L-N-metyl-nitro-arginine [100 microM], hexamethonium [500 microM], or tetraethylammonium [5 mM]. RESULTS: Peppermint oil [100 and 300 microg/ml] inhibited the contractions induced by carbachol, which was reversed by indomethacin, L-N-metyl-nitro-arginine and hexamethonium, but not by tetraethylammonium. These data suggest the participation of prostaglandin E(2), nitric oxide and autonomic ganglions in the peppermint oil relaxant effect and may be correlated with its popular use in respiratory diseases.

To determine yield and quality characters of two peppermint clones (Clone-3 and Clone-8), field experiments were carried out at four different locations (Ayd\u0131n, Bursa, Izmir and Tokat) in Turkey during 2007 and 2008. Locations with warmer climate gave higher fresh herbage yield (Ayd\u0131n and Izmir 37.0t/ha and 36.8t/ha, respectively). Although vigor canopy caused maximum fresh herbage yield, it decreased dried leaf yield due to the defoliation of leaves near to the ground. The main components menthol and menthone showed significant variation with different ecologies. Menthol contents were higher in temperate locations (Bursa and Tokat), while menthone contents were lower. The differences in oil composition of Clone-3 were lower than that of Clone-8 according to different climates, thus Clone-3 can be grown widely in various ecological conditions for oil productions as compared to the Clone-8. It was also concluded that temperate location was more suitable for peppermint oil production with high menthol contents."}

Aegypti). METHODS: The larvicidal potential of peppermint oil was evaluated against early fourth instar larvae of Ae. aegypti using WHO protocol. The mortality counts were made after 24 and 48 h, and LC50 and LC90 values were calculated. The efficacy of peppermint oil as mosquito repellent was assessed using the human-bait technique. The measured area of one arm of a human volunteer was applied with the oil and the other arm was applied with ethanol. The mosquito bites on both the arms were recorded for 3 min after every 15 min. The experiment continued for 3 h and the percent protection was calculated. RESULTS: The essential oil extracted from M. piperita possessed excellent larvicidal efficiency against dengue vector. The bioassays showed an LC50 and LC90 value of 111.9 and 295.18 ppm, respectively after 24 h of exposure. The toxicity of the oil increased 11.8% when the larvae were exposed to the oil for 48 h. The remarkable repellent properties of M. piperita essential oil were established against adults Ae. aegypti. The application of oil resulted in 100% protection till 150 min. After next 30 min, only 1-2 bites were recorded as compared with 8-9 bites on the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: The peppermint essential oil is proved to be efficient larvicide and repellent against dengue vector. Further studies are needed to identify the possible role of oil as adulticide, oviposition deterrent and ovicidal agent. The isolation of active ingredient from the oil could help in formulating strategies for mosquito control."}

Geranium (Pelargonium graveolens L. Herit ex Ait, family, Geraniaceae) is also vegetatively propagated (through rooted stem cutting), high value aromatic crop. Essential oil is extensively used in fragrance, aromatherapy, flavor, and pharmaceutical industries. A field experiment was conducted at CIMAP, Research Centre Farm, Bageshwar, Uttarakhand, India during 2006\u201308 (two cropping seasons), to increase the production potential, resource use efficiency and monetary advantages of peppermint intercropping with geranium in temperate climate. The intercropping systems evaluated under different plant density (75cm\u00d745cm, 90cm\u00d745cm and 120cm\u00d745cm) on biomass yield, essential oil content, yields and quality, resource use efficiency and monetary advantages of the intercropping system. Yield and quality attributes of peppermint was significantly influenced by plant density and intercrop. Under this intercropping system plant density 90cm\u00d745cm was found maximum yield advantages and resource utilization efficiency over 120cm\u00d745cm and 75cm\u00d745cm, while monocrop peppermint at plant density 75cm\u00d745cm was superior and produced 77.3% and 82.0% higher biomass and oil yield, respectively compared to wider spacing (120cm\u00d745cm). The land equivalent ratio (LER) area time equivalent ratio (ATER), land use efficiency (LUE %) and monetary retunes were higher in 90cm\u00d745cm spacing followed by 75cm\u00d745cm over monocrop. The quality of essential oils of both the crops was good and acceptable for market. This intercropping system will help to increase high value essential oil production and more benefit to peppermint/geranium growers and aroma industry in temperate region."}

Consumption of a number of plant-derived 'secondary metabolite' phytochemicals can modulate these psychological parameters, although there is a paucity of evidence collected in a sporting context. The structural groups into which these phytochemicals fall-phenolics, terpenes and alkaloids-vary in terms of the ecological roles they play for the plant, their toxicity and the extent to which they exert direct effects on brain function. The phenolics, including polyphenols, play protective roles in the plant, and represent a natural, benign component of the human diet. Increased consumption has been shown to improve cardiovascular function and is associated with long-term brain health. However, whilst short-term supplementation with polyphenols has been shown to consistently modulate cerebral blood-flow parameters, evidence of direct effects on cognitive function and alertness/arousal is currently comparatively weak. Terpenes play both attractant and deterrent roles in the plant, and typically occur less frequently in the diet. Single doses of volatile monoterpenes derived from edible herbs such as sage (Salvia officinalis/lavandulaefolia) and peppermint (Mentha piperita), diterpene-rich Ginkgo biloba extracts and triterpene-containing extracts from plants such as ginseng (Panax ginseng/quinquefolius) and Bacopa monnieri have all been shown to enhance relevant aspects of cognitive function and alertness. The alkaloids play toxic defensive roles in the plant, including via interference with herbivore brain function. Whilst most alkaloids are inappropriate in a sporting context due to toxicity and legal status, evidence suggests that single doses of nicotine and caffeine may be able to enhance relevant aspects of cognitive function and/or alertness. However, their benefits may be confounded by habituation and withdrawal effects in the longer term. The efficacy of volatile terpenes, triterpene-rich extracts and products combining low doses of caffeine with other phytochemicals deserves more research attention."}

Divergent evolution of homomeric prenyltransferases (PTSs) has allowed PTSs to optimize their active-site pockets to achieve catalytic fidelity and diversity. Little is known about heteromeric PTSs, particularly the mechanisms regulating formation of specific products. Here, we report the crystal structure of the (LSU . SSU)(2)-type (LSU/SSU = large/small subunit) heterotetrameric geranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GPPS) from mint (Mentha piperita). The LSU and SSU of mint GPPS are responsible for catalysis and regulation, respectively, and this SSU lacks the essential catalytic amino acid residues found in LSU and other PTSs. Whereas no activity was detected for individually expressed LSU or SSU, the intact (LSU . SSU)(2) tetramer produced not only C(10)-GPP at the beginning of the reaction but also C(20)-GGPP (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) at longer reaction times. The activity for synthesizing C(10)-GPP and C(20)-GGPP, but not C(15)-farnesyl pyrophosphate, reflects a conserved active-site structure of the LSU and the closely related mustard (Sinapis alba) homodimeric GGPPS. Furthermore, using a genetic complementation system, we showed that no C(20)-GGPP is produced by the mint GPPS in vivo. Presumably through protein-protein interactions, the SSU remodels the active-site cavity of LSU for synthesizing C(10)-GPP, the precursor of volatile C(10)-monoterpenes."}

METHOD: Three different levels of UV-B radiation were set in the experiment which included: natural light control (0 W x m(-2)), light UV-B radiation stress (0.15 W x m(-2)) and heavy UV-B radiation stress (0.35 W x m(-2)). The chloroplast ultrastructure, photosynthesis indexes and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of the M. piperita were observed under the three treatments. RESULT: Although the chloroplast ultrastructure was destroyed to some degree under the light UV-B radiation stress, F(v)/(F)m, F(v)/F(o), qP, phiPS II and ETR could resume to the comparative level of natural light control. At the same time, qN increased firstly and decreased thereafter. But under the high strength UV-B radiation stress, the photosynthetic structures were badly destroyed, which could not recover through protecting mechanism by itself. CONCLUSION: It was showed that M. piperita was able to protect photosynthetic structures by increasing respiration and dissipation when photosynthetic capacity reduced under light UV-B radiation stress. It is demonstrated that M. piperita has high adaptation to light UV-B radiation stress, which is kind of promising medical plant for area with higher UV-B radiation."}

Animals (Male Swiss albino mice) were given M. piperita leaf extract orally (1 g/kg body weight/day) for three consecutive days before radiation exposure (8 Gy gamma-radiation). Mice were autopsied at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days after irradiation to evaluate the radiomodulatory effect in terms of histological alterations, lipid peroxidation, and acid and alkaline phosphatases levels in testis. Radiation treatment showed reduction in the testis weight during all days of observation, however, in the M. piperita leaf extract-pretreated irradiated group there was a significant increase in testis weight. Radiation treatment induced moderate to severe testicular atrophy with degeneration of germ cells in seminiferous tubules. The tubules were shrunken and greatly depleted of germ cells. Sertoli cells with few germ cells were observed in the lumen. However, animals pre-treated with M. piperita leaf extract and exposed to radiation showed normal testicular morphology with regular arrangement of germ cells and slight degeneration of seminiferous epithelium. Significant decreases in the lipid peroxidation and acid phosphatase level and increase in level of alkaline phosphatase were observed in testis. The M. piperita leaf extract showed high amount of phenolic content, flavonoids content and flavonols. The results of the present study suggest that M. piperita has a significant radioprotective effect and the amount of phenolic compounds, the content of flavonoids and flavonols of M. piperita leaf extract may be held responsible for radioprotective effect due to their antioxidant and radical scavenging activity."}

Despite the maintenance of the main characteristics during the first 12 months of storage, the additional 6 months induced several significant changes in individual compounds. In general, the analyzed species reacted dissimilarly throughout time, but it was possible to verify that the fatty acids, tocopherols and antioxidant capacity presented the most significant changes after 18 months of storage, inclusively in samples submitted to gamma radiation. In fact, the applied treatment (10 kGy) did not seem to be effective to prevent the decrease of free sugars, organic acids and tocopherols, especially considering the 18 months period. On the other hand, the evolution in color parameters indicated a greener color (yet slightly more yellow) among irradiated samples. Likewise, gamma radiation had a positive effect on oleic acid, \u03b2-carotene bleaching inhibition (in infusions), DPPH scavenging activity and reducing power (in methanolic extracts).

The mycelial growth inhibition and ED50 were calculated. The chemical analysis of the EOs was analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. A total of 58 compounds were identified in the 12 EOs. All essential oils (EOs) analysed showed antifungal activity against the test pathogens in the range of 5\u00b732-100%. The inhibitory effect of oils showed dose-dependent activity on the tested fungus. Based on the ED50 values, clove, rose geranium, peppermint and patchouli were the most effective. This study warrants further research into the practical use of EOs for the control of important myco- and phytopathogens in intensive horticulture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:Due to the serious damage caused by fungal pathogens of vegetables and mushrooms, it is necessary to search for integrated strategies of disease control. This study provides relevant information about the effects of 12 essential oils (EOs) against eight pathogens of agricultural interest, included mycopathogens with emphasis on the possible future application of the EOs as alternative antifungal agents."}

The animals were divided into four groups. Group I: only vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was administered. Group II: the animals received Mentha leaf extract (1 g/kg body weight per day) orally for 30 days. Group III: animals were treated with sodium arsenite (4 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally in 0.9% NaCl. Group IV: animals were given Mentha extract for 10 consecutive days prior to sodium arsenite treatment and continuously for 30 days after sodium arsenite treatment. The animals from the above groups were killed at various time-points, and body weight and liver weight were measured. The biochemical estimation of lipid peroxidation (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in liver and serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) in serum were done. In the arsenic-treated group there was a significant increase in ACP, ALP, SGOT, SGPT and LPO content, whereas a significant decrease was recorded in body weight, liver weight, GSH and LDH activity in liver. Pre- and post-treatment of Mentha with arsenic significantly alters the biochemical parameters in liver. A significant decline in ACP, ALP, SGOT, SGPT and LPO content was observed. However, a significant increase in body weight, liver weight, GSH content and LDH activity in liver was estimated. The results indicate that the Mentha extract may be useful in reducing the side effects of arsenic-induced hepatopathy."}

The obtained results revealed that the emulsification and encapsulation efficiencies of peppermint EO were higher for all n-octenyl succinic anhydride (OSAN)-modified starches as compared to those of hydrolyzed starches (dextrins). The compositions of pure, emulsified, and encapsulated peppermint EOs in different matrices were quite similar; however, some changes in the percentages of some individual compounds were observed. Larger differences in the compositions of surface oils from various encapsulation products were obtained. Flavor components were released at different rates by each of the encapsulated products. The aroma binding capacity of different modified starch matrices to lock EO droplets depends on the water activity, and the leakage of aromas from encapsulated powder products during storage increased with increasing water activity."}

{"keyword": "Mentha piperita", "texts": "The variability of the enantiomeric distribution of biologically active chiral terpenes in Mentha piperita plants from different geographical origins was evaluated by solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS). The optimisation of some parameters (i.e. exposure temperature, extraction time and type of fibre) affecting SPME-extraction enabled relative standard deviations ranging from 4 to 13% to be achieved. The use of two different chiral stationary phases allowed to separate the identified chiral terpenes into their corresponding enantiomers as well as to verify the enantiomeric excesses of those compounds which were enantiomerically resolved on both phases. For all chiral terpenes, the enantiomeric composition varied within a very narrow range all over the samples. Consequently, it may be stated that the enantiomeric composition of chiral terpenes in Mentha piperita appears to be independent of the geographical origin of the plant and, thus, any alteration in the characteristic value may be related to an adulteration or inadequate sample handling. These results support the usefulness of the enantiomeric composition of bioactive chiral terpenes in Mentha piperita in authenticity studies."}

The oil is currently used in cosmetic formulations as a fragrance component, but previously had been also described as a denaturant. The extract and leaves are described as biological additives, but only the extract is reported to be used. Peppermint Water is described as a flavoring agent or fragrance component, but is not currently in use. Peppermint Oil is used at a concentration of < or = 3% in rinse-off formulations and < or = 0.2% in leave-on formulations. Peppermint Oil is composed primarily of menthol and menthone. Other possible constituents include pulegone, menthofuran, and limone. Most of the safety test data concern Peppermint Oil. The oil is considered to present the \"worst case scenario\" because of its many constituents, so data on the oil were considered relevant to the entire group of ingredients. Peppermint Oil was minimally toxic in acute oral studies. Short-term and sub-chronic oral studies reported cystlike lesions in the cerebellum in rats that were given doses of Peppermint Oil containing pulegone, pulegone alone, or large amounts (>200 mg/kg/day) of menthone. Pulegone is also a recognized hepatotoxin. Repeated intradermal dosing with Peppermint Oil produced moderate and severe reactions in rabbits, although Peppermint Oil did not appear to be phototoxic. Peppermint Oil was negative in the Ames test and a mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay but gave equivocal results in a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell chromosome aberration assay. In a carcinogenicity study of toothpaste and its components, no apparent differences were noted between mice treated with Peppermint Oil and those treated with the toothpaste base. Isolated clinical cases of irritation and/or sensitization to Peppermint Oil and/or its constituents have been reported, but Peppermint Oil (8%) was not a sensitizer when tested using a maximization protocol. It was expected that dermal absorption of Peppermint Oil would be rapid, following that of menthol, a major component, but in no case would be greater than absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the toxicity of pulegone, the safe concentration of this constituent was limited to < or = 1%. This concentration was achievable both by controlling the time of harvest and processing technique. There is evidence that menthol can enhance penetration of other agents. Formulators were cautioned that this enhanced penetration can affect the use of other ingredients whose safety assessment was based on their lack of absorption. With the limitation that the concentration of pulegone in these ingredients should not exceed 1%, it was concluded that Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaves, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Water are safe as used in cosmetic formulations."}

For this purpose, a total of 150 laying hens were randomly allocated to six experimental treatments with five replicates of five birds each. Dietary treatments consisted of three levels of a mixture of essential oils (0, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg) and two sources of lipid (soybean oil and fish oil containing different ratios of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids) fed to the animals during an 80-days feeding trial. Findings indicated that dietary administration of fish oil not only increased significantly the spleen relative weight (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and the antibody titre against Newcastle virus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but also led to reductions in liver relative weight (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and feed conversion ratio (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the mixture of herbal essential oils brought about declines in hepatic relative weight, heterophile to lymphocyte ratio (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and intestinal pathogen populations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animals were given either double distilled water or leaf extract of M. piperita orally (1 g/kg bwt/day) once a day for three consecutive days. Thirty min after the last treatment mice were exposed to 8 Gy of gamma radiation. Mice were autopsied at 30 min post-irradiation. Biochemical parameters were studied to assess the radioprotective effect of leaf extract of M. piperita. RESULTS: Animals pretreated with leaf extract of M. piperita and exposed to 8.0 Gy gamma radiation showed a significant increase in the activities of reduced glutathione content (p < 0.001), glutathione peroxidase (p < 0.005), glutathione reductase (p < 0.001), glutathione S-transferase (p < 0.005), superoxide dismutase (p < 0.005), and catalase (p < 0.005). Irradiated group pretreated with leaf extract of M. piperita showed significant decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) formation in liver. The leaf extract of M. piperita showed strong radical scavenging activity in both the 1, 1 diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl radical (DPPH*) and 2, 2 azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation (ABTS*+) assays.

The mice were killed at 9 weeks of age and tested for lung tumor incidence (chemoprevention); bone marrow micronucleus and chromosome aberration frequency (antigenotoxicity); and levels of liver and lung sulfhydral groups, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, and lipid peroxidation (LPO) (antioxidative properties). The ME treatment resulted in a significant reduction in the number of lung adenomas from an incidence of 67.92% in animals given only BP to 26.31%, an inhibition of 61.26%. Tumor multiplicity was 1.22 in the BP-alone group and 1.15 in the BP + ME group. In addition, compared with the animals in the BP-alone group, ME reduced the frequency of chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in bone marrow cells and decreased the levels of LPO and increased reduced glutathione content, and SOD and CAT activities in liver as well as lung.

Using a robotics-driven semirational design strategy, we identified a key KSI variant encoding four active site mutations, which confer a 4.3-fold increase in activity over the wild-type enzyme. This was assisted by the generation of crystal structures of four KSI variants, combined with molecular modeling of 3 binding to identify key active site residue targets. The KSI variant was demonstrated to function efficiently within cascade biocatalytic reactions with downstream Mentha enzymes pulegone reductase and (-)-menthone:(-)-menthol reductase to generate 1 from 3.

Interestingly a strong synergism was observed with oregano (Origanum vulgare) and pennyroyal mint (Mentha pulegium) essential oils, which were not so effective alone driven out to be important synergistic candidate. Our results demonstrated that essential oils of cinnamon and thyme can be used as potential antimicrobial agent against the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and Amoxicillin antibacterial activity can be enhanced using active constituents present in oregano and pennyroyal mint essential oils."}

Antibacterial nanorods of CQDs-ZnO had strong antibacterial activity under visible light irradiation, and a concentration of 0.1 mg/L was able to kill more than 96% of bacteria. The photocatalytic antibacterial mechanism was also studied. CQDs-ZnO produced more than three times the free radicals than pure ZnO under visible light irradiation. These free radicals destroyed the bacterial matrix of the cell wall and released cell proteins and nucleic acids. Moreover, CQDs-ZnO showed low cytotoxicity and can be used in medical applications."}

A general consensus about the substitutions that improve the activity remains elusive in stilbene class of molecules especially in regard to antibacterial activity. Lack of this knowledge remains a major hurdle in developing stilbene based antibacterial molecules. A panel of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were employed for screening the comparative efficacy of the stilbenes. In addition, the mechanisms that contribute to the antibacterial activity were investigated and correlated to structural changes. Employing the notorious nosocomial agent S. aureus we show how changes in structure alters not only the antibacterial activity but also the underlying mechanisms. Antibacterial activity by CLSI (Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines, oxidative stress and membrane damage by fluorescence based methods, DNA binding by spectroscopy, DNA cleavage by gel electrophoresis, substrate efflux by efflux mutant and cell wall damage by scanning electron microscopy were investigated. Antibacterial activity varied drastically among stilbenes bearing different functional groups. The best stilbenes in terms of activity also scored higher in one or more molecular events that contribute to cell death. Stilbenes superior to resveratrol in antibacterial acitvity were identified and probable causes for better activity were also identified. Our study revealed dimerization, halogenation and hydroxy group in conjunction with methoxy group resulted in the best antibacterial molecules.

{"keyword": "Antibacterial", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Quinoa is a food crop native to the Andes. The process of dehulling quinoa can produce approximately 8-12% husk, which is often discarded because it contains bitter saponin. Saponin derived from quinoa has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammatory and antifungal activity. However, the antibacterial effects of quinoa saponin against halitosis-related bacteria are still unclear. METHODS:In this study, quinoa saponin (QS) and alkali-transformed saponin (ATS) were separated by AB-2 resin to obtain QS-30, QS-80, ATS-30 and ATS-80. Halitosis-related bacteria included Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). The MIC and MBC were determined using gradient dilutions in 96-well plates, and the saponins were identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The changes in membrane integrity were tested using a microplate reader, the membrane potential was tested by spectrofluorometry, and the morphological characteristics were examined using a transmission electron microscope to explore the antibacterial mechanisms. RESULTS:Antibacterial assays indicated that QS-80 and ATS-80 showed inhibitory activity. In addition, ATS-80 exerted a stronger inhibitory effect than QS-80, especially against Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a lower minimum inhibitory concentration (31.3\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and a lower minimum bactericidal concentration (125\u2009\u03bcg/mL). ATS-80 destroyed the bacterial membrane structure, leading to bacterial death. CONCLUSIONS:Based on the excellent antibacterial activity and economic prospects of quinoa husk, ATS-80 could be used as an antibacterial agent to treat halitosis."}

{"keyword": "Antibacterial", "texts": "The emergence of bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics and the growing interest in developing alternative, natural antibacterial agents have prompted the search for plant-derived antibacterial peptides in recent decades. Different classes of endogenous antibacterial peptides have been identified from various plant species. Moreover, protein hydrolysates and hydrolysate-derived peptides with potent antibacterial effects have also been identified from numerous plant sources. Antibacterial peptides are often cationic and amphipathic, consisting of fewer than 100 amino acids. They are able to disrupt bacterial membrane integrity via pore formation and/or compromise bacterial metabolic processes. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the characteristics and modes of action of antibacterial peptides, as well as salient points concerning the production of antibacterial protein hydrolysates from plant proteins. Examples of plant-derived antibacterial hydrolysates and peptides will be highlighted, with particular attention to less explored seeds, fermented plant foods and agricultural by-products. Promising future research directions with regards to the application of plant-derived antibacterial hydrolysates and peptides in food preservation, farm animal disease management, and nutraceutical/functional food development will be proposed."}

The spinning of segmented-pie bi-component fibers was conducted using compositions of polyethylene and nylon 6 with 1.0% of TiO\u2082 as photocatalytic particulate filler. A lab-scale double-extrusion fiber spinning system was used to spin the filament fibers with differing winding speeds of 300 m/min, 500 m/m, and 700 m/m. The extruded round fibers were split into minuscule pie-shaped filaments, which significantly increased their photocatalytic surface areas. The compositions and morphologies of the split filaments and the TiO\u2082 particles in the filaments were characterized by optical microscopic images. Scanning electron microscopic images were used to investigate particles secured on the filament surfaces. The antibacterial effects of the fibers were assessed using a modified method based on the standard method, AATCC100: Assessment of Antibacterial Finishes on Textile Materials, by adding a visible light source above the test samples. The filament samples were tested with the two test organisms of Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The numbers of bacteria present were determined, and the percent reduction for the specimens with fibers embedded with TiO\u2082 and that with fibers without TiO\u2082 were calculated. The segmented-pie bi-component fiber with 1.0% TiO\u2082 showed enhanced bioactivity against both species of tested bacteria."}

Materials and Methods:Powder formulations of CHX (2.5%) and CT (2.5%) were added to the powder of Biodentine and served as experimental groups (EXP). Antibacterial free groups were designed as control (CNT). The antibacterial acitivity (AB) (n = 5; for each) of disc-shaped specimens against Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillius casei and compressive strength (CS) (n = 10; for each) tests used both for groups after 24 h after polymerization. Statistical Analysis Used:Normality of data were tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Significant differences were analyzed with the Mann-Whintey U test for both the methods (agar disk diffusion and compressive strength) at a significance level of P < 0.05. Results:Significantly higher antibacterial effects were obtained in EXP groups compared to the CNTs for both bacteria after 24 h, distinctly (P < 0.01). No differences were found between groups regarding the CS values (P > 0.05). Conclusion:Since the incorporation of 5% CHX/CT to the Biodentine exhibited acceptable antibacterial activity without hampering compressive strength values at 24 h, this combination could be a promising alternative for eliminating the residual bacteria for indirect pulp-capping therapies."}

We examined the antibacterial properties of coatings assembled from poly-l-lysine (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (HA). PLL/HA films were fabricated using layer-by-layer assembly with three different PLL MWs, differentiated by number of repeat units, that is, 33, 91, and 407 (denoted by PLL30 , PLL90 , and PLL400 ). Films assembled with all three PLL MWs completely inhibited the growth of planktonic, gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus and gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli over a 24-h exposure. All three film architectures also inhibited S. aureus attachment by ~60-70% compared to non-film-coated surfaces, likely attributed to significant film hydration and electrostatic repulsion due to HA. The true differences in antibacterial efficacy between different PLL MWs were observed upon repeated exposure of PLL/HA to S. aureus every 24\u2009h. We found that PLL400 films lost the ability to inhibit planktonic S. aureus growth after one use while PLL30 and PLL90 films were effective over 4-5 and 9-13 repeated exposures, respectively. Our experiments indicated that differences in efficacy were related to low in-film mobility of PLL400 and also agreed with dissolution timescales for PLL30 and PLL90 films. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Therefore, investigation of new bioactive compounds from natural sources has been taken into account. This study was designed to purify and characterize the bioactive compound in the cell free supernatant (CFSs) of autochthonous gut bacteria (Bacillus methylotrophicus NR116240, B. amyloliquefaciens NR117946, Pseudomonas fluorescens NR113647 and B. licheniformis NR118996) isolated from rohu, Labeo rohita. CFSs were antagonistic to fish pathogenic Aeromonas spp., moderately thermo-tolerant and active in wide range of pH (5-11). Antibacterial activity of the CFSs was reduced by the action of proteases (e.g., Proteinase K and Trypsin), indicating proteinaceous nature of the bioactive compound like the bacteriocins. Three-step purification procedure resulted in recovery of 16.97%, 18.04%, 33.33% and 6.38% activity of the antimicrobial protein produced by B. methylotrophicus, B. amyloliquefaciens, P. fluorescens and B. licheniformis, respectively. Purification at each step revealed decrease in protein content with gradual increase in the specific activity of the antimicrobial protein. The purified antibacterial compound ranged between 18.2 and 25.6\u202fkDa. Identification through MALDI-TOF MS/MS and database search through Mascot search engine predicted that the bactericidal compound belonged to either alkaline proteases, or, transcriptional regulator and some hypothetical proteins. Apart from potential technological application of the antibacterial compound, the present study might show promise for application of gut-associated bacteriocinogenic bacteria to control diseases in fish caused by pathogenic bacteria."}

Our study population was 2,152 HIV-exposed, uninfected infants enrolled in the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals and Nutrition study in Lilongwe, Malawi, during 2004-2010. All infants were breastfed through 28 weeks of age. Antibacterial drugs were prescribed frequently (to 80% of infants), and most (67%) of the 5,329 prescriptions were for respiratory indications. Most commonly prescribed were penicillins (43%) and sulfonamides (23%).

In this context, zinc phthalocyanine-colistin (ZnPc-Col) conjugate as a new photosensitizer was synthesized in the hope of improving interaction of phthalocyanine with the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. Overcoming the low solubility of phthalocyanine, was achieved by the incorporation of ZnPc-Col into chitosan hydrogel. The weight percentages of ZnPc-Col and glutaraldehyde had remarkable effects in determining the hydrogel microstructure. Different spectroscopic methods, SEM, and rheological measurements were used to assess the properties of ZnPc-Col and prepared hydrogels. The photosensitizing activity of the hydrogels was investigated by application of 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran as a singlet oxygen chemical quencher. Hydrogels bearing zinc phthalocyanine-colistin adduct revealed an improved APDT efficiency compared to hydrogels containing just zinc phthalocyanine component.

In recent years, antibacterial coatings that are responsive to the bacterial microenvironment, that possess two or more killing mechanisms, or that have triggered-cleaning capability have emerged as promising solutions for bacterial infection and contamination problems. This review focuses on recent progress on three types of such responsive and synergistic antibacterial coatings, including i) self-defensive antibacterial coatings, which can \"turn on\" biocidal activity in response to a bacteria-containing microenvironment; ii) synergistic antibacterial coatings, which possess two or more killing mechanisms that interact synergistically to reinforce each other; and iii) smart \"kill-and-release\" antibacterial coatings, which can switch functionality between bacteria killing and bacteria releasing under a proper stimulus. The design principles and potential applications of these coatings are discussed and a brief perspective on remaining challenges and future research directions is presented."}

The search for methods enabling the limitation of the bacterial factor has become the fundamental goal of the dental materials research. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are used as disinfection agents. An incomplete polymerization of the polymer resins combined with AgNPs, along with the increase of the release of the unbound monomers, have been found. OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate the vitality of the human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in response to a disinfection agent containing silver and gold nanoparticles (NPs), different bonding systems, glass-ionomer cement (GIC), and their combinations with the disinfection agent. Also, the influence of these materials both on the secretory function of DPSCs and on their antibacterial properties was established. MATERIAL AND METHODS:Cytotoxicity (MTT assay) and genotoxicity (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay - ELISA) assays were used in the study. Antibacterial features were assessed with the optical density (OD) measurement of the bacteria (Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius and Lactobacillus acidophilus) kept in dental materials. RESULTS:The disinfection liquid proved to be biocompatible. However, it relevantly interfered with the total-etch bonding system in terms of vitality, which may have serious clinical implications. Its combination with the self-etching system was biocompatible, yet it impaired the antibacterial action of the system. An enhancement of antibacterial action of GIC with AgNPs was found. CONCLUSIONS:The disinfection liquid and GIC were biocompatible toward the DPSCs in terms of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Simultaneous usage of AgNPs with other dental materials did not affect the biocompatibility of the used materials. The disinfection liquid and GIC acted as antibacterial agents against all studied bacteria species. Used together with GIC and the total-etch bonding system, the disinfection liquid seemed to be efficient toward bacteria, yet it relevantly impaired the antibacterial action of self-etching systems."}

However, these materials have no antibacterial properties. To obtain an antibacterial active surface, a nanostructure of Ti6Al4V alloy was created. This specific nanostructure contained nanotubes and micro-cavities and was used as a substrate for silver anchoring. The electrochemical approach to silver reduction was studied. It is a common approach for silver deposition and in this work, inhomogeneities in the nanostructure were used as a preferential area for silver localisation. The galvanostatic regimen of deposition allowed for a technically quantitative process and the required silver placement. The experimental conditions used enabled testing and silver dissolution rate evaluation within a reasonable time span. Based on the corrosion and analytical results (EDS, XPS and ICP-MS), a two-phase silver release mechanism was confirmed. The openings of the individual nanotubes were filled with silver nanoparticles, whose release was relatively fast. By contrast, the silver anchored inside the cavities allowed the silver to release gradually. Antibacterial efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was successfully demonstrated. Cytotoxicity testing with murine fibroblasts showed cell metabolic activity far above the normative limit of 70%."}

CONCLUSIONS:Due to their antimicrobial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties, the extracts of these plants might be used as natural sources in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries."}

In microbial drug discovery, Streptomyces are well known source of two-thirds of natural antibiotics used clinically. Hence, screening of new strains of streptomycetes is the key step to get novel bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity against drug resistant bacteria. RESULTS:In the present study, Streptomyces antibioticus strain M7, possessing potent antibacterial activity against different pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from rhizospheric soil of Stevia rebudiana. 16S rRNA sequence of M7 (1418\u2009bp) showed 96.47-100% similarity with different Streptomyces spp. and the maximum similarity (100%) was observed with Streptomyces antibioticus NBRC 12838T (AB184184). Phylogenetic analysis using neighbor joining method further validated its similarity with Streptomyces antibioticus NBRC 12838\u2009T (AB184184) as it formed clade with the latter and showed high boot strap value (99%). Antibacterial metabolites isolated from the fermentation broth were characterized using NMR, FT-IR and LC-MS as actinomycins V, X2 and D. The purified actinomycins exhibited potent antibacterial activities against test bacteria viz. B. subtilis, K. pneumoniae sub sp. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. typhi, E. coli, MRSA and VRE. Among these actinomycins, actinomycin X2 was more effective as compared to actinomycins D and V. The minimum inhibitory concentration values of purified compounds against a set of test bacterial organisms viz. VRE, MRSA, E. coli (S1-LF), K. pneumoniae sub sp. pneumoniae and B. subtilis ranged between 1.95 and 31.25\u2009\u03bcg/ml. CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrates that actinomycins V, X2 and D produced by S. antibioticus strain M7 hold the potential to be used against multidrug resistant bacteria, particularly VRE and MRSA."}

Morphological tuning using different solvents resulted in the formation of different shapes, such as disc, spindle, rod and sphere (abbreviated as FZ-ND, FZ-NSP, FZ-NR and FZ-NS, respectively). Structural, morphological and compositional characterization of these nanoparticles (NPs) has been carried out. Antibacterial efficacy of the synthesized NPs was checked against Gram negative V. cholerae N16961 (VcN16961) and Gram positive S. aureus bacteria by recording optical density (OD) at different time points. Among the NPs tested, FZ-NSP was found to be the most effective against VcN16961, while FZ-NR showed maximum efficacy against S. aureus, implying the importance of nanotextured surface as well as the morphology in the manifestation of antibacterial activity. The kinetics of growth for both the bacteria has been modelled using logistic approach. Cytotoxicity was evaluated through MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7), human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2) and against normal human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK-293). The lesser toxicity of \u03b1-Fe2O3-ZnO towards HEK-293 and the potent anticancer activity against MCF-7 and HepG2 cells underline its applicability as anticancer agent. With continued improvement of nanotechnology, this study may pave the way for designing and construction of various morphologically diverse, nanotextured materials with desired functional attributes."}

Wood samples of Melia azedarach were treated with water extract, and the antifungal activity was examined at concentrations of 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% against three mold fungi; Fusarium culmorum MH352452, Rhizoctonia solani MH352450, and Penicillium chrysogenum MH352451 that cause root rot, cankers, and green fruit rot, respectively, isolated from infected Citrus sinensis L. Antibacterial evaluation of the extract was assayed against four phytopathogenic bacteria, including Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia amylovora, and Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, using the micro-dilution method to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Further, the antioxidant capacity of the water extract was measured via 2,2'-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Phenolic and flavonoid compounds in the water extract were analyzed using HPLC: benzoic acid, caffeine, and o-coumaric acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds; while the flavonoid compounds naringenin, quercetin, and kaempferol were identified compared with the standard flavonoid compounds. The antioxidant activity of the water extract in terms of IC50 was considered weak (463.71 \u03bcg/mL) compared to the standard used, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (6.26 \u03bcg/mL). The MIC values were 200, 300, 300, and 100 \u00b5g/mL against the growth of A. tumefaciens, E. cloacae, E. amylovora, and P. carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, respectively, which were lower than the positive control used (Tobramycin 10 \u03bcg/disc). By increasing the extract concentration, the percentage inhibition of fungal mycelial was significantly increased compared to the control treatment, especially against P. chrysogenum, suggesting that the use of A. saligna flower extract as an environmentally friendly wood bio-preservative inhibited the growth of molds that cause discoloration of wood and wood products."}

Inorganic materials are attractive due to their high stability under a variety of conditions compared to organic antibacterial agents. Herein tungsten oxide nanodots (WO3-X), synthesized by a simple one-pot synthetic approach, was found to exhibit efficient antibacterial capabilities. The analyses with colony-forming units (CFU) showed excellent antibacterial activity of WO3-X against both gram-negative E. coli (Escherichia coli) and gram-positive S. aureus (Staphylococcus aureus) strains. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images revealed clear damage to the bacterial cell membranes, which was further confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, exposure to simulated sunlight was found to further increase germicidal activity of WO3-X nanodots -- a 30-minute exposure to sunlight (combining 50 \u00b5g/mL WO3-X nanodots) showed a 70% decrease in E. coli viability compared to without exposure. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) was used to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this photocatalytic activity through the generation of hydroxyl radical species. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and the live/dead assay were further employed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of WO3-X nanodots on eukaryotic cells, which demonstrated their general biocompatibility.

Methods:The antibacterial effectiveness of conventional AD clothes was compared across each other by (i) standard suspension tests for the appraisal of antibacterial products and (ii) a real-life setup of affected AD skin using S. aureus colonised artificial skin, to assess if functional clothes are effective under practical wear conditions. Additionally, the interaction of the fibre types with a moisturising cream was evaluated during a real wearing situation and after domestic laundry. Results:In the real-life setup simulating dry skin microenvironment, all samples failed to reduce S. aureus. Silver and zinc-fabrics showed a slight activity only under unrealistic moist conditions. When using standard suspension tests, samples differed considerably in their antibacterial effectiveness, where silver and zinc endowed fibres outperformed AEGIS endowed silk fabrics. Garments absorbed the cream dependent on the particular fibre types. Furthermore, domestic laundry was unable to completely remove the cream. Conclusion:Considerable differences in the antibacterial effectiveness of conventional AD clothes were revealed. Under practical (dry) wear conditions, garments were unable to modify skin colonization with S. aureus, although effectiveness can be triggered by wetting the garments.

The aim of this study is to design a more clinically powerful anti-caries treatment by combining amelogenin-derived peptide QP5 with antibacterial chitosan in a hydrogel (CS-QP5 hydrogel), and characterize its effects on inhibition of cariogenic bacteria and promotion of remineralization of initial caries lesions. DESIGN:CS-QP5 interactions at different pH and chitosan concentrations were studied using UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism. Antibacterial activity was measured using broth microdilution and biofilm assays. Remineralizing activity was measured using tests of surface micro-hardness(SMH), polarized light microscopy(PLM) and transverse microradiography(TMR) in a pH cycling model that simulates intra-oral pH conditions. RESULTS:The results of UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism analyses suggest that the micro-environment of QP5 changes upon addition of chitosan and the interaction between QP5 and chitosan is reversible and dependent on pH. CS-QP5 hydrogel showed good antibacterial potency towards Streptococcus mutans with MIC/MBC of 5\u2009mg/mL, reducing adhesion and biofilm formation up to 95.43% and nearly 100% respectively. According to the results of remineralizing studies, CS-QP5 hydrogel demonstrated 50.06% surface micro-hardness recovery, shallower lesion depth, significantly less mineral loss and more mineral content at different depth in the lesion body after pH cycling. CONCLUSIONS:The hydrogel showed promise as a dual-action caries control agent in vitro, whether it could present good effects in vivo still needs to be determined, which requires further study. Nonetheless, the new design of bioactive hydrogel with antibacterial and remineralizing properties has the potential to substantially benefit oral health."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "The role of parasitic sea lice (Siphonostomatoida; Caligidae), especially Lepeophtheirus salmonis, in the epidemiology of Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus (ISAv) has long been suspected. The epidemiological studies conducted during the 1998 major Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA) outbreak in Scotland demonstrated a strong correlation between sea lice presence and ISAv positive sites or subsequent clinical outbreaks of ISA. The question posed from this observation was \"do sea lice infestations on Atlantic salmon make them more susceptible to viral infections?\" This study investigated the role that sea lice infestations have on the severity of ISAv infections and disease mortality in experimental populations of farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). A series of experiments was carried out that investigated the potential of sea lice to modify the outcome of an ISAv infection. Experimental populations of Atlantic salmon were established that had: no lice and no ISAv, a single infection with either ISAv or lice and a co-infection with lice then ISAV. The results were quite clear, the process of infestation by the parasite prior to ISAv exposure significantly increased the mortality and death rates of Atlantic salmon, when compared to uninfected controls and ISAv infected groups only. This was consistent over two source strains of Atlantic salmon (Pennobscot and Saint John River), but the severity and timing was altered. Immunological responses were also consistent in that pro-inflammatory genes were induced in lice only and co-infected fish, whereas the anti-viral response, Mx, MH class I \u03b2, Galectin 9 and TRIM 16, 25 genes were down-regulated by lice infection prior to and shortly after co-infection with ISAv. It is concluded that the sea lice settlement on Atlantic salmon and the parasite's subsequent manipulation of the host's immune system, which increases parasite settlement success, also increased susceptibility to ISAv."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) are ectoparasitic copepods which have a large negative economic and welfare impact in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, particularly in Chile. A multi-faceted prevention and control strategy is required to tackle lice, and selective breeding contributes via cumulative improvement of host resistance to the parasite. While host resistance has been shown to be heritable, little is yet known about the individual loci that contribute to this resistance, the potential underlying genes, and their mechanisms of action. In this study we took a multifaceted approach to identify and characterize quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting host resistance in a population of 2,688 Caligus-challenged Atlantic salmon post-smolts from a commercial breeding program. We used low and medium density genotyping with imputation to collect genome-wide SNP marker data for all animals. Moderate heritability estimates of 0.28 and 0.24 were obtained for lice density (as a measure of host resistance) and growth during infestation, respectively. Three QTL explaining between 7 and 13% of the genetic variation in resistance to sea lice (as represented by the traits of lice density) were detected on chromosomes 3, 18, and 21. Characterisation of these QTL regions was undertaken using RNA sequencing and pooled whole genome sequencing data. This resulted in the identification of a shortlist of potential underlying causative genes, and candidate functional mutations for further study. For example, candidates within the chromosome 3 QTL include a putative premature stop mutation in TOB1 (an anti-proliferative transcription factor involved in T cell regulation) and an uncharacterized protein which showed significant differential allelic expression (implying the existence of a cis-acting regulatory mutation). While host resistance to sea lice is polygenic in nature, the results of this study highlight significant QTL regions together explaining between 7 and 13 % of the heritability of the trait. Future investigation of these QTL may enable improved knowledge of the functional mechanisms of host resistance to sea lice, and incorporation of functional variants to improve genomic selection accuracy."}

The molecular receptors that parasites employ to detect host-specific chemical stimuli from hosts (kairomones) have not been well characterised. In the present study, transcription of the sea louse Ionotropic receptor 25a (IR25a) was blocked to evaluate whether it functions as a chemical-perception related gene for a specific chemical cue from the Atlantic salmon host. Double-strand RNA interference (dsRNA) oligonucleotides were applied to salmon lice by in vitro transcription and then exposing salmon lice nauplii to dsRNA by soaking overnight. Silencing of the IR25a gene was confirmed by qPCR in experimental groups of knock-down copepodids (dsIR25a). Behavioural responses associated with host recognition were evaluated in dsIR25a sea lice after exposure to a peptide produced by the salmon host (Cath-2). The dsIR25a group decreased expression levels of IR25a by >7-fold with respect to the control group. This group was also 26% slower than the control group (control swimming speed was 69\u202fmm/s, while the treated group was 51\u202fmm/s). Since the swimming activity of salmon lice copepodids is associated with the activation of the chemosensory system, these results indicate that the L. salmonis chemosensory perception system was not fully activated due to gene silencing. The results of this study demonstrate the role of ionotropic receptor 25a during host recognition by sea lice."}

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of head lice infestation among female primary school children in selected districts of Mazandaran Province, Iran. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 3033 female school children were recruited using the consensus method. Head lice infestation was defined as visible adult lice, nymph or egg with the naked eye. Data were described by percent frequency and analyzed using the chi-squared test and multivariate logistic regression models. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results Prevalence of head lice infestation among female school children was estimated at 7.9%. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) [95% confidence intervals (CI)] for rural residents, low level educated mothers, family size more than five and not combing their hair were 1.96 (1.41-2.78), 2.46 (1.35-4.49), 2.04 (1.12-3.70) and 3.94 (1.73-8.96), respectively. In addition, considering first grade students as a reference group, the ORs (95% CI) for second and third grades were 1.89 (1.18-3.05) and 1.69 (1.05-2.74), respectively. Conclusion Our study showed that studying in urban schools, low educational level of mothers, grade, family size and no history of regular combing were predictors of head lice infestation."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Parasite dispersal can shape host-parasite interactions at both deep and shallow timescales. One approach to understanding the effects of dispersal is to study parasite lineages that differ in dispersal capability but are from the same group of hosts. In this study, we compared phylogenetic and population genetic patterns of wing and body lice from ground-doves. Wing lice are more capable of dispersal than body lice. We sequenced full genomes of individual lice for multiple representatives of several wing and body louse species. From these data, we assembled genes for phylogenetic analysis and called SNPs for population genetic analysis. At the phylogenetic level, body lice showed more codivergence with their hosts than did wing lice. However, both wing and body lice exhibited some phylogenetic congruence with their hosts. Within species, body lice showed more population genetic structure than wing lice, although both types of lice showed some structure according to biogeography. Body lice also had significantly lower heterozygosity than wing lice, suggesting more inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that dispersal can shape a host-parasite system across evolutionary time, but also that other factors (e.g., host association and biogeography) can have varying degrees of influence on different groups of parasites and at different evolutionary scales."}

At the scale of hosts, lice were most abundant on prairie dogs in poor body condition (with low mass:foot ratios) and prairie dogs harboring large numbers of fleas (Siphonaptera, mostly Oropsylla hirsuta (Baker, Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae) and Pulex simulans (Baker,Siphonaptera: Pulicidae)). Lice have been implicated as supplemental vectors of the primarily flea-borne bacterium Yersinia pestis (Yersin, Enterobacteriales: Yersiniaceae), a re-emerging pathogen that causes sylvatic plague in prairie dog populations.

The study of head lice from a deceased victim of neglect helped unravel time-length since death, frequency of exposure to neglect and the cause and circumstances related to the death. Nit-clusters are markers of neglect, indicating length and frequency of neglect episodes. In the case study used here that culminated in the death of the victim, sustained abandonment started circa 2 years before discovery. The lice suggested that death was caused by overconsumption of a powerful calcium channel blocker, an antihypertensive, an excess of which in lice food supply (blood) stops oogenesis. Despite hosting thousands of adult females on the hair, lice reproduction stopped and nits were no longer developed or deposited on the hairs at the root end. This short distance of the shaft with no nits provided a time estimation of overdosing of almost 2 months before death."}

It is fundamental to understand susceptibility to L. salmonis within wild and farmed populations, to manage possible wild-farmed interactions. Two distinct wild salmon populations from rivers adjacent to aquaculture operations (Garnish and Conne River, Newfoundland, Canada) and one farmed population were challenged with L. salmonis. Skin samples of non-infested, low-infested (\u2264 7 lice) and high-infested salmon (\u226517 lice) from each population were analyzed by qPCR for the expression of 20 immune-relevant genes.

The wild populations showed a different basal skin transcript profile for CAMP2, IL8 (down-regulated), IgT, GAPDH, iNOS, and CD8a (up-regulated) compared to the farmed population.

The relationship between salmon farming and sea lice is made up of various components: the parasite, host, environment and farming practices, which make it difficult to identify patterns in parasite population dynamics to define prevention and control strategies. The objectives of this study were to analyse and compare the effect of farming, sanitary practices and environmental variables on the abundance of gravid females (GF) and juveniles (JUV) of C.\u00a0rogercresseyi on Salmo salar in three Salmon Neighborhood Areas (SNAs) in Region 10, south of Chile. Linear mixed-effects models of the negative binomial distribution were used to evaluate the effect of the different explanatory variables on GF and JUV. Productive variables were the key drivers explaining the abundance of GF and JUV. Results suggest that C.\u00a0rogercresseyi is not controlled and JUV are persistent in the three SNAs, and sanitary practices do not control the dissemination of the parasite among sites. Environmental variables had a low impact on sea lice abundance.

A specific scientific debate has been whether the statistical association between infestation pressure (IP) from fish farms and the number of parasites observed on wild sea trout emerges purely because of a confounding and direct effect of temperature (T). METHODS:We studied the associations between louse infestation on wild sea trout, fish farm activity and temperature in an area that practices coordinated fallowing in Nordhordland, Norway. The data were sampled between 2009 and 2016. We used negative binomial models and mediation analysis to determine to what degree the effect of T is mediated through the IP from fish farms. RESULTS:The number of attached lice on sea trout increased with the T when the IP from fish farms was high but not when the IP was low. In addition, nearly all of the effect of rising T was indirect and mediated through the IP. Attached lice remained low when neighbouring farms were in the first year of the production cycle but rose substantially during the second year. In contrast to attached lice, mobile lice were generally seen in higher numbers at lower water temperatures. Temperature had an indirect positive effect on mobile louse counts by increasing the IP which, in turn, raised the sea trout louse counts. Mobile louse counts rose steadily during the year when neighbouring farms were in the first year of the production cycle and stayed high throughout the second year. CONCLUSIONS:The estimates of the IP effect on louse counts along with the clear biennial pattern emerging due to the production cycle of fish farms clearly indicate that fish farms play an important role in the epidemiology of sea lice on wild sea trout. Furthermore, the mediation analysis demonstrates that a large proportion of the effect of T on louse counts is mediated through IP."}

This study aimed to understand the impact of Pediculus humanus capitis infestations in the lives of Honduran children living in extreme poverty. METHODS:A qualitative study on head lice infestation was conducted in June 2016 in a rural community in Honduras. Parents were invited to bring their children for head lice inspection using a dry-combing technique with a stainless steel-toothed comb with suction power. A semistructured questionnaire was administered to participants. Questions were broadly grouped into knowledge about transmission, control practices, barriers to treatment, and the overall impact of these infestations in children's wellbeing. Responses were coded, categorized, and organized through a theme-based approach. RESULTS:In total, 52 children aged 2-14\u00a0years (42 girls) and their mothers were enrolled in the study. The overall proportion of children with an infestation was 83%. Response analysis revealed a lack of understanding regarding lice transmission and stigmatization of infested children and the widespread belief that head lice were acquired during bathing in the slow-flowing river running through the village. An agricultural plaguicide was commonly used to rid children of head lice. CONCLUSIONS:The study underscores the dire situation of the rural poor, their physical and mental health affected by pediculosis capitis as well as other NTDs. These results highlight the need to reassess approaches and action towards combating NTDS under an integrated framework."}

Over the centuries, man has developed a variety of remedies, all of which have ultimately culminated in the use of chemical agents. Some of these remedies are known to produce successful results. A large portion of the effective remedies used to kill lice and their eggs contain insecticides, but there is an increasing number of reports of head lice populations revealing an increased resistance. This study presents an alternative treatment approach, the efficacy of which is based on physical effects. Cold atmospheric pressure plasmas have successfully shown their formidably wide application range within the field of plasma medicine. This study presents a plasma device in its current stage of development that is engineered as a consumer product to enable an alternative physical and insecticide-free option for the treatment of pediculosis. An efficacy study concerning different developmental stages of P. humanus humanus is presented. P. humanus humanus was chosen as a substitute test organism for P. humanus capitis due to possible laboratory rearing and high anatomic similarity. The study shows how a single stroke of the plasma device over a hair strand (approximately 22 cm in length with a weight of 1.5 g) led to mortality rates of 68.3% (50.0; 79.7) (95% CI) in the juvenile test group, a mortality rate of approx. 67.7% (54.9; 78.8) (95% CI) in the female test group, and approx. 46.7% (28.3; 65.7) (95% CI) in the male test group. When single eggs were introduced directly into the plasma for approx. 1 s, younger eggs (0\u207b2 d) showed a higher mortality of 66.7% (42.7; 82.7) than the older (4\u207b6 d) eggs, with 16.7% (5.6; 34.7) (CI). Furthermore, the results of a risk assessment of the device are described. The article concludes with necessary handling instructions as well as further developmental steps, derived from the results of the efficacy and the risk assessment study."}

To evaluate and compare the physiological consequences of adult L. salmonis infections, smolts of Atlantic Salmon and Sockeye Salmon O. nerka were exposed to 2 (low), 6 (medium), or 10 (high) adult female lice/fish. Mean lice abundance decreased over time in all groups. Skin disruption due to parasite infection was observed in both species. Plasma samples were collected from infected fish and uninfected controls at 1, 3, 5, and 7\u00a0d postinfection and measured for indicators of osmoregulatory function and stress. Sockeye Salmon, regardless of L. salmonis exposure level, showed a rapid onset of elevated osmolality and sodium and chloride ion concentrations which were sustained until 7\u00a0d postinfection when values returned to levels comparable with the unexposed controls. Conversely, these effects were not measured in Atlantic Salmon. Additionally, differential host effects in blood glucose levels were observed, with Sockeye Salmon displaying immediate elevation in glucose. Relative to Atlantic Salmon, infection with L. salmonis caused a profound physiological impact to Sockeye Salmon characterized by loss of osmoregulatory integrity and a stress response. This work provides the first comprehensive report of the physiological consequences of infections with adult L. salmonis in Sockeye Salmon smolts and helps to further define the mechanisms of susceptibility in this species."}

However, silicones are lipophilic substances and do\u00a0not only leave the hair greasy but they are also\u00a0difficult to wash out. We have evaluated the\u00a0efficacy and safety of a potential solution to this problem: an aqueous dispersion of a novel silylated polyol that has the same mode of action as dimethicone (suffocation) without its negative impact on hair characteristics. METHODS:This was a randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded, bicentric study that was conducted at two locations in the state of Florida (USA) to compare the test product (medical device) to a pyrethrum-based pediculicide that is a first-line, prescription-free treatment against head lice in the USA. The subjects (n\u2009=\u200970) were randomly divided into two groups of 35 persons (test product group and reference product group), with each participant receiving two applications (day 0 and 7) of the product to be tested, according to the instructions for use. Efficacy and safety was evaluated at distinct time points. The primary objective was to establish a cure rate for the test product that was better than 70% at study end (day 10). Esthetic effects of the test product versus dimethicone were evaluated in a blinded, cross-over consumer study (n\u2009=\u2009100). RESULTS:At study end, the cure rate (corrected for re-infestation) of 88.2% with the test product significantly surpassed the pre-defined target of 70%, and thus the superiority of the test product versus the reference product was confirmed. The number of subjects cured (free of head lice) after the first treatment was remarkably higher with the test product than with the reference product (57.1 vs. 2.9%, respectively). Both products were safe and well tolerated and both showed beneficial esthetical effects. The consumer test demonstrated that the test product had better washing-out properties than dimethicone, as reflected by a significantly lower average rinsing time and number of washings required to restore the visual aspect of the hair, especially in terms of greasiness. CONCLUSION:Aqueous dispersions of silylated polyols are a promising new class of pediculicides that combine high cure rates with optimal user convenience (short treatment period, easy wash-out with positive effect on hair quality).

In this study, a series of experiments were conducted to characterize the glue-like material of the nit sheath. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy on embryo-cleared nit showed proteinaceous amide I bands. With this result, we determined the amino acid composition of the nit sheath proteins and performed similarity search against the protein products of the body louse genome to identify the candidate nit sheath proteins. The identified two homologous proteins newly named as louse nit sheath protein (LNSP) 1 and LNSP2 are composed of three domains of characteristic repeating sequences. The N-terminal and middle domains consist of tandem two-residue repeats of Gln-Ala and Gly-Ala, respectively, which are expected to fold into \u03b2-strands and may further stack into \u03b2-sheets, whereas the C-terminal domain contains multiple consecutive Gln residues. Temporal and spatial transcription profiling demonstrated that both LNSP1 and LNSP2 are most predominantly expressed in the accessory gland of females of egg-laying stage, supporting that they indeed encode the nit sheath proteins. Further adhesive property of recombinant partial LNSP1 suggests that both LNSP1 and LNSP2 may act as glues."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi) are ectoparasitic copepods which have a large negative economic and welfare impact in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture, particularly in Chile. A multi-faceted prevention and control strategy is required to tackle lice, and selective breeding contributes via cumulative improvement of host resistance to the parasite. While host resistance has been shown to be heritable, little is yet known about the individual loci that contribute to this resistance, the potential underlying genes, and their mechanisms of action. In this study we took a multifaceted approach to identify and characterise quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting hose resistance in a population of 2,688 Caligus-challenged Atlantic salmon post-smolts from a commercial breeding programme. We used low and medium density genotyping to collect genome-wide SNP marker data for all animals. Moderate heritablility estimates of 0.28 and 0.24 were obtained for lice density (as a measure of host resistance) and growth during infestation respectively. Three QTL explaining between 7 and 13 % of the genetic variation in resistance to sea lice (as represented by the traits of lice density) were detected on chromosomes 3, 18 and 21. Characterisation of these QTL regions was undertaken using RNA sequencing and pooled whole genome sequencing data. This resulted in the identification of a shortlist of potential underlying causative genes, and candidate functional mutations for further study. For example, candidates within the chromosome 3 QTL include a putative premature stop mutation in TOB1 (an anti-proliferative transcription factor involved in T cell regulation) and an uncharacterized protein which showed significant differential allelic expression (implying the existence of a cis-acting regulatory mutation). While host resistance to sea lice is polygenic in nature, the results of this study highlight significant QTL regions together explaining a moderate proportion of the heritability of the trait. Future investigation of these QTL may enable improved knowledge of the functional mechanisms of host resistance to sea lice, and incorporation of functional variants to improve genomic selection accuracy."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Control of the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi in the Chilean salmonid industry is reliant on chemical treatments. Azamethiphos was introduced in 2013, although other organophosphates were previously used. In 2014, reduced sensitivity to azamethiphos was detected in the Los Lagos Region using bioassays. The main target of organophosphates is the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Mutations in the AChE gene are the main cause of organophosphate resistance in arthropods, including other sea lice. In the present study, we aimed to characterize C. rogercresseyi AChE(s) gene(s) and to study the association between AChE variants and azamethiphos resistance in this sea louse species. METHODS:Samples of adult male and female C. rogercresseyi were collected in the Los Lagos Region in 2014. Twenty-four hour exposure bioassays with azamethiphos were performed to select sensitive and resistant lice. The full-length cDNA coding sequences encoding for two AChEs in C. rogercresseyi were molecularly characterized. One of the AChE genes was screened by direct sequencing in the azamethiphos-selected lice to search for variants. An additional louse sampling was performed before and after an azamethiphos treatment in the field in 2017 to validate the findings. RESULTS:The molecular analysis revealed two putative AChEs in C. rogercresseyi. In silico analysis and 3D modelling of the protein sequences identified both of them as invertebrate AChE type 1; they were named C. rogercresseyi AChE1a and 1b. AChE1a had the characteristics of the main synaptic AChE, while AChE1b lacked some of the important amino acids of a typical AChE. A missense change found in the main synaptic AChE (1a), F318F/V (F290 in Torpedo californica), was associated with survival of C. rogercresseyi at high azamethiphos concentrations (bioassays and field treatment). The amino acid change was located in the acyl pocket of the active-site gorge of the protein. CONCLUSIONS:The present study demonstrates the presence of two types of AChE1 genes in C. rogercresseyi. Although enzymatic assays are needed, AChE1a is most probably the main synaptic AChE. The function of AChE1b is unknown, but evidence points to a scavenger role. The AChE1a F/V318 variant is most probably involved in organophosphate resistance, and can be a good marker for resistance monitoring."}

We aimed to document the relationship between ectoparasite load and host phenotype, and test for an association between the mtDNA diversity of the lice and their hosts, which is predicted based on maternal care. We found three feather lice species previously described for these hosts: Anaticola crassicornis (wing louse), Anatoecus dentatus (head louse), and Trinoton querquedulae (body louse). No new or rare lice species were uncovered. Most ducks in our sample were more Mallard-like than Grey Duck-like hybrids for the five colour and plumage traits examined. We confirm that based solely on phenotypic characters it is difficult to distinguish between Mallards, hybrids and Grey Ducks. We detected no association between the number of lice and host phenotype for two of the three louse species (while controlling for bird size). However, the Grey Duck-like hybrids had fewer head lice (A. dentatus) than their Mallard-like counterparts. Only three of the 40 hosts had mtDNA haplotypes that characterise Grey Ducks. We present the first genetic data of Anaticola crassicornis, Anatoecus dentatus and Trinoton querquedulae from New Zealand waterfowl. We found that the lice mtDNA had greater sequence diversity than the homologous gene for the ducks. A mitochondrial phylogeny for A. crassicornis collected from hosts worldwide has been previously published, and we added our novel data to infer evolutionary relationships among worldwide populations of this louse. None of the three lice species showed a close association of parasite and host mtDNA lineage despite lack of paternal care in these duck species."}

Ivermectin is an effective treatment for both conditions, although the doses used vary. At a community level, mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin is an effective strategy to decrease prevalence of scabies. To what extent MDA with ivermectin will also reduce prevalence of head lice is unknown. METHODOLOGY:Head lice prevalence was assessed before and after MDA with oral ivermectin (at a dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram of body weight) administered on day 1 and day 8. The primary outcome was the change in prevalence of head louse infestation at two weeks compared to baseline. Longer term efficacy was assessed three months after MDA. RESULTS:118 participants were enrolled. Baseline prevalence of active head louse infestation was 25.4% (95% CI 18.4-34.0). At two-week follow-up, prevalence was 2.5% (95% CI 0.9-7.2), a relative reduction of 89.1% (95% CI 72.7-91.4%, p<0.001). At three-month follow-up, prevalence was 7.5% (95% CI 2.7-12.3), a relative reduction of 70.6% (95% CI 72.7%-91.4%, p <0.001). Head louse infestation was associated with younger age (age \u226410 years: prevalence 46.7%; adjusted odds ratio compared to adults of 7.2, 95%CI 2.0-25.9) and with having at least one other member of the household with active head louse infestation (adjusted odds ratio 4.3, 95%CI 1.7-11.1). CONCLUSIONS:Head louse infestation is common in the Solomon Islands. This proof of principle study shows that oral ivermectin at a dose of 200 micrograms per kilogram can reduce the burden of active head louse infestation, offering an additional collateral benefit of MDA with ivermectin for scabies control.

Ensuring that in-feed medication is delivered appropriately, and that fish achieve an adequate tissue concentration of the medication is critical to a successful treatment. The muscle tissue concentration of emamectin benzoate was assessed post SLICE\u00ae treatment in 867 Atlantic salmon from 147 treatments. Approximately 90% of the muscle samples that included skin had emamectin benzoate levels above 60 ng/g (ppb); however, only 63.8% of muscle samples without skin were at or above this threshold. Further, we found a wide range of tissue concentrations across our samples, with some fish as high as 398 ng/g. The variation in the emamectin benzoate concentration in our samples was associated with the following factors: feeding rate, whether or not the muscle sample contained skin, year of the sample, laboratory analyzing the tissue, prescribed dose, and condition factor, after controlling for temperature, day of the sample post-treatment, and pen effect. Interestingly, the positive relationship between condition factor and the concentration of emamectin benzoate in the tissue sample was dependent on the dose of medication in the feed. In other words, increasing the dose of emamectin benzoate had a greater effect on the concentration of drug in tissues for fish with a high condition factor compared to fish with a low condition factor. Our findings suggest that the feeding rate and fish feeding behavior within a pen may be important factors to consider when applying medicated feed to fish populations to ensure a more even distribution of medication between animals."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Connectivity in an aquatic setting is determined by a combination of hydrodynamic circulation and the biology of the organisms driving linkages. These complex processes can be simulated in coupled biological-physical models. The physical model refers to an underlying circulation model defined by spatially-explicit nodes, often incorporating a particle-tracking model. The particles can then be given biological parameters or behaviors (such as maturity and/or survivability rates, diel vertical migrations, avoidance, or seeking behaviors). The output of the bio-physical models can then be used to quantify connectivity among the nodes emitting and/or receiving the particles. Here we propose a method that makes use of kernel density estimation (KDE) on the output of a particle-tracking model, to quantify the infection or infestation pressure (IP) that each node causes on the surrounding area. Because IP is the product of both exposure time and the concentration of infectious agent particles, using KDE (which also combine elements of time and space), more accurately captures IP. This method is especially useful for those interested in infectious agent networks, a situation where IP is a superior measure of connectivity than the probability of particles from each node reaching other nodes. Here we illustrate the method by modeling the connectivity of salmon farms via sea lice larvae in the Broughton Archipelago, British Columbia, Canada. Analysis revealed evidence of two sub-networks of farms connected via a single farm, and evidence that the highest IP from a given emitting farm was often tens of kilometers or more away from that farm. We also classified farms as net emitters, receivers, or balanced, based on their structural role within the network. By better understanding how these salmon farms are connected to each other via their sea lice larvae, we can effectively focus management efforts to minimize the spread of sea lice between farms, advise on future site locations and coordinated treatment efforts, and minimize any impact of farms on juvenile wild salmon. The method has wide applicability for any system where capturing infectious agent networks can provide useful guidance for management or preventative planning decisions."}

We explored the use of mitochondrial (mt) genome fragmentation in resolving the controversial suborder-level phylogeny of parasitic lice (order Phthiraptera). There are \u223c5,000 species of parasitic lice in four suborders (Amblycera, Ischnocera, Rhynchophthirina and Anoplura), which infest mammals and birds. The phylogenetic relationships among these suborders are unresolved despite decades of studies. We sequenced the mt genomes of eight species of parasitic lice and compared them with 17 other species of parasitic lice sequenced previously. We found that the typical single-chromosome mt genome is retained in the lice of birds but fragmented into many minichromosomes in the lice of eutherian mammals. The shared derived feature of mt genome fragmentation unites the eutherian mammal lice of Ischnocera (family Trichodectidae) with Anoplura and Rhynchophthirina to the exclusion of the bird lice of Ischnocera (family Philopteridae). The novel clade, namely Mitodivisia, is also supported by phylogenetic analysis of mt genome and cox1 gene sequences.

It is widely believed that physically acting products are effectively \u201cresistance proofed\u201d because they do not act to inhibit any particular physiological mechanism and most have some kind of occlusive effect on the target organism. Over the past 20 years various new active materials have been utilized ranging from natural oils, synthetic oils, through to surfactants both as excipients and active substances. Relatively few of these products have been adequately tested clinically and, of those that have, there is now some indication that they are less effective than when first introduced. The question therefore arises whether lice can become resistant to these physically acting products. Only adequate testing both in the laboratory and in clinical trials can determine their real effectiveness and claiming efficacy based on the presence of a named chemical rather than demonstrated activity may result in acquired resistance to these types of product also."}

Mortality of the lumpfish rose with decreasing sea temperatures to around 0.8% week-1 and did not vary between the lumpfish groups. There were clear signs of lumpfish grazing on sea lice, with significantly lower average levels of chalimus, pre-adult and adult female Lepeophtheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus sea lice per salmon. Lumpfish in the high density (8%) group reduced the mature female L. salmonis to levels equal to or lower than the counts recorded prior to the start of the study.

Substantial resources are applied to sea lice control and the development of new technologies towards this end. Identifying and understanding how sea lice population patterns vary among cages on a salmon farm can be an important step in the design and analysis of any sea lice control strategy. Norway's intense monitoring efforts have provided salmon farmers and researchers with a wealth of sea lice infestation data. A frequently registered parameter is the number of adult female sea lice per cage. These time-series data can be analysed descriptively, the similarity between time-series quantified, so that groups and patterns can be identified among cages, using clustering algorithms capable of handling such dynamic data. We apply such algorithms to investigate the pattern of female sea lice counts among cages for three Atlantic salmon farms in Norway. A series of strategies involving a combination of distance measures and prototypes were explored and cluster evaluation was performed using cluster validity indices. Repeated agreement on cluster membership for different combinations of distance and centroids was taken to be a strong indicator of clustering while the stability of these results reinforced this likelihood. Though drivers behind clustering are not thoroughly investigated here, it appeared that fish weight at time of stocking and other management practices were strongly related to cluster membership. In addition to these internally driven factors it is also possible that external sources of infestation may drive patterns of sea lice infestation in groups of cages; for example, those most proximal to an external source. This exploratory method proved useful as a pattern discovery tool for cages in salmon farms."}

Since the use of pesticides has become less effective in controlling infestations due to evolving resistance in the salmon louse, the development of novel non-medical control methods is in focus. A variety of new methods are being launched, but limited effort is spent on documenting control effects. Here we present an analysis that quantifies the effect of shielding farmed salmon from exposure to infestive salmon lice by using plankton nets surrounding the upper parts of cages. The temporal development of salmon louse infestations was compared for production cages shielded with 10 m and/or 6 m deep plankton nets, or no nets (controls), in five full scale salmon farms. Only weeks where lice counts were available from both control cages and plankton net shielded cages were included in the data. Varying external and internal infestation pressure exposing the test farms was controlled for in the analysis by quantifying the reproduction of infestive lice from external farms and from the test farm. We found that use of plankton nets significantly reduced the rate of new salmon louse infestation. The shielding effect amounted to an estimated 30% weekly reduction (95% CI: 18\u201341%) in the rate of new infestations of pre-adult and adult male lice (PAAM) one week ahead in large scale production cages. We conclude that the use of plankton nets represents a non-medical complementary method in the pest management of salmon lice that may reduce the need for treatments, either with pesticides or other non-medical measures, and further contribute to conserve effects of pesticides used to control salmon lice infestations in salmon farming."}

However, the factors shaping the frequency of hybridization are still poorly understood, and therefore how dispersal ability affects the opportunities for hybridization is still unknown. Here, using the ecological replicate system of dove wing and body lice (Insecta: Phthiraptera) 6 , we show that species with higher dispersal abilities exhibited increased genomic signatures of introgression. Specifically, we found a higher proportion of introgressed genomic reads and more reticulated phylogenetic networks in wing lice, the louse group with higher dispersal abilities. Our results illustrate how differences in dispersal ability can drive differences in the extent of introgression through hybridization. The results from this study represent an important step for understanding the factors driving hybridization. We expect our approach will stimulate future studies on the ecological factors shaping hybridization to further understand this important process."}

This study analyzed genetic diversity at three mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b [cytb], cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 [cox1] and 12S ribosomal RNA [12S]) in 98 head lice collected from an isolated Native American population from the Wayampi community in Trois-Sauts, French Guiana. These results are integrated with all prior data of P.\u202fhumanus (1402 cytb, 743 cox1 and 344 12S) from other parts of the world. The phylogenetic analysis revealed six highly divergent and well-supported monophyletic clades. Five clades corresponded to the previously recognized mitochondrial clades A, D, B, C and E, while the sixth (clade F) was novel, as it exhibited 5.4%, 3.7% and 3.6% divergence at cytb, cox1 and 12S, respectively, from its nearest neighbor clade B. Interestingly, the clade F has only been recovered in a few lice sequences from Mexico and Argentina, while it was the most common lineage in the Amazonian lice, which hints its association with the Native American region. Furthermore, Pediculus mjobergi, a New World monkeys' louse, which is thought to be transmitted to monkeys from the first humans that had reached the American continent thousands of years ago, also belonged to this clade, suggesting that this louse may not be a separate species but an evolutionary lineage of P.\u202fhumanus. The discovery of new Amazonian clade F with the recovery of additional haplotypes within each of the five clades demonstrates that the levels of genetic diversity in P.\u202fhumanus are higher than previously thought."}

Hence, there is a need for insight into how increases in salmon production, varying spatial organisation of the production and pest control strategies affect salmon louse population dynamics. Here we present a new salmon louse model for exploring effects of varying salmon farming conditions on spatio-temporal abundances of the parasite. The salmon louse model is partly stage-structured, comprising of (i) adult female lice and (ii) other mobile stages of lice. The abundance of adult females depend on survival of females from previous weeks and recruitment from the other mobile group of lice. The other mobiles also depend on survival of other mobiles from previous weeks, as well as recruitment from the previous generation of reproducing adult females from the same farm or from farms in the neighbourhood. In addition, expected abundances of the two stage-groups are modelled as functions of biological and physical covariates. The model is fitted to weekly salmon farm data covering all marine farms producing salmonids along the Norwegian cost over the years 2012-2016. Among novel results from fitting the model are estimates of the time-lag structure representing recruitment of other mobile lice from the previous generation adult females for different temperatures. Furthermore, the model estimates how various factors affect the susceptibility of fish on farms to louse infection and effects of treatments to control infection. Finally, the model estimates density dependent effects of increasing the number of fish in farms and of increasing the numbers of farms, on the rate of recruitment of other mobile lice. Analytically, the parameters representing density dependencies suggest that few farms with many fish and large between farm distances is effective in terms of minimising the overall output of salmon lice infection."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "The Norwegian government has decided that the aquaculture industry shall grow, provided that the growth is environmentally sustainable. Sustainability is scored based on the mortality of wild salmonids caused by the parasitic salmon lice. Salmon lice infestation pressure has traditionally been monitored through catching wild sea trout and Arctic char using nets or traps or by trawling after Atlantic salmon postsmolts. However, due to that the Norwegian mainland coastline is nearly 25 000 km, complementary methods that may be used in order to give complete results are needed. We have therefore developed an operational salmon lice model, which calculates the infestation pressure all along the coast in near real-time based on a hydrodynamical ocean model and a salmon lice particle tracking model. The hydrodynamic model generally shows a negative temperature bias and a positive salinity bias compared to observations. The modeled salmon lice dispersion correlates with measured lice on wild salmonids caught using traps or nets. This allows for using two complementary data sources in order to determine the infestation pressure of lice originating from fish farms on wild salmonids, and thereby provide an improved monitoring system for assessing risk and sustainability which forms the basis for knowledge-based advice to management authorities."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Macroparasites, such as ticks, lice, and helminths, are a concern in livestock and aquaculture production, and can be controlled by genetic improvement of the host population. Genetic improvement should aim at reducing the rate at which parasites spread across the farmed population. This rate is determined by the basic reproduction ratio, i.e. [Formula: see text], which is the appropriate breeding goal trait. This study aims at providing a method to derive the economic value of [Formula: see text]. METHODS:Costs of a disease are the sum of production losses and expenditures on disease control. Genetic improvement of [Formula: see text] lowers the loss-expenditure frontier. Its economic effect depends on whether the management strategy is optimized or not. The economic value may be derived either from the reduction in losses with constant expenditures or from the reduction in expenditures with constant losses. RESULTS:When [Formula: see text]\u2009\u2264\u20091, the economic value of a further reduction is zero because there is no risk of a major epidemic. When [Formula: see text]\u2009>\u20091 and management is optimized, the economic value increases with decreasing values of [Formula: see text], because both the mean number of parasites per host and frequency of treatments decrease at an increasing rate when [Formula: see text] decreases. When [Formula: see text]\u2009>\u20091 and management is not optimized, the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reducing expenditures or losses. For sea lice in salmon, the economic value depends on a reduction in expenditures with constant losses, and is estimated to be 0.065\u20ac/unit [Formula: see text]/kg production. DISCUSSION:Response to selection for measures of disease prevalence cannot be predicted from quantitative genetic theory alone. Moreover, many studies fail to address the issue of whether genetic improvement results in reduced losses or expenditures. Using [Formula: see text] as the breeding goal trait, weighed by its appropriate economic value, avoids these issues. CONCLUSION:When management is optimized, the economic value increases with decreasing values of [Formula: see text] (until the threshold of [Formula: see text], where it drops to zero). When management is not optimized, the economic value depends on whether genetic improvement is used for reduced expenditures or production losses. For sea lice in salmon, the economic value is estimated to be 0.065\u00a0\u20ac/unit [Formula: see text]/kg production."}

Up to 13 different species of lice have been reported to affect peacocks worldwide and heavy infestation may cause anaemia. Because of this, alternatives to the prevailing treatments have been sought including use of isoxazolines. This class of drugs has been used successfully in poultry without adverse effects on health or production. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effect of afoxolaner on the peacock louse (Goniodes pavonis). ANIMALS:Twenty-three peacocks (Pavo cristatus) with naturally occurring infestation with G.\u00a0pavonis. METHODS AND MATERIALS:The peacocks were divided in two groups; one was treated once orally with 2.5\u00a0mg/kg afoxolaner and the other group received no treatment. Samples were collected using the acetate tape technique, for identification of lice by microscopy. Concomitantly, blood samples were taken to evaluate the haematocrit before and after the intervention. RESULTS:Treatment with afoxolaner significantly decreased the number of peacocks positive for lice (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) compared to the control group, in which the number of positive birds did not decrease. The haematocrit improved in the afoxolaner-treated group from a baseline of 46.4%-54.7% at 35\u00a0days post-treatment, whereas it decreased in untreated birds (44.6%-40.7%). No adverse effects attributed to afoxolaner treatment were observed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE:Oral administration of afoxolaner is an effective treatment for G.\u00a0pavonis infestation of peacocks."}

Recently, however, the first field-evolved ivermectin-resistance in lice was reported. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying ivermectin-resistance, we both looked for mutations in the ivermectin-target site (GluCl) and searched the entire proteome for potential new loci involved in resistance from laboratory susceptible and ivermectin-selected resistant body lice. Polymorphism analysis of cDNA GluCl showed no non-silent mutations. Proteomic analysis identified 22 differentially regulated proteins, of which 13 were upregulated and 9 were downregulated in the resistant strain. We evaluated the correlation between mRNA and protein levels by qRT-PCR and found that the trend in transcriptional variation was consistent with the proteomic changes. Among differentially expressed proteins, a complexin i.e. a neuronal protein which plays a key role in regulating neurotransmitter release, was shown to be the most significantly down-expressed in the ivermectin-resistant lice. Moreover, DNA-mutation analysis revealed that some complexin transcripts from resistant lice gained a premature stop codon, suggesting that this down-expression might be due, in part, to secondary effects of a nonsense mutation inside the gene. We further confirmed the association between complexin and ivermectin-resistance by RNA-interfering and found that knocking down the complexin expression induces resistance to ivermectin in susceptible lice. Our results provide evidence that complexin plays a significant role in regulating ivermectin resistance in body lice and represents the first evidence that links complexin to insecticide resistance."}

Frequent chemotherapeutic treatments are typically required to control this parasite, and alternative measures such as breeding for improved host resistance are desirable. Insight into the host-parasite interaction and mechanisms of host resistance can lead to improvements in selective breeding, and potentially novel treatment targets. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to study the skin transcriptome of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) parasitized with sea lice (Caligus rogercresseyi). The overall aims were to compare the transcriptomic profile of skin at louse attachment sites and \"healthy\" skin, and to assess differences in gene expression response between animals with varying levels of resistance to the parasite. Atlantic salmon pre-smolts were challenged with C. rogercresseyi, growth and lice count measurements were taken for each fish. 21 animals were selected and RNA-Seq was performed on skin from a louse attachment site, and skin distal to attachment sites for each animal. These animals were classified into family-balanced groups according to the traits of resistance (high vs. low lice count), and growth during infestation. Overall comparison of skin from louse attachment sites vs. healthy skin showed that 4,355 genes were differentially expressed, indicating local up-regulation of several immune pathways and activation of tissue repair mechanisms. Comparison between resistant and susceptible animals highlighted expression differences in several immune response and pattern recognition genes, and also myogenic and iron availability factors. Components of the pathways involved in differential response to sea lice may be targets for studies aimed at improved or novel treatment strategies, or to prioritize candidate functional polymorphisms to enhance genomic selection for host resistance in commercial salmon breeding programs."}

Numbers of sea lice on fish increase over time at relatively predictable rates when the environment is conducive to the parasite's survival and fish are not undergoing treatment. We developed a tool for the salmon industry in Chile that predicts the abundance of adult sea lice over time on farms that are relatively isolated. We used data on sea louse abundance collected through the SalmonChile INTESAL sea lice monitoring program to create series of weekly lice counts between lice treatment events on isolated farms. We defined isolated farms as those with no known neighbors within a 10\u2009km seaway distance and no more than two neighbors within a 20\u2009km seaway distance. We defined the time between sea lice treatments as starting the week immediately post treatment and ending the week before a subsequent treatment. Our final dataset of isolated farms consisted of 65 series from 32 farms, between 2009 and 2015. Given an observed abundance at time t\u2009=\u20090, we built a model that predicted 8 consecutive weekly sea louse abundance levels, based on the preceding week's lice prediction. We calibrated the parameters in our model on a randomly selected subset of training data, choosing the parameter combinations that minimized the absolute difference between the predicted and observed sea louse abundance values. We validated the parameters on the remaining, unseen, subset of data. We encoded our model and made it available as a Web-accessible applet for producers. We determined a threshold, based on the upper 97.5% predictive interval, as a guideline for producers using the tool. We hypothesize that if farms exceed this threshold, especially if the sea lice levels are above this threshold 2 and 4 weeks into the model predictions, the sea louse population on the farm is likely influenced by sources other than lice within the farm."}

We document the louse genera collected from birds sampled in Peru (2006-2007) and Colombia (2009-2016), from 22 localities across a variety of ecosystems, ranging from lowland tropical forest and Llanos to high elevation cloud forest. We identified 35 louse genera from a total of 210 bird species belonging to 37 avian families and 13 orders. These genera belong to two suborders and three families of lice: Amblycera, families Menoponidae (present on 131 bird species) and Ricinidae (39 bird species); and Ischnocera, family Philopteridae (119 bird species). We compared our bird-louse associations with data in Price et al. (2003) and recently published Neotropical studies. The majority of bird-louse associations (51.9%) were new, with most of these coming from Passeriformes, the most diverse avian order, with the most poorly known louse fauna.

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Ecological speciation occurs when local adaptation generates reproductive isolation as a by-product of natural selection. Although ecological speciation is a fundamental source of diversification, the mechanistic link between natural selection and reproductive isolation remains poorly understood, especially in natural populations. Here we show that experimental evolution of parasite body size over four years (ca. 60 generations) leads to reproductive isolation in natural populations of feather lice on birds. When lice are transferred to pigeons of different sizes they rapidly evolve differences in body size that are correlated with host size. These size differences trigger mechanical mating isolation between lice that are locally adapted to the different sized hosts. Size differences among lice also influence the outcome of competition between males for access to females. Thus, body size directly mediates reproductive isolation through its influence on both inter-sexual compatibility and intra-sexual competition. Our results confirm that divergent natural selection acting on a single phenotypic trait can cause reproductive isolation to emerge from a single natural population in real time."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "We evaluated the use of coordinated fallowing as a means to control salmon lice Lepeophtheirus salmonis infestation in farmed Atlantic salmon Salmo salar. In discrete management zones, aquaculture operations such as stocking, fallowing, treatments and harvesting are synchronized at all sites in coordinated areas within the zones. The expected benefit of synchronized generations is to reduce the presence of salmon lice larvae after a period of fallowing, as well as to minimize external infestation pressure from surrounding aquaculture sites. A regression analysis was used to evaluate the effectiveness of coordinated fallowing on the progression of external salmon lice infestation pressure and abundance in Atlantic salmon farming sites in 2 areas (zones) in Norway. The overall results show that external infestation pressure was higher inside than outside the management zones, and the external infestation pressure increased with increasing biomass throughout the production cycle. However, within the zones, the external infestation pressure at the beginning of a production cycle was high and in many cases even higher than the general external infestation pressure in the non-coordinated areas. This suggests that external infestation pressure from the neighboring areas has a considerable effect on the fallowed area. Higher numbers of salmon lice were recorded within the zones than outside and, as the production cycle progressed, this phenomenon became more evident. We conclude that the high infestation pressure from salmon lice at the beginning of the grow-out period after fallowing raises severe doubts about the effectiveness of coordinated fallowing practices."}

Here we show rapid adaptive divergence of experimentally evolving feather lice in response to preening, the main host defense. We demonstrate that host defense exerts strong phenotypic selection for crypsis in lice transferred to different colored rock pigeons (Columba livia). During four years of experimental evolution (~ 60 generations), the lice evolved heritable differences in color. The color differences spanned the phenotypic distribution of congeneric species of lice adapted to other species of pigeons. Our results indicate that host-mediated selection triggers rapid divergence in the adaptive radiation of parasites, which are among the most diverse organisms on earth. Our research suggests that host defense should be included with competition and predation as a major mechanism driving the evolution of biodiversity by adaptive radiation."}

Secondly, lice on most hosts in these families appear to be more closely related to lice on other host families than to each other.

Potentially, the tendency of the hosts to participate in mixed-species feeding flocks may explain some of these patterns."}

Phylogenetically, they occur in five divergent mitochondrial clades (A, D, B, C and E), each having a particular geographical distribution. Recent studies have revealed that head lice, as is the case of body lice, can act as a vector for louse-borne diseases. Here, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of head lice collected from Niger's refugees (migrant population) arriving in Algeria, northern Africa, and to look for louse-borne pathogens. Comparative head lice samples collected from indigenous population of schoolchildren (non-immigrant) were also analyzed to frame the study. RESULTS:In this study, 37 head lice samples were collected from 31 Nigerien refugees, as well as 45 head lice from 27 schoolchildren. The collection was established in three localities of eastern Algiers, north Algeria. Quantitative real-time PCR screening of pathogens bacteria and the genetic characterisation of the head lice satut were performed. Through amplification and sequencing of the cytb gene, results showed that all head lice of Nigerien refugees 37/82 (45.12%) belonged to clade E with the presence of four new haplotypes, while, of the 45 head lice of schoolchildren, 34/82 lice (41.46%) belonged to clade A and 11/82 (13.41%) belonged to clade B. Our study is the first to report the existence of clade E haplogroup in Nigerien head lice. DNA of Coxiella burnetii was detected in 3/37 (8.10%) of the head lice collected from 3 of the 31 (9.67%) migrant population. We also revealed the presence of Acinetobacter DNA in 20/37 (54.05%) of head lice collected from 25/31 (80.64%) of the Nigerien refugees, and in 25/45 (55.55%) head lice collected from 15/27 (55.55%) schoolchildren. All positive Nigerien-head lice for Acinetobacter spp. were identified as A. baumannii, while positive schoolchildren-head lice were identified as A. johnsonii 15/25 (60%), A. variabilis 8/25 (32%) and A. baumannii 2/25 (8%). CONCLUSIONS:Based on these findings from head lice collected on migrant and non-migrant population, our results show, for the first time, that head lice from Niger belong to haplogroup E, and confirm that the clade E had a west African distribution. We also detected, for the first time, the presence of C. burnetii and A. baumannii in these Nigerien head lice. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to determine whether the head lice can transmit these pathogenic bacteria from one person to another."}

Closed containment systems (CCS) have the potential to eliminate the problems with sea lice and to reduce escapes and emissions. When closing the cages, water volumes and velocity are regulated and the identification of optimal current velocities for growth and fish welfare from sea transfer to harvest size becomes necessary. This study describes two trials with LOW (0.10\u20130.27 BL/s) and MODERATE (0.36\u20130.63 BL/s) water velocity on performance of post-smolt Atlantic salmon in CCS.

The MODERATE group obtained specific growth rate (SGR) of 0.76 and thermal growth coefficient (TGC) of 2.75, compared to 0.72 and 2.56 in the LOW group. MODERATE water velocity was also associated with higher relative heart size (RHS) (p\u202f=\u202f.016), higher liver index (HSI) (p\u202f=\u202f.005), increased fillet yield (p\u202f\u2264\u202f.001) and lower levels of cathepsin activity in muscle tissue.

Pyrethroids, which block arthropod voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav 1), are used for salmon delousing. However, pyrethroid resistance is common in L. salmonis. The present study characterized Nav 1 homologues in L. salmonis in order to identify channel mutations associated to resistance, called kdr (knockdown) mutations. RESULTS:Genome scans identified three L. salmonis Nav 1 homologues, LsNav 1.1, LsNav 1.2 and LsNav 1.3. Arthropod kdr mutations map to specific Nav 1 regions within domains DI-III, namely segments S5 and S6 and the linker helix connecting S4 and S5. The above channel regions were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced in deltamethrin-susceptible and deltamethrin-resistant L. salmonis. While LsNav 1.1 and LsNav 1.2 lacked nucleotide polymorphisms showing association to resistance, LsNav 1.3 showed a non-synonymous mutation in S5 of DII occurring in deltamethrin-resistant parasites. The mutation is homologous to a previously described kdr mutation (I936V, numbering according to Musca domestica Vssc1) and was present in two pyrethroid-resistant L. salmonis strains (allele frequencies of 0.800 and 0.357), but absent in two pyrethroid-susceptible strains. CONCLUSIONS:The present study indicates that a kdr-mutation in LsNaV 1.3 may contribute to deltamethrin resistance in L. salmonis. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."}

A. foliaceus is distributed worldwide and causes major economic impacts for cultured freshwater fish globally. The work described in this study was undertaken with the objective of identifying, describing and characterising glands associated with feeding in A. foliaceus. From structural and ultrastructural microscopic studies of A. foliaceus, three types of gland were determined to be associated with the pre-oral spine and mouth tube and were suggested to be involved in feeding activities. Two of these glands, the labial glands and the proboscis glands, appeared to secrete their products via the mouth tube and a third, the spinal gland, was connected directly to the pre-oral spine. The current study confirmed that the pre-oral spine delivers active secretions from the spinal gland, which may aid in immunomodulation, while the tubular labial spines and proboscis glands openings within the mouth tube may serve to enhance the feeding process by delivering salivary components to aid pre-digestion and immune-modulate the host. The suggested functions are supported by histological and histochemical staining, coupled with fluorescent lectin-binding assays, which enabled characterisation of the carbohydrate moieties associated with these glandular tissues."}

Although pediculicidal agents effectively kill head lice, the re-infestation rate is still high. Thus, prevention is an important strategy for any sustainable control program. We aimed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a health education program for increasing knowledge, changing attitudes and promoting preventive practices to reduce prevalence of pediculosis among school girls in Amphoe Muang, Khon Kaen, northeastern Thailand. METHODOLOGY:Six schools were selected using multistage simple randomization and were allocated into intervention or control groups. A total of 267 girls was enrolled from these schools. A \"knowledge, attitude and practice\" (KAP) questionnaire, consent forms and health education materials were constructed and tested by experts and in one pilot school before the main investigation. Baseline prevalence of adult lice and nits was determined. The health education package was given only to the intervention group. The KAP questionnaire was re-evaluated at two months after intervention. RESULTS:At baseline, the prevalence and intensity of head lice infestation, and the KAP scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. After re-evaluation at two months, the KAP score was significantly greater in the intervention group. A significant decrease of the infestation rate from 59% to 44% was observed in the intervention group, whereas infestation increased in the control group (from 56% to 65%). The incidence of new cases in the intervention group (6.14%) was lower than in the control group (12.62%). CONCLUSION:These findings indicated that the newly-established health education package is an effective tool for increasing KAP and reducing head lice infestation in school girls. Efforts to combat pediculosis in schoolchildren elsewhere may consider including this, or a similar, health education package in their programs."}

SUMMARY:In the United States and globally, head lice infestation, or pediculosis capitis, remains a public health issue with both social and medical implications. Treatment with oral or topical medications is typically required for head lice eradication. Resistance to traditional topical therapies for head lice infestation is increasing, creating a need for consideration of additional treatment options. A growing body of data describing the potential role of oral ivermectin for the treatment or prevention of head lice infestation is available. A literature search identified 5 clinical trials that evaluated safety and/or effectiveness outcomes of oral ivermectin use as an alternative to malathion, other topical prescription medications, and traditional, nonprescription remedies; those studies were conducted in various parts of the world (e.g., Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt) and likely involved varying types and degrees of lice resistance. Clinical research findings to date, while not consistently robust, suggest that oral ivermectin is comparable or superior in effectiveness to other topical treatment options for head lice infestation while being well tolerated and favorably perceived by patients and caretakers. CONCLUSION:Oral ivermectin is an option for the treatment of head lice infestation, especially in individuals who have experienced a treatment failure. Published evidence from clinical trials indicates that oral ivermectin is as effective as currently available topical treatments."}

Sixty-five species of native rodents have been recorded in Australia. However, only 11 species of lice have been reported from 11 species of endemic Australian rodents. RESULTS:We describe a new species of sucking louse, Hoplopleura villosissima Wang (Psocodea: Phthiraptera: Hoplopleuridae), and report a new host record of the spiny rat louse, Polyplax spinulosa Burmeister, 1839 (Psocodea: Phthiraptera: Polyplacidae), from the long-haired rat, Rattus villosissimus Waite (Rodentia: Muridae), which is endemic to Australia. CONCLUSIONS:This study is the first record of sucking louse from R. villosissimus and the first record of a species of Polyplax Enderlein, 1904 from an endemic Australian rodent. This study brings the total number of sucking louse species in endemic Australian rodents from 11 to 13. Previously, only the introduced brown rat, Rattus norvegicus Berkenhout and the black rat, Rattus rattus Linnaeus were recorded as the hosts of P. spinulosa in Australia. Because R. villosissimus overlaps with R. rattus in distribution but not with R. norvegicus, we propose that P. spinulosa transferred to R. villosissimus from R. rattus."}

Of all Brazilian states, Par\u00e1 contains the largest number of this species, with 510,000 animals, approximately 38% of the Brazilian buffaloes. Despite the socioeconomic importance of bubaline farming in the northern region, little is known about the prevalence of ectoparasites that affect buffalo herds. This study aimed to identify the species of buffalo ectoparasites in the municipality of Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, and to determine possible risk factors related to ectoparasitic infestation. A cross-sectional study was conducted by sampling 60 rural properties and 621 buffaloes for ectoparasites. When present, ectoparasites were collected for subsequent identification. RESULTS:Of all the animals sampled, 18.5% (115/621) had ectoparasites, 7.8% (49/621) had ticks from the species Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus and Amblyomma cajennense (sensu stricto), and 11.5% (72/621) had lice from the Haematopinus tuberculatus species. Six animals presented mixed infestations of ticks and lice. Among the sampled farms, 51.6% (31/60) had at least one animal infested with ectoparasites. The prevalence of ticks and lice on buffaloes was associated with the farm site, with higher prevalence (11.5% ticks, 15.4% lice) in animals at dry land (OR: 16.7 and 5.7 for ticks and lice, respectively) when compared with floodplains (0.5% ticks, 3.4% lice). Buffaloes aged 1 to 12 months had more ticks whereas buffaloes aged 13 to 24 months had more lice (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:Buffaloes bred in the municipality of Santar\u00e9m present different levels of tick and lice infestation according to the direct influence of Amazon ecosystem characteristics. The floodplain environment, widely used for buffalo farming, contributes toward minor ectoparasite infestations in these animals."}

Chemical pediculicides have lost their efficacy because lice have developed resistance to them. Therefore, alternative pediculicides such as essential oils and herbal products have been proposed for treating head lice infestation. STUDY DESIGN:To determine the efficacy of essential oils from three Zingiberaceae plants (Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Curcuma zedoaria and Zingiber zerumbet) against head lice eggs and to investigate an augmenting substance (Eucalyptus globulus EO) for improving the efficacy of these essential oils in killing head lice eggs, especially on the inhibition of their hatching process. Permethrin pediculicide, soyabean oil, and drinking water were used as positive, negative, and neutral controls, respectively. METHODS:An immersion test was used to evaluate the ovicidal activity of 12 essential oil formulations. Head lice eggs were immersed for 1, 5 and 10\u202fmin in the treatments. Mortality rate was observed on day 7 and day 14; mortality was checked under a stereomicroscope. RESULTS:All head lice eggs that were immersed in a combination of 10% C. zedoaria EO and 10% E. globulus EO for 5\u202fmin did not hatch at all for 7-14 days of incubation. All head lice eggs that were immersed in soyabean oil and drinking water for 1, 5, and 10\u202fmin showed 100% hatching rate in 7-14 days of incubation. All head lice eggs that were immersed in permethrin pediculicide for 1, 5\u202fmin, showed 100% hatching rate, but when they were immersed for 10\u202fmin, permethrin provided 4.0-6.0% inhibition rate with 94.0-96.0% hatching rate for 7-14 days of incubation. All combinations of Zingiberaceae EOs and E. globulus EO at low and high concentrations (5 and 10%) exhibited high ovicidal activities against head lice eggs, and the combinations showed a synergistic effect with an increase in the inhibition rate of more than 50%. CONCLUSION:These results demonstrated that Zingiberaceae EOs augmented with E. globulus EO are promising ovicidal agents for head lice control."}

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Head lice infest millions of school-age children every year, both in developed and developing countries. However, little is known about the number of lice transferred among children during school activities, because direct methods to study this are almost impossible to implement. This issue has been addressed following an indirect method, which consist in collecting data of real infestation from several children groups and using a mathematical model of lice colonies to infer how the infestation observed might have evolved. By determining the events that would most likely lead to infestations as those observed, we find that severe infestations are most likely initiated by a relatively large number of lice transferred at the same moment or within relatively short time spans. In turn, analysis of the data obtained from screenings of the same groups of children a few days apart shows evidence of such transmission events. Interestingly, only children with severe infestations could harbor the lice necessary for this type of transmission. Thus, they play the same role as 'superspreaders' in epidemiology. As part of our experimental study it is also shown that a simple procedure of combing can be very effective to remove all mobile lice, and thus could be used as an effective preventive measure against those severe infestations that are responsible for the spread of pediculosis."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Dispersal is a fundamental component of the life history of most species. Dispersal influences fitness, population dynamics, gene flow, genetic drift and population genetic structure. Even small differences in dispersal can alter ecological interactions and trigger an evolutionary cascade. Linking such ecological processes with evolutionary patterns is difficult, but can be carried out in the proper comparative context. Here, we investigate how differences in phoretic dispersal influence the population genetic structure of two different parasites of the same host species. We focus on two species of host-specific feather lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera) that co-occur on feral rock pigeons (Columba livia). Although these lice are ecologically very similar, \"wing lice\" (Columbicola columbae) disperse phoretically by \"hitchhiking\" on pigeon flies (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), while \"body lice\" (Campanulotes compar) do not. Differences in the phoretic dispersal of these species are thought to underlie observed differences in host specificity, as well as the degree of host-parasite cospeciation. These ecological and macroevolutionary patterns suggest that body lice should exhibit more genetic differentiation than wing lice. We tested this prediction among lice on individual birds and among lice on birds from three pigeon flocks. We found higher levels of genetic differentiation in body lice compared to wing lice at two spatial scales. Our results indicate that differences in phoretic dispersal can explain microevolutionary differences in population genetic structure and are consistent with macroevolutionary differences in the degree of host-parasite cospeciation."}

Body lice, Pediculus h. humanus, occur in two divergent mitochondrial clades (A and D) each exhibiting a particular geographic distribution. Currently, the body louse is recognized as the only vector for louse-borne diseases. In this study, we aimed to study the genetic diversity of body lice collected from homeless populations in three localities of northern Algeria, and to investigate louse-borne pathogens in these lice.In this study, 524 body lice specimens were collected from 44 homeless people in three localities: Algiers, Tizi Ouzou and Boumerd\u00e8s located in northern Algeria. Duplex clade specific real-time PCRs (qPCR) and Cytochrome b (cytb) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analysis were performed in order to identify the mitochondrial clade. Screening of louse-borne pathogens bacteria was based on targeting specific genes for each pathogen using qPCR supplemented by sequencing. All body lice belong to clade A. Through amplification and sequencing of the cytb gene we confirmed the presence of three haplotypes: A5, A9 and A63, which is novel. The molecular investigation of the 524 body lice samples revealed the presence of four human pathogens: Bartonella quintana (13.35%), Coxiella burnetii (10.52%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (0.76%) and Acinetobacter species (A. baumannii, A. johnsonii, A. berezeniae, A. nosocomialis and A. variabilis, in total 46.94%).To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show the genetic diversity and presence of several emerging pathogenic bacteria in homeless' body lice from Algeria. We also report for the first time, the presence of several species of Acinetobacter in human body lice. Our results highlight the fact that body lice may be suspected as being a much broader vector of several pathogenic agents than previously thought. Nevertheless, other studies are needed to encourage epidemiological investigations and surveys of louse-associated infections."}

Harrison's rule, which predicts that large\u2010bodied species of hosts have large\u2010bodied species of parasites, has been documented in a wide diversity of parasites. 2. Harrison's rule has been most thoroughly studied in avian feather lice, which escape from host defence (preening) by hiding in the feathers. Lice that are unable to hide are selectively removed by preening. Preening selects for small lice on small hosts, which have small feathers in which to hide. 3. Preening should not, however, select for large lice on large hosts. Instead, the larger size of lice on large hosts is thought to result from a positive relationship between size and fecundity, as shown for many other insects. 4.

Their great importance in veterinary medicine remain significant, they can cause their direct pathogenic actions like irritability, dermatitis, anemia, decreased weight gain, and milk production. The purpose of this work was to made the first time an inventory of mammalian lice in North-eastern Algeria.Our survey of lice infestation was conducted on several animal species from five provinces of North-eastern Algeria. A total of 57 cattle, 83 sheep, 77 goats, 111 wild boars, and 63 farmyard chickens were examined. The collection of lice was carried out much more in mammals and chickens during the winter period. Lice were collected either manually or using brushing and kept in flasks containing 70% ethanol. The identification of lice was achieved in the laboratory using a binocular loupe.Concerning cattle, 63% and 27% of those examined subjects from Souk-Ahras and Guelma study areas, respectively, were carriers of lice. Damalinia bovis was the louse most frequently found on cattle in these two regions. Three other species were identified in Souk-Ahras: Haematopinus eurysternus (25%), Linognathus vituli (10%), and Solenopotes capillatus (5%). Regarding sheep, 39% and 24% of examined animals in Souk-Ahras and Guelma, were carrying lice. Damalinia ovis was the most frequently encountered lice on sheep in both regions. Linognathus ovillus also was identified in Souk-Ahras, representing 0.3% of the collected lice. Concerning goats, 53% and 30% of examined animals in Souk-Ahras and Guelma, were parasitized of lice. Two species of lice were found: Damalinia caprae and Linognathus africanus. For farmyard chickens, 69% and 100% of the farmyard chicken in Souk-Ahras and Mila were parasitized by lice, respectively. Menopon gallinae was the most frequently encountered louse in farmyard chicken in both regions. Eight other species were identified in Mila and four other species only in Souk-Ahras. Finally, 25% and 28% of the wild boars in Annaba and El Tarf were parasitized by lice, respectively. Haematopinus suis was the only species found on wild boars in both regions.These results are to be taken into account for lice control schemes and louse-borne diseases."}

Abametapir is an inhibitor of metalloproteinases critical for louse survival and egg development. The efficacy of abametapir lotion, 0.74%, was assessed for its ability to clear head louse infestations after a single application. METHODS:Two randomized, double-blind, multicenter, vehicle-controlled studies were conducted in subjects aged 6 months and older to compare the effectiveness of abametapir lotion versus vehicle control for eliminating head louse infestations without nit combing. Abametapir lotion was applied to dry hair for 10 minutes on day 0 and then rinsed with water. The primary endpoint was the proportion of index subjects (youngest household member with \u2265 3 live lice at screening) in the intent-to-treat population who were louse free at all follow-up visits through day 14. Older household members with one or more live lice at screening were designated as nonindex subjects and treated as per the index subject within their household. RESULTS:In the intent-to-treat population (index subjects, N = 216), 81.5% of subjects treated with abametapir lotion were louse free through day 14 after a single treatment, versus 49.1% with vehicle (P < 0.001). For the combined index and nonindex population (N = 704), 85.9% were louse free through day 14 in the abametapir group, versus 61.3% in the vehicle group (P < 0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events were erythema (4.0%), rash (3.2%), and skin burning sensation (2.6%). CONCLUSION:Abametapir lotion, 0.74%, was effective at clearing active head louse infestations through day 14 in subjects aged 6 months and older.

Here, ectoparasite dynamics in sympatric populations of two Malagasy mouse lemur species, Microcebus murinus and M. ravelobensis, were investigated over an 11-month period. Furthermore, the animals' body mass was determined as an indicator of body condition, reflecting seasonal and environmental challenges. Living in sympatry, the two study species experience the same environmental conditions, but show distinct differences in socioecology: Microcebus murinus sleeps in tree holes, either solitarily (males) or sometimes in groups (females only), whereas M. ravelobensis sleeps in mixed-sex groups in more open vegetation. RESULTS:Both mouse lemur species hosted ticks (Haemaphysalis sp.), lice (Lemurpediculus sp.) and mites (Trombiculidae gen. sp. and Laelaptidae gen. sp.). Host species, as well as temporal variations (month and year), were identified as the main factors influencing infestation. Tick infestation peaked in the late dry season and was significantly more often observed in M. murinus (P = 0.011), while lice infestation was more likely in M. ravelobensis (P < 0.001) and showed a continuous increase over the course of the dry season. Genetic analyses identified Lemurpediculus sp. infesting both mouse lemur species. Ticks morphologically conform to H. lemuris, but genetic analysis showed a clear differentiation of the specimens collected in this study, suggesting a potentially new tick species. Host body mass decreased from the early to the late dry season, indicating nutritional stress during this period, which may render individuals more susceptible to parasitic infections. CONCLUSIONS:Seasonal differences and species-specific variations in sleeping site ecology in terms of sleeping site type and sociality were determined as key factors influencing ectoparasitism in M. murinus and M. ravelobensis. This needs to be taken into account when evaluating ectoparasite infestations at a given time point. The detection of the same parasite species on two closely related and sympatric host species furthermore indicates a potential pathway for disease transmission, not only within but also between lemur species."}

Infestations of sea lice on farms significantly increase opportunities for the parasite to spread in the surrounding ecosystem, making control of this pest a challenging issue for salmon producers. The complexity of controlling sea lice on salmon farms requires frequent monitoring of the abundance of different sea lice stages over time. Industry-based data sets of counts of lice are amenable to multivariate time-series data analyses. In this study, two sets of multivariate autoregressive state-space models were applied to Chilean sea lice data from six Atlantic salmon production cycles on five isolated farms (at least 20\u202fkm seaway distance away from other known active farms), to evaluate the utility of these models for predicting sea lice abundance over time on farms. The models were constructed with different parameter configurations, and the analysis demonstrated large heterogeneity between production cycles for the autoregressive parameter, the effects of chemotherapeutant bath treatments, and the process-error variance. A model allowing for different parameters across production cycles had the best fit and the smallest overall prediction errors. However, pooling information across cycles for the drift and observation error parameters did not substantially affect model performance, thus reducing the number of necessary parameters in the model. Bath treatments had strong but variable effects for reducing sea lice burdens, and these effects were stronger for adult lice than juvenile lice. Our multivariate state-space models were able to handle different sea lice stages and provide predictions for sea lice abundance with reasonable accuracy up to five weeks out."}

The sound transducers were operated at maximum power levels, and the 9.3 kHz transducer generated the highest sound level (220.6 dB). Only the group exposed to 9.3 kHz displayed a significant reduction in louse infestation. However, the observed effect of ultrasound was relatively small, and in a practical implementation in sea cages, the sound intensity will be lower than that used in the experiments. It is also possible that the observed reduction in infestation is due to ultrasonic cavitation effects, which are only present at a very short range from the ultrasound source. We therefore do not consider ultrasound a feasible method for preventing attachment of salmon lice copepodids on salmon in cage farms."}

Attempts have been made to eradicate head lice Pediculus humanus capitis by hot air, soaking in various fluids or asphyxiation using occlusive treatments. In this study, we assessed the maximum time that head lice can survive anoxia (oxygen deprivation) and their ability to survive prolonged water immersion. We also observed the ingress of fluids across louse tracheae and spiracle characteristics contrasting with those described in the literature. We showed that 100% of lice can withstand 8\u2009h of anoxia and 12.2% survived 14\u2009h of anoxia; survival was 48.9% in the untreated control group at 14\u2009h. However, all lice had died following 16\u2009h of anoxia. In contrast, the survival rate of water-immersed lice was significantly higher when compared with non-immersed lice after 6\u2009h (100% vs. 76.6%, p\u2009=\u20090.0037), and 24\u2009h (50.9% vs. 15.9%, p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Although water-immersed lice did not close their spiracles, water did not penetrate into the respiratory system. In contrast, immersion in colored dimeticone/cyclomethicone or colored ethanol resulted in penetration through the spiracles and spreading to the entire respiratory system within 30\u2009min, leading to death in 100% of the lice."}

In particular, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are sequences with low coding potential and conservation among species. Moreover, cumulative evidence has revealed important roles in post-transcriptional gene modulation in several taxa. In fish, the role of lncRNAs has been scarcely studied and even less so during the immune response against sea lice. In the present study we mined for lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and Coho salmon (Oncorhynkus kisutch), which are affected by the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi, evaluating the degree of sequence conservation between these two fish species and their putative roles during the infection process. Herein, Atlantic and Coho salmon were infected with 35 lice/fish and evaluated after 7 and 14 days post-infestation (dpi). For RNA sequencing, samples from skin and head kidney were collected. A total of 5658/4140 and 3678/2123 lncRNAs were identified in uninfected/infected Atlantic and Coho salmon transcriptomes, respectively. Species-specific transcription patterns were observed in exclusive lncRNAs according to the tissue analyzed. Furthermore, neighbor gene GO enrichment analysis of the top 100 highly regulated lncRNAs in Atlantic salmon showed that lncRNAs were localized near genes related to the immune response. On the other hand, in Coho salmon the highly regulated lncRNAs were localized near genes involved in tissue repair processes. This study revealed high regulation of lncRNAs closely localized to immune and tissue repair-related genes in Atlantic and Coho salmon, respectively, suggesting putative roles for lncRNAs in salmon against sea lice infestation."}

With shelters in Houston at capacity, residents from adjacent affected regions were evacuated elsewhere, and Dallas received over 3,800 evacuees at a single convention center shelter. Approaches to infectious disease surveillance and prevention in this mega-shelter setting were assessed and refined during the response.MethodsTeams of epidemiologists and medical students reviewed all clinical records daily from the on-site, 24/7 walk-in medical clinic, which was staffed by local volunteer physicians. Demographic data, chief complaints, and diagnosis for each patient visit were reviewed, and daily aggregate summaries of visits for potential communicable disease symptoms were compiled. An additional infection control team consisting of health department staff and volunteer hospital infection preventionists implemented aggressive infection prevention measures in the shelter and clinic.ResultsOf the evacuees registered at this mass-scale shelter, 92% were from counties outside of Houston and 36% were 18 years of age or younger. During the shelter\u2019s 23 days of operation, the shelter medical clinic received a cumulative volume of 2,654 clinic visits from 1,560 evacuees. The most common reasons for clinic visits included: need for medication refills (27.2%); respiratory symptoms (18.8%); and skin-related complaints (8.6%). Isolated cases of scabies, lice, norovirus, and influenza were confirmed, with no outbreak transmission of communicable diseases reported in the shelter.ConclusionThe need for acute-care medical services and resources at a central shelter location was highlighted by the high proportion (40%) of evacuees seeking care at least once at the shelter medical clinic. The 24/7 accessibility of this on-site medical clinic to evacuees additionally provided a reliable mechanism for daily syndromic surveillance for potential outbreaks of infectious disease in a large shelter. Given the challenges of mass-sheltering and provision of clinical care in non-residential structures, dedicated staffing with infection control expertise was critical in this shelter setting.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures."}

Two species are currently being farmed in North Atlantic countries, ballan wrasse (Labrus bergylta) and lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus), and the sector in most countries is rapidly expanding towards self-sufficiency. The species are very different both in terms of their biology and life histories and, consequently, production and husbandry methods must be tailored to each species. There are numerous health challenges currently experienced in both species, with bacterial and parasitic diseases being the most prevalent, and cohabitation with salmon may increase the risk of disease. Good husbandry and routine health monitoring are essential, although treatment is often required when disease outbreaks occur. Ballan wrasse and lumpfish are both proven to be effective salmon delousers, although delousing efficacy can be variable in farmed fish; the provision of suitable habitat and acclimation to net-pen conditions may encourage natural behaviours, including delousing, and the use of operational welfare indicators can highlight potential welfare issues. Cleaner fish research is progressing rapidly, although much of the basic knowledge regarding the species' biology remains unknown. The simultaneous domestication of two new marine aquaculture species is a significant challenge demanding sustained effort and funding over a prolonged period of time. Research must focus on enhancing the robustness of the farmed stocks and increasing hatchery outputs to meet the urgent demands from the salmon sector and protect wild stocks from overfishing."}

Phylogenetically, they belong to several mitochondrial clades exhibiting some geographic differences. Currently, the body louse is the only recognized disease vector, with the head louse being proposed as an additional vector. In this article, we study the genetic diversity of head and body lice collected from Bobigny, a town located close to Paris (France), and look for louse-borne pathogens. By amplifying and sequencing the cytb gene, we confirmed the presence of clades A and B in France. Besides, by amplifying and sequencing both cytb and cox1 gene, we reported, for the first time, the presence of clade E, which has thus far only been found in lice from West Africa. DNA from Bartonella quintana was detected in 16.7% of body lice from homeless individuals, but in none of the head lice collected from 47 families. Acinetobacter DNA was detected in 11.5% of head lice belonging to all three clades and 29.1% of body lice. Six species of Acinetobacter were identified, including two potential new ones. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent, followed by Candidatus Acinetobacter Bobigny-1, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter nosocomialis, Acinetobacter junii, and Candidatus Acinetobacter Bobigny-2. Body lice were found to be infected only with A. baumannii. These findings show for the first time, the presence of clade E head lice in France. This study is also the first to report the presence of DNAs of several species of Acinetobacter in human head lice in France."}

As shown in the present study, the viruses have limited effect on louse survival, developmental rate and fecundity. Since the LsRVs were confirmed to be present in the louse salivary glands, the salmon cutaneous immune response towards LsRV positive and negative lice was analyzed. In general, L.\u00a0salmonis increased the expression of IL1\u03b2, IL8 and IL4/13A\u202fat the attachment site, in addition to the non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1 (NCCRP-1). Interestingly, LsRV free lice induced a higher skin expression of IL1\u03b2, IL8, and NCCRP-1 than the LsRV infected lice. The inflammatory response is important for louse clearance, and the present results suggest that the LsRVs can be beneficial for the louse by dampening inflammation. Further research is, however; needed to ascertain whether this is a direct modulatory effect of secreted virions, or if virus replication is altering the level of louse salivary gland proteins."}

The decline in EMB treatment efficacy for this purpose is an important issue for salmon producers around the world, and particularly for those in the Atlantic Ocean where widespread EMB tolerance in sea lice is recognized as a significant problem. Salmon farms in the Northeast Pacific Ocean have not historically experienced the same issues with treatment efficacy, possibly due to the relatively large population of endemic salmonid hosts that serve to both redistribute surviving lice and dilute populations potentially under selection by introducing na\u00efve lice to farms. Frequent migration of lice among farmed and wild hosts should limit the effect of farm-specific selection pressures on changes to the overall allele frequencies of sea lice in the Pacific Ocean. A previous study using microsatellites examined L. salmonis oncorhynchi from 10 Pacific locations from wild and farmed hosts and found no population structure. Recently however, a farm population of sea lice was detected where EMB bioassay exposure tolerance was abnormally elevated. In response, we have developed a Pacific louse draft genome that complements the previously-released Atlantic louse sequence. These genomes were combined with whole-genome re-sequencing data to design a highly sensitive 201,279 marker SNP array applicable for both subspecies (90,827 validated Pacific loci; 153,569 validated Atlantic loci). Notably, kmer spectrum analysis of the re-sequenced samples indicated that Pacific lice exhibit a large within-individual heterozygosity rate (average of 1 in every 72 bases) that is markedly higher than that of Atlantic individuals (1 in every 173 bases). The SNP chip was used to produce a high-density map for Atlantic sea louse linkage group 5 that was previously shown to be associated with EMB tolerance in Atlantic lice. Additionally, 478 Pacific louse samples from farmed and wild hosts obtained between 2005 and 2014 were also genotyped on the array. Clustering analysis allowed us to detect the apparent emergence of an otherwise rare genotype at a high frequency among the lice collected from two farms in 2013 that had reported elevated EMB tolerance. This genotype was not observed in louse samples collected from the same farm in 2010, nor in any lice sampled from other locations prior to 2013. However, this genotype was detected at low frequencies in louse samples from farms in two locations reporting elevated EMB tolerance in 2014. These results suggest that a rare genotype present in Pacific lice may be locally expanded in farms after EMB treatment. Supporting this hypothesis, 437 SNPs associated with this genotype were found to be in a region of linkage group 5 that overlaps the region associated with EMB resistance in Atlantic lice. Finally, five of the top diagnostic SNPs within this region were used to screen lice that had been subjected to an EMB survival assay, revealing a significant association between these SNPs and EMB treatment outcome. To our knowledge this work is the first report to identify a genetic link to altered EMB efficacy in L. salmonis in the Pacific Ocean."}

Bark lice (Psocodea) are known to possess a unique wing-to-wing repose coupling system, but a detailed morphological and evolutionary study of this system is lacking. In this study, we examined this repose coupling structure by SEM in 32 species including representatives of all three suborders of bark lice (Trogiomorpha, Troctomorpha and Psocomorpha). We concluded that the repose wing-coupling apparatus independently evolved twice within Psocodea. In Trogiomorpha, the apparatus is located on the subcostal vein of the forewing and is composed of elongated rib-like structures. In Troctomorpha and Psocomorpha, in contrast, the repose coupling structure is located on the radius vein of the forewing and is formed by a swollen vein. These morphological and developmental differences in the repose coupling structures also provide phylogenetic information at different systematic levels."}

In the present study, a full-length L. salmonis lipophorin receptor (LsLpR) consisting of 16 exons was obtained by RACE and RT-PCR. The predicted ORF was 952 amino acids and structural analysis showed five functional domains that are similar to LpR of insects and decapods. Phylogenetic analysis placed the LsLpR together with LpRs from decapods and insects. Expression analysis revealed that the relative abundance of LsLpR transcripts was highest in the larvae and adult female lice. In adult females, the LsLpR transcripts and protein were found in the ovary and vitellogenic oocytes whereas, in larvae, the LsLpR transcripts were found in the neuronal somata of the brain and the intestine. Oil Red O stain results revealed that storage of neutral lipids was found in vitellogenic oocytes and ovaries of adult females, and in the yolk of larvae. Moreover, RNA interference (RNAi) was conducted to demonstrate the function of LsLpR in reproduction and lipid metabolism in L. salmonis. In larvae, the transcription of LsLpR was decreased by 44-54% while in an experiment LsLpR knockdown female lice produced 72% less offspring than control lice."}

Mortality and prevalence of deformities, pharmacokinetics, oxidative stress and transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling were used to assess the response to teflubenzuron exposure. Mortality in the high-dose group was 25% (five of 20 individuals). No control or low-dose group shrimps died. Phenotypic responses,i.e., leg deformities (0 control, 6 low, 8 high) and cloudy eyes (0 control, 3 low, 7 high), were observed in some surviving shrimps (control n\u00a0=\u00a015, low n\u00a0=\u00a017, high n\u00a0=\u00a015).

Transcriptomic profiling showed very few significantly altered genes in the exposed shrimps. Teflubenzuron-induced changes to the metabolome pointed to well-known effects of benzoylurea agents, with reduced levels of N-acetylglucosamine indicating an effect on chitin synthesis. The metabolomic profiling showed that teflubenzuron exposure was associated with reduced energy metabolism. Some metabolites pointed to increased necrosis and/or bacterial overgrowth in the teflubenzuron-exposed shrimps.

Delousing side effects can lead to poor welfare outcomes for fish, however reducing lice abundance in farms is crucial to reduce their ecological impacts. To determine which delousing treatments causes the highest salmon mortality, we used national-level databases to compare mortality for all delousing treatments (i.e. in-feed, bath, well-boat based, cage-based, thermal and mechanical treatments) used from 2012 to 2015 in Norway. As hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is one of the riskiest delousing treatments with high mortality levels, we determined how hydrogen peroxide concentration (0, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2 and 2.25gL\u22121) for 20min at 10\u00b0C influenced post-smolt salmon mortality and mucous cells, pre-adult lice attachment, and the re-infection success of lice copepodids. H2O2 concentration strongly affected salmon mortality, but did not alter mucous cell area or density, pre-adult lice removal efficiency, or the re-infection success of lice copepodids. We recorded salmon mortality of 0% at 1gL\u22121, 18% at 1.5gL\u22121 and 100% at 2.25gL\u22121. Further, previous exposure to lice had no effect on salmon welfare or the likelihood of re-infection, as salmon mortality and copepodid infection success did not differ for salmon infected with lice and treated, or salmon not infected with lice and treated. We found discrepancies in salmon mortality between our experiment and industry observed mortality, with higher mortalities observed in our experiment compared to the industry. This is most likely due to the overestimation of water volume during in-cage treatments at farms, and also less organic matter present during our experiment. As we found no difference in lice removal efficacies between 1 and 2gL\u22121 and salmon mortality was high at concentrations of 1.5gL\u22121 upwards, we do not recommend increasing H2O2 dosage during treatment as a form of combatting H2O2 resistance in lice."}

Our analyses indicated a significant positive association between the sea lice abundance on farms and the likelihood that wild fish would be infested. However, increased abundance of lice on farms was not significantly associated with the levels of infestation observed on the wild salmon. Our results suggest that Atlantic salmon farms may be an important source for the introduction of sea lice to wild Pacific salmon populations, but that the absence of a dose response relationship indicates that any estimate of farm impact requires more careful evaluation of causal inference than is typically seen in the extant scientific literature."}

Monthly parasite abundance was significantly correlated with the density of sea lice larvae (nauplius and copepodid stages) (r2=0.65, p=0.01) suspended in the water column of the salmon pens. Larval density was calculated monthly via triplicate vertical plankton hauls within six pens, as well as at a reference site approximately 150m away. Larval density at the farm peaked in January 2013 (mean\u00b1SE: 1.3\u00b10.6indm\u22123) and January 2014 (1.0\u00b10.3indm\u22123). Sea lice nauplii were found in all samples at the reference site in densities similar to those observed within pens. Overall, the majority (87.8%) of sea lice in the plankton samples were nauplii, with copepodids comprising 5.2% and motile stages 1.8%. Surprisingly, the remaining 5.2% of planktonic sea lice were chalimus stages of C. clemensi, and were found both before and after SLICE\u00ae administration. For comparison, L. salmonis nauplius densities were estimated from established relationships between water temperature and salinity, the number of female lice present, and the approximate number of fish on site. These estimated densities were significantly (t=3.41, p=0.009) higher than actual nauplius densities observed at the farm, suggesting that sea lice larvae quickly dispersed from the farm after hatching. This study provides information on all sea lice stages present throughout an Atlantic salmon production cycle in BC (through two SLICE\u00ae treatments) and the first report of planktonic chalimus stages of C. clemensi, a commercially-relevant though relatively under-studied sea louse species."}

The volatiles were collected by means of Solid Phase microextraction and the extract obtained was chemically analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Twenty-four volatile were identified in the human scalp odor, with the main compounds being the following: nonanal, sulcatone, geranylacetone, and palmitic acid. Head lice were highly attracted by the blend human scalp volatiles, as well as by the individual major components. A significant finding of our study was to demonstrate that nonanal activity depends on the mass of the compound as it is repellent at high concentrations and an attractant at low concentrations. The results of this study indicate that head lice may use chemical signals in addition to other mechanisms to remain on the host."}

Multiple resistance has been described across most available compound classes with the exception of the benzoylureas. To target this gap in effective management of L. salmonis and other species of sea lice (e.g. Caligus spp.), Elanco Animal Health is developing an in-feed treatment containing lufenuron (a benzoylurea) to be administered prior to seawater transfer of salmon smolts and to provide long-term protection of salmon against sea lice infestations. Benzoylureas disrupt chitin synthesis, formation, and deposition during all moulting events. However, the mechanism(s) of action are not yet fully understood and most research completed to date has focused on insects. We exposed the first parasitic stage of L. salmonis to 700\u202fppb lufenuron for three hours and observed over 90% reduction in survival to the chalimus II life stage on the host, as compared to vehicle controls. This agrees with a follow up in vivo administration study on the host, which showed >95% reduction by the chalimus I stage. Transcriptomic responses of salmon lice exposed to lufenuron included genes related to moulting, epithelial differentiation, solute transport, and general developmental processes. Global metabolite profiles also suggest that membrane stability and fluidity is impacted in treated lice. These molecular signals are likely the underpinnings of an abnormal moulting process and cuticle formation observed ultrastructurally using transmission electron microscopy. Treated nauplii-staged lice exhibited multiple abnormalities in the integument, suggesting that the coordinated assembly of the epi- and procuticle is impaired. In all cases, treatment with lufenuron had rapid impacts on L. salmonis development. We describe multiple experiments to characterize the efficacy of lufenuron on eggs, larvae, and parasitic stages of L. salmonis, and provide the most comprehensive assessment of the physiological responses of a marine arthropod to a benzoylurea chemical."}

The anaesthetic impact from salinity (15 ppt-18 ppt), temperature (12\u00b0C versus 7 and 18\u00b0C), and fasting conditions (three days) was also examined. Surgical anaesthesia was induced within 3 to 5 min (preferred time) at concentrations of 18 mg/L (Aqui-S), 37.5 mg/L (Benzoak), and 60 mg/L (buffered MS-222). Safety margins were regarded as low when using Aqui-S; therefore, this chemical was not considered suitable for prolonged exposures. The lumpfish made a rapid recovery from both Benzoak and MS-222 even after 20 min of exposure. A 6\u00b0C increase in exposure temperature (reaching 18\u00b0C) was found to delay or inhibit recovery. The effect of a 5\u00b0C decrease (down to 7\u00b0C) significantly reduced induction time for MS-222 and was insignificant for Aqui-S, while it prolonged Benzoak induction time significantly and gave a longer recovery period. Fasting resulted in 70% recovery after 20 min of Aqui-S exposure compared to 0% in fed fish but had only minor effects on Benzoak and MS-222. Use of brackish water (15 ppt-18 ppt) gave 20% recovery from Aqui-S and significantly shorter recovery time from MS-222 exposure, while the effects on Benzoak were insignificant."}

Due to development of resistance towards available chemotherapeutants, it is clear that new chemotherapeutants or non-chemical control methods are essential to manage the parasite in the future. The TOR signaling pathway is present in all metazoans and is a major regulator of cellular activity according to nutrient availability. In this study, we identified the TOR pathway genes in salmon louse; LsTSC1, LsTSC2, LsRheb, LsTOR, LsRaptor and LsRictor. RNA interference mediated gene silencing was performed to elucidate the functional role of each member of the pathway. Our results show that interference of the TOR signaling pathway either directly or indirectly inhibits many biological processes including egg maturation. In addition, the effect of gene knock-down results in more comprehensive physiological defects when targeting TORC1 and the upstream regulator Rheb. This is the first report on the TOR pathway in the salmon louse and that our research contributes to the basic knowledge of the parasite that could lead to development of novel treatment methods."}

Lice of four stages divided into up to four age groups within the stage were analysed in triplicate (total of 66 samples).

The most prevalent shielding technique is fitting a skirt around the upper part of the cage. However, limited scientific data is available on the effects skirts have on lice levels, water quality and fish welfare. The present study compares lice infestation levels on farmed Atlantic salmon, oxygen saturation levels and fish welfare scores between cages with and without 10 m deep skirts from May to September at a commercial farm. The effectiveness of skirts at reducing lice infestations varied during the observation period, but at the last sampling 80% less lice were found on the fish in skirt cages compared to in standard cages. From early July and onwards, oxygen levels inside the skirts were reduced by 5 to 35 percentage points saturation compared to standard cages. However, the lowest oxygen value registered was still above 70% oxygen saturation. No differences in fish welfare scores and mortality between treatments were observed. Under the presented conditions, we therefore conclude that the skirts effectively reduced lice levels while preserving oxygen levels and fish welfare. More studies are, however, needed to reveal how the effects from skirts change with season and site."}

Synchronization of antiparasitic treatments among closely located salmon farms has been recently evaluated as a promising strategy for improving treatment performance. However, the optimum distance at which farms should synchronize their treatments is not clear. We used a repeated measures linear mixed effects model to evaluate the impact of two nationwide treatment synchronization procedures conducted in Chile in 2014 and 2015 on subsequent adult lice counts up to 13\u00c2\u00a0weeks after the procedure. Each treatment synchronization procedure consisted of two 2\u00e2\u0080\u0090week synchronization windows, in which farms were required to treat their fish. A period of 3\u00c2\u00a0weeks elapsed between the two windows. Treatment synchronization was measured as the number of neighbouring farms that treated their fish within a certain geographical threshold, each of them weighted by its distance from the farm of interest. We tested four different thresholds: 5, 10, 20 and 30\u00c2\u00a0km. The results indicate that the abundance of adult lice on farms that synchronized treatments with their neighbours within a distance of 5\u00c2\u00a0km was lower than the abundance on non\u00e2\u0080\u0090synchronized farms from weeks 4 to 11 after the procedure.

One such method is the use of cleaner fish to remove the lice from the salmon. A cleaner fish that has recently gained in popularity due to its ability to work in cold water, is the lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus). This fish varies in efficiency, but when mortality is low and cleaning optimal, the fish are successful in keeping parasite burdens low. However, there is some concern for the welfare of lumpfish in the industry, because mortality is often high. This is sometimes attributed to inadequate feeding and shelter. Here we compare growth, body condition, and fin health of fish reared for four weeks in a crossed treatment design crossing shelter availability (shelter vs none) and feed delivery method (manual meal time feeds and continuous automated feeding). In terms of weight gain, shelter availability interacted with feeding method, with fish that had access to shelters and were fed using automated feeders gaining less weight than other fish. Fin health was not affected, but body condition was lowered both by access to shelter and being fed continuously. The results indicate a need to carefully consider how feeding method and shelter use is combined, both in cages and during rearing on land."}

The aim of this study was to assess and analyse peer-reviewed literature on EPSD in humans. The results of this study serve as an indicator of the extent the scientific community, health authorities, and international health agencies interact with EPSD as a health problem that is commonly associated with poverty and poor hygiene. METHODS:A bibliometric analysis methodology was used. The Scopus database was used to retrieve documents about EPSD for the study period (1967-2017). The study focused on scabies, tungiasis, pediculosis, hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans (HrCLM), myiasis, and cutaneous strongyloidiasis. Documents that specifically and explicitly discuss EPSD in animals, aquatic organisms, and birds were excluded. RESULTS:In total, 4186 documents were retrieved. A fluctuated growth of publications on EPSD in the past five decades was found. The retrieved documents received 43\u2009301 citations, an average of 10.3 citations per article and an h-index of 74. The keywords \"scabies\" and was the most commonly encountered keyword followed by the keywords \"head lice\" and \"pediculosis\". The most active journal involved in publishing articles on EPSD was the International Journal of Dermatology (164; 3.9%). Researchers from 93 different countries published the retrieved articles. The USA led with 735 (17.6%) documents, followed by the UK (274; 6.5%), and Germany (259; 6.2%). In terms of institutions, the Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin in Germany was the most active in this field with 78 (1.9%) publications, followed by the Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1 in Brazil with 52 (1.2%) publications. CONCLUSIONS:Research on scabies and pediculosis dominated the field of EPSD research to the expense of tungiasis, HrCLM, myiasis, and cutaneous strongyloidiasis. There was an underrepresentation of literature from the tropics and subtropics despite EPSD being common in these areas. This could possibly be explained by the presence of limited number of non-English journals in the Scopus database. International research collaborations and research networking should be strengthened to help advance and prioritize research on EPSD."}

We tested whether introducing no-farming areas or 'firebreaks' could disconnect dispersal networks of a parasitic disease affecting the world's largest marine fish farming industry (\u223c1000 farms). Larval salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are released from and transported among salmon farms by ocean currents, creating inter-farm networks of louse dispersal. We used a state-of-the-art biophysical model to predict louse movement along the Norwegian coastline and network analysis to identify firebreaks to dispersal. At least one firebreak that fragmented the network into two large unconnected groups of farms was identified for all seasons. During spring, when wild salmon migrate out into the ocean, and louse levels per fish at farms must be minimised, two effective firebreaks were created by removing 13 and 21 farms (1.3% and 2.2% of all farms in the system) at \u223c61\u00b0N and 67\u00b0N, respectively. We have demonstrated that dispersal models coupled with network analysis can identify no-farming zones that fragment dispersal networks. Reduced dispersal pathways should lower infection pressure at farms, slow the evolution of resistance to parasite control measures, and alleviate infection pressure on wild salmon populations."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Sea lice infestations causes major economic losses in the Atlantic salmon aquaculture industry, and cleaner fish, e.g. the lumpfish, Cyclopterus lumpus L., are therefore increasingly deployed as a biological control method. However, large variations in the cleaning efficacy have been observed, and in the Faroe Islands, the most prominent variation is seasonal. Over a period of approximately two years 5511 lumpfish stomachs were analysed. The stomach contents, where present, were identified and grouped as, a) sea lice, b) lumpfish feed, c) salmon feed, d) organisms associated with biofouling, e) zooplankton organisms and/or f) other. The presence of zooplankton organisms had a significant, and negative, influence on the cleaning efficacy, while the presence of organisms associated with biofouling had a more moderate, but positive, influence on the prevalence of sea lice in the lumpfish diet. Our findings indicate that biofouling, and the subsequent availability of alternative prey organisms, does not reduce the cleaning efficacy of lumpfish, while zooplankton does, i.e. reducing it by a factor of approximately five. The lumpfish size only seemed to play a minor role in the variation observed in the cleaning efficacy, while it had a significant influence on the proportion of empty stomachs, i.e. the smaller lumpfish (< 50 g) had the highest occurrence of empty stomachs.This is convenient knowledge for implementation in the sea lice strategies of farming sites using lumpfish as cleaner fish in general, but especially in farming areas with large seasonal variations in the zooplankton abundance such as in the Faroes. The high occurrence of empty stomachs in small lumpfish highlights the necessity to adapt husbandry in the first period post lumpfish deployment, especially when the opportunity for naturally occurring food is sparse. Furthermore, our findings of biofouling having a positive influence on the grazing efficacy of lumpfish indicate that net cleaning might have a negative influence on lumpfish grazing efficacy."}

We genotyped lice sampled from wild salmon and sea trout throughout Norway with the recently identified Phe362Tyr mutation that conveys resistance to organophosphates. These results were compared to data from lice sampled on farmed salmon in the same regions. The resistant (R) allele was observed in salmon lice from wild salmon and sea trout throughout Norway, although its frequency was highest in farming-intense regions. In most regions, the frequency of the R allele was higher in lice collected from wild sea trout than wild Atlantic salmon, and in all regions, the frequency of the R allele was similar in lice collected from wild sea trout and farmed Atlantic salmon. The R allele is only selected for in fish-farms where organophosphates are used for delousing. Therefore, our results suggest extensive exchange of lice between farmed and wild hosts, and indicate that in farming-dense regions in Norway, aquaculture represents a major driver of salmon louse population structure. Finally, these data suggest that the wild hosts within the regions studied will not delay the spread of resistance when organophosphates are used."}

Herein, we examine the genetic consequences of range expansion over a 25-year period in a parasite (Geomydoecus aurei) that is in the process of expanding its geographic range via invasion of a novel host. By sampling the genetics of 1,935 G.\u00a0aurei lice taken from 64 host individuals collected over this time period using 12 microsatellite markers, we test hypotheses concerning linear spatial expansion, genetic recovery time and allele surfing. We find evidence of decreasing allelic richness (AR) with increasing distance from the source population, supporting a linear, stepping stone model of spatial expansion that emphasizes the effects of repeated bottleneck events during colonization. We provide evidence of post-bottleneck genetic recovery, with average AR of infrapopulations increasing about 30% over the 225-generation span of time observed directly in this study. Our estimates of recovery rate suggest, however, that recovery has plateaued and that this population may not reach genetic diversity levels of the source population without further immigration from the source population. Finally, we employ a grid-based sampling scheme in the region of ongoing population expansion and provide empirical evidence for the power of allele surfing to impart genetic structure on a population, even under conditions of selective neutrality and in a place that lacks strong barriers to gene flow."}

Previous studies showed the potential of selective breeding to increase n-3 LC-PUFA levels in salmon tissues, but knowledge on the genetic parameters for individual muscle fatty acids (FA) and their relationships with other traits is still lacking. Thus, we estimated genetic parameters for muscle content of individual FA, and their relationships with lipid deposition traits, muscle pigmentation, sea lice and pancreas disease in slaughter-sized Atlantic salmon. Our aim was to evaluate the selection potential for increased n-3 LC-PUFA content and provide insight into FA metabolism in Atlantic salmon muscle. RESULTS:Among the n-3 PUFA, proportional contents of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3) and DHA had the highest heritability (0.26) and EPA the lowest (0.09). Genetic correlations of EPA and DHA proportions with muscle fat differed considerably, 0.60 and 0.01, respectively. The genetic correlation of DHA proportion with visceral fat was positive and high (0.61), whereas that of EPA proportion with lice density was negative. FA that are in close proximity along the bioconversion pathway showed positive correlations with each other, whereas the start (ALA) and end-point (DHA) of the pathway were negatively correlated (-\u20090.28), indicating active bioconversion of ALA to DHA in the muscle of fish fed high FO-diet. CONCLUSIONS:Since contents of individual FA in salmon muscle show additive genetic variation, changing FA composition by selective breeding is possible. Taken together, our results show that the heritabilities of individual n-3 LC-PUFA and their genetic correlations with other traits vary, which indicates that they play different roles in muscle lipid metabolism, and that proportional muscle contents of EPA and DHA are linked to body fat deposition. Thus, different selection strategies can be applied in order to increase the content of healthy omega-3 FAin the salmon muscle. We recommend selection for the proportion of EPA\u2009+\u2009DHA in the muscle because they are both essential FA and because such selection has no clear detrimental effects on other traits."}

To confirm the roles of these genes in induction and tolerance, the robust genetic model insect Drosophila melanogaster was chosen. Orthologous genes corresponding to the body louse P450 (Cyp9f2, Cyp6g2 and Cyp9h1) and ABC transporter (Mrp1, GC1824 as an ABCB type and CG3327 as an ABCG type) genes were selected for in vivo bioassay. Following a brief treatment with a sublethal dose of ivermectin, the mortality response was significantly slower, indicating the presence of tolerance. Concurrently, the transcription levels of Cyp9f2 and Mrp1 at 3 h and those of Cyp6g2, Cyp9h1, Mrp1, CG1824 and CG3327 at 6 h post-treatment were upregulated, indicating gene induction. In behavioural bioassay using GAL4/UAS-RNA interference transgenic fly lines, increased susceptibility to ivermectin was observed following heat shock in the Cyp9f2 , Cyp6g2 , Cyp9h1 , Mrp1 or CG3327-knockdown flies. Considering that these five genes are orthologous to those which had the largest over-expression level following ivermectin-induced tolerance in the body louse, the current results suggest that they are also associated with ivermectin detoxification in D. melanogaster and that body lice and D. melanogaster are likely to share, in part, similar mechanisms of tolerance to ivermectin."}

Both ecotypes of Pediculus humanus (Phthiraptera: Pediculidae), the human head and body lice, are human ectoparasites, the control of which is challenged by the recent spread of resistance alleles. The present study conclusively establishes for the first time that both head and body lice reproduce through paternal genome elimination (PGE), an unusual genetic system in which males transmit only their maternally derived chromosomes. Here, we investigate inheritance patterns of parental genomes using a genotyping approach across families of both ecotypes and show that heterozygous males exclusively or preferentially pass on one allele only, whereas females transmit both in a Mendelian fashion. We do however observe occasional transmission of paternal chromosomes through males, representing the first known case of PGE in which whole-genome meiotic drive is incomplete. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this finding for the evolution of resistance and invite the development of new theoretical models of how this knowledge might contribute to increasing the success of pediculicide-based management schemes."}

In L. salmonis; however, we have limited knowledge about the exocrine glands.

LsFNII1, 2 and 3 contains four, three, and two FNII domains respectively. Sequence alignment of LsFNII domains showed conservation of amino acids that may indicate a possible involvement of LsFNII domains in collagen binding. Ontogenetic analysis of LsFNII1, 2 and 3 revealed highest expression in pre-adult and adult lice. Localization of LsFNII1, 2 and 3 transcripts showed expression in teg 1 glands only, which are the most abundant exocrine gland type in L. salmonis. LsFNII1, 2 and 3 were successfully knocked-down by RNAi, however, alteration in gland morphology was not detected between the knock-down and control groups.

At sea, individuals typically are subject to sea lice infestation, which can have detrimental effects on their host. Over recent decades, the body condition and marine survival in NE Atlantic stocks have generally decreased, reflected in fewer adults returning to rivers, which is partly attributable to sea lice. We developed a deterministic stage-structured population model to assess condition-mediated population dynamics resulting in changing fecundity, age at sexual maturation and marine survival rate. The model is parameterized using data from the North Esk system, north-east Scotland. Both constant and density-dependent juvenile survival rates are considered. We show that even small sea lice-mediated changes in mean body condition of MSW can cause substantial population declines, whereas 1SW condition is less influential. Density dependence alleviates the condition-mediated population effect. The resilience of the population to demographic perturbations declines as adult condition is reduced. Indirect demographic changes in salmonid life-history traits (e.g., body condition) are often considered unimportant for population trajectory. The model shows that Atlantic salmon population dynamics can be highly responsive to sea lice-mediated effects on adult body condition, thus highlighting the importance of non-lethal parasitic long-term effects."}

Head lice, Pediculus humanus capitis, have a short life, feed only on human blood and do not transmit pathogens to their progeny. They are, therefore, a perfect tool for the xenodiagnosis of current or recent human infection. This study assessed the occurrence of bacterial pathogens from head lice collected in two rural villages from Mali, where a high frequency of head lice infestation had previously been reported, using molecular methods. Results show that all 600 head lice, collected from 117 individuals, belonged to clade E, specific to West Africa. Bartonella quintana, the causative agent of trench fever, was identified in three of the 600 (0.5%) head lice studied. Our study also shows, for the first time, the presence of the DNA of two pathogenic bacteria, namely Coxiella burnetii (5.1%) and Rickettsia aeschlimannii (0.6%), detected in human head lice, as well as the DNA of potential new species from the Anaplasma and Ehrlichia genera of unknown pathogenicity.

It is widely spread in aquaculture facilities and leads to economic losses every year. As it has developed resistances against many common treatments, new control methods must be established. Here we characterize a novel gene family of the salmon louse, consisting of two genes, which has not been described in other species before. We analyzed temporal expression patterns of both genes, the localization of mRNA and protein. An RNAi mediated gene knockdown lead to information about the function of the protein. Overall, these two genes are expressed only in sperm ducts of male sea lice. The mucin-like proteins can additionally be found in the wall of spermatophores, which are responsible for sperm transfer to females. Knockdown showed that both genes are essential for successful fertilization of females. Overall, all results indicate that the two analyzed genes are necessary for reproduction in sea lice as they are essential for the formation of a wall surrounding the spermatophores, which is needed for fertilization. Therefore, we name them Mucin-like spermatophore wall protein 1 & 2 (MLSWP1 & MLSWP2).

We tagged 310 wild sea trout during 3\u00a0years, and gave half of the individuals a prophylaxis against further salmon lice infestation. There was no difference in survival among years or between treatments. In years of high infestation pressure, however, sea trout remained closer to the river outlet, used freshwater (FW) habitats for longer periods and returned earlier to the river than in the low infestation year. This indicates that sea trout adapt their migratory behaviour by actively choosing FW refuges from salmon lice to escape from immediate mortality risk. Nevertheless, simulations show that these adaptations can lead to lost growth opportunities. Reduced growth can increase long-term mortality of sea trout due to prolonged exposure to size-dependent predation risk, lead to lower fecundity and, ultimately, reduce the likelihood of sea migration."}

Thus, virus free lice strains were established from virus infected lice carrying one or both LsRVs by treating them with N protein dsRNA twice during development. The viral replication of the N protein was specifically down-regulated following introduction of virus-specific dsRNA, and virus-free lice strains were maintained for several generations. A preliminary study on infection routes suggested that the LsRV-No9 is maternally transmitted, and that the virus transmits from males to females horizontally.

The Norwegian coast has been divided into 13 production zones and the volume of salmonid production in the zones will be regulated based on salmon lice effects on wild salmonids. Here we present a model for assessing salmon louse-induced mortality of seaward-migrating post-smolts of Atlantic salmon. The model quantifies expected salmon lice infestations and louse-induced mortality of migrating post-smolt salmon from 401 salmon rivers draining into Norwegian coastal waters. It is assumed that migrating post-smolts follow the shortest path from river outlets to the high seas, at constant progression rates. During this migration, fish are infested by salmon lice of farm origin according to an empirical infestation model. Furthermore, louse-induced mortality is estimated from the estimated louse infestations. Rivers draining into production zones on the West Coast of Norway were at the highest risk of adverse lice effects. In comparison, rivers draining into northerly production zones, along with the southernmost production zone, were at lower risk. After adjusting for standing stock biomass, estimates of louse-egg output varied by factors of up to 8 between production zones. Correlation between biomass adjusted output of louse infestation and densities of farmed salmon in the production zones suggests that a large-scale density-dependent host-parasite effect is a major driver of louse infestation rates and parasite-induced mortality. The estimates are sensitive to many of the processes in the chain of events in the model. Nevertheless, we argue that the model is suited to assess spatial and temporal risks associated with farm-origin salmon lice."}

Selection on lice in microevolutionary time occurs as pigeons and doves defend themselves against lice by preening. In turn, behavioral and morphological adaptations of the lice improve their ability to evade host defense. Over macroevolutionary time wing lice tend to cospeciate with their hosts; yet, some species of Columbicola have switched to new host species. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that influence coadaptation and codiversification in this system will substantially improve our understanding of coevolution in general. However, further work is hampered by the lack of a robust phylogenetic framework for Columbicola spp. and their hosts. Previous attempts to resolve the phylogeny of Columbicola based on sequences from a few genes provided limited support. Here, we apply a new approach, target restricted assembly, to assemble 977 orthologous gene sequences from whole-genome sequence data generated from very small, ethanol-preserved specimens, representing up to 61 species of wing lice. Both concatenation and coalescent methods were used to estimate the species tree. These two approaches yielded consistent and well-supported trees with 90% of all relationships receiving 100% support, which is a substantial improvement over previous studies. We used this new phylogeny to show that biogeographic ranges are generally conserved within clades of Columbicola wing lice. Limited inconsistencies are probably attributable to intercontinental dispersal of hosts, and host switching by some of the lice. [aTRAM; coalescent; coevolution; concatenation; species tree.]."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Background: Sea lice are parasitic copepods that cause large economic losses to salmon aquaculture worldwide. Frequent chemotherapeutic treatments are typically required to control this parasite, and alternative measures such as breeding for improved host resistance are desirable. Insight into the host-parasite interaction and mechanisms of host resistance can lead to improvements in selective breeding, and potentially novel treatment targets. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to study the skin transcriptome of Atlantic salmon parasitized with sea lice (C. rogercresseyi). The overall aims were to compare the transcriptomic profile of skin at louse attachment sites and 'healthy' skin, and to assess differences between animals with varying levels of resistance to the parasite. Results: Atlantic salmon were challenged with C. rogercresseyi, growth and lice count measurements were taken for each fish. 21 animals were selected and RNA-Seq was performed on skin from a louse attachment site, and skin distal to attachment sites for each animal. These animals were classified into family-balanced groups according to the traits of resistance (high vs low lice count), and growth during infestation (an indication of tolerance). Overall comparison of skin from louse attachment sites versus healthy skin showed that 4,355 genes were differentially expressed, indicating local up-regulation of several immune pathways and activation of tissue repair mechanisms. Comparison between resistant and susceptible animals highlighted expression differences in several immune response and pattern recognition genes, and also myogenic and iron availability factors. Genomic regions showing signs of differentiation between resistant and susceptible fish were identified using an Fst analysis. Conclusions: Comparison of the skin transcriptome between louse attachment sites and healthy skin has yielded a detailed profile of genes and pathways with putative roles in the local host immune response to C. rogercresseyi. The difference in skin gene expression profile between resistant and susceptible animals led to the identification of several immune and myogenic pathways potentially involved in host resistance. Components of these pathways may be targets for studies aimed at improved or novel treatment strategies, or to prioritise candidate functional polymorphisms to enhance genomic selection for host resistance in commercial salmon farming."}

The uptake rate constants (k1) for teflubenzuron, emamectin benzoate and deltamethrin in mussels were 192, 4.82 and 2003, with kinetic bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of 1304, 49 and 2516. Depuration rate constants (k2) were also found to differ between the three VMPs at 0.147, 0.048 and 0.796 for teflubenzuron, emamectin benzoate and deltamethrin, with calculated elimination half-lives (t1/2)of 4.7, 14 and 0.87\u202fdays. The longer elimination half-lives for teflubenzuron and emamectin benzoate, suggest that these chemicals accumulate in blue mussels and therefore have the potential to bioaccumulate in wild and farmed mussel populations in the environment."}
{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can spread through human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infectious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14-19th centuries), including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian inference, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine outbreaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were primary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death (1346-1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats."}

Nevertheless, some aspects, such as the efficacy of vaccines, can be largely circumvented during natural coinfections. Sea lice are ectoparasitic copepods that can occur with a high prevalence in the field, are frequently found in co-infection with other pathogens, and are highly detrimental to fish health. The aim of this case-control study was to evaluate the interaction between the detrimental effects of coinfection and the protective effects of vaccination in fish. We used the interaction between the sea louse Caligus rogercresseyi, the bacterial pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis, and their host, the Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, as a study model. Our results showed that coinfection decreased the accumulated survival (AS) and specific growth rate (SGR) of vaccinated fish (AS\u2009=\u20095.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6%; SGR\u2009=\u2009-0.05\u2009\u00b1\u20090.39%) compared to a single infection of P. salmonis (AS\u2009=\u200942.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3%; SGR\u2009=\u20090.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.22%). Concomitantly, the bacterial load and clinical signs of disease were significantly increased in coinfected fish. Coinfection may explain the reduced efficacy of vaccines in sea cages and highlights the need to test fish vaccines in more diverse conditions rather than with a single infection."}

Grooming behaviors differ among primates with respect to age and sex. Moreover, the number of ectoparasite may exhibit seasonal variation. Therefore the number of ectoparasites on a host may vary with effects, host age and sex, and season. However, these effects have not been a focus of louse infestation studies of primates. Grooming in Japanese macaques is related to sex and age, with developmental changes in behavior corresponding to the timing of tooth eruption. Moreover, behavioral data for Japanese macaques suggest that lice load may differ with the season. Thus, we examined whether the number of louse eggs varies according to host macaque sex, age, and season, and whether it changes in response to tooth eruption. We counted unhatched and hatched eggs attached to the hair on six 1-cm2 areas on the left wrist skin of culled macaques, using a stereoscopic microscope. We sampled five winter coats and three summer coats for each age class: infant, juvenile, adolescent, and adult. The number of unhatched and hatched eggs was related to age, but not to sex and season. There were significant differences in the number of unhatched eggs between infants and adults, juveniles and adults, and adolescents and adults. There were also significant differences in the number of hatched eggs between infants and adults, juveniles and adults, adolescents and adults. Tooth eruption did not influence the number of louse eggs. These results suggest that researchers should consider the age of host animals when assessing the relationship between grooming and ectoparasites."}

A major issue is the reliance of the industry on a limited number of chemicals to delouse salmonids on farms, and the high levels of resistance that lice have developed to all of these agents. However, for most of these chemicals, resistance and dispersal mechanisms are unknown. We recently demonstrated that the Phe362Tyr mutation is the primary cause of organophosphate resistance in lice collected on Norwegian farms. In the present study, we genotyped >2000 lice collected throughout the entire North Atlantic in the period 1998-2016, using Phe362Tyr and nine tightly linked SNPs. Our results showed that the Phe362Tyr mutation is strongly linked to lice survival following chemical treatment on farms located throughout the North Atlantic, demonstrating for the first time, that this mutation represents the primary mechanism for organophosphate resistance in salmon lice across the North Atlantic. Additionally, we observed multiple and diverse high frequency haplotypes linked with the allele conveying resistance to\u00a0organophosphate. We, therefore, conclude that Phe362Tyr is not a de novo mutation, but probably existed in salmon lice before the introduction of\u00a0organophosphates in commercial aquaculture."}

Post-smolt salmon infected with lice were held at 10, 13 or 16 \u00b0C, and treated with 1.5 g/L H2 O2 for 20 min at equal or lower bath temperatures of 7, 10 or 13 \u00b0C.Salmon mortality decreased as ambient and bath temperatures decreased. No mortality occurred when fish at 13 \u00b0C were treated at 7 \u00b0C. For ambient temperatures of 16 \u00b0C, the number of lice remaining was reduced by four-fold when treated at 7 \u00b0C compared with 13 \u00b0C. All treatments in which mortality was zero had similar efficacies regardless of bath temperature.We took salmon from warmer to colder temperatures to determine the optimum bathing temperature to prevent mortality. A temperature of 7 \u00b0C was optimal when treating with 1.5 g/L of H2 O2 , as mortality was zero and pre-adult lice removal was unchanged. By manipulating temperature, we developed a new method of H2 O2 bathing that reduces mortality.

Survival and morphology were registered after different exposure times. Efficacy of the ultrasonic cavitation treatments varied with exposure time. A reduction in survival was registered even for the shortest exposure time (5\u00c2\u00a0seconds) for both naupliar and copepodid stages of the salmon louse (36.7\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a011.5 and 67.20\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00b1\u00c2\u00a07.2% survival respectively). Survival reached zero after exposure times of 20 and 60\u00c2\u00a0seconds for the nauplii and copepodid stages, respectively. A reduction in 70% was observed for bacteria at all exposure times (5 to 300\u00c2\u00a0s), while a reduction of 95% was observed after 300\u00c2\u00a0s for algal cells. The logged energy transfer to the samples was on average 17.5\u00c2\u00a0J/s.

{"keyword": "lice", "texts": "The salmon louse is a highly abundant ectoparasitic copepod of salmonids in the North Pacific and Atlantic. Widespread and rapid development of resistance to chemical agents used to delouse salmonids on marine farms is now threatening the continued development of the aquaculture industry and have served as a potent catalyst for the development of alternative pest management strategies. These include freshwater and warm-water treatments to which the louse is sensitive. However, given the well-documented evolutionary capacity of this species, the risk of developing tolerance towards these environmental treatments cannot be dismissed. Two common-garden experiments were performed using full-sibling families of lice identified by DNA parentage testing to investigate whether one of the fundamental premises for evolution, in this context genetic variation in the capacity of coping with fresh or warm water, exists within this species. Significant differences in survival were observed among families in both experiments, although for the salinity experiment, it was not possible to unequivocally disentangle background mortality from treatment-induced mortality. Thus, our data demonstrate genetic variation in tolerance of warm water and are suggestive of genetic variation in salinity tolerance. We conclude that extensive use of these environmental-based treatments to delouse salmonids on commercial farms may drive lice towards increased tolerance."}

However, few studies have rigorously explored the factors driving this variation. Multiple factors such as host or parasite morphology may govern the degree of phylogenetic congruence. An ideal analysis for understanding the factors correlated with congruence would focus on a diverse host-parasite system for increased variation and statistical power. In this study, we focused on the Brueelia-complex, a diverse and widespread group of feather lice that primarily parasitise songbirds. We generated a molecular phylogeny of the lice and compared this tree with a phylogeny of their avian hosts. We also tested for the contribution of each host-parasite association to the overall congruence. The two trees overall were significantly congruent, but the contribution of individual associations to this congruence varied. To understand this variation, we developed a novel approach to test whether host, parasite or biogeographic factors were statistically associated with patterns of congruence. Both host plumage dimorphism and parasite ecomorphology were associated with patterns of congruence, whereas host body size, other plumage traits and biogeography were not. Our results lay the framework for future studies to further elucidate how these factors influence the process of host-parasite coevolution."}

As agriculture and aquaculture have become increasingly intensive in the past decades, there has been growing interest in their evolutionary effects on the life histories of agri- and aquacultural pests, parasites, and pathogens. In this study, we used salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) to explore how modern farming might have affected life history evolution in parasites. We infected salmon hosts with lice from either farmed or unfarmed locations, and monitored life history traits of those parasites in laboratory conditions. Our results show that compared to salmon lice from areas unaffected by salmon farming, those from farmed areas produced more eggs in their first clutch, and less eggs later on; they achieved higher infestation intensities in early adulthood, but suffered higher adult mortality. These results suggest that salmon lice on farms may have been selected for increased investment in early reproduction, at the expense of later fecundity and survival. This call for further empirical studies of the extent to which farming practices may alter the virulence of agricultural parasites."}

{"keyword": "benzonatate", "texts": "Benzonatate was FDA-approved in 1958 as an antitussive. Its mechanism of action is thought to be anesthesia of vagal sensory nerve fibers that mediate cough. Vagal sensory neurons highly express the Nav1.7 subtype of voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibition of this channel inhibits the cough reflex. Local anesthetics inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, but there are no reports of whether benzonatate affects these channels. Our hypothesis is that benzonatate inhibits Nav1.7 voltage-gated sodium channels. We used whole cell voltage clamp recording to test the effects of benzonatate on voltage-gated sodium (Na(+)) currents in two murine cell lines, catecholamine A differentiated (CAD) cells, which express primarily Nav1.7, and N1E-115, which express primarily Nav1.3. We found that, like local anesthetics, benzonatate strongly and reversibly inhibits voltage-gated Na(+) channels. Benzonatate causes both tonic and phasic inhibition. It has greater effects on channel inactivation than on activation, and its potency is much greater at depolarized potentials, indicating inactivated-state-specific effects. Na(+) currents in CAD cells and N1E-115 cells are similarly affected, indicating that benzonatate is not Na(+) channel subtype-specific. Benzonatate is a mixture of polyethoxy esters of 4-(butylamino) benzoic acid having varying degrees of hydrophobicity. We found that Na(+) currents are inhibited most potently by a benzonatate fraction containing the 9-ethoxy component. Detectable effects of benzonatate occur at concentrations as low as 0.3 \u03bcM, which has been reported in humans. We conclude that benzonatate has local anesthetic-like effects on voltage-gated sodium channels, including Nav1.7, which is a possible mechanism for cough suppression by the drug."}

The NEISS-CADES database captured emergency department visits involving 12 cases of overdose from accidental benzonatate ingestions in children aged 1-3\u00a0years. Signs and symptoms of overdose included seizures, cardiac arrest, coma, brain edema or anoxic encephalopathy, apnea, tachycardia, and respiratory arrest and occurred in some patients within 15\u00a0minutes of ingestion. Dispensed benzonatate prescriptions increased by approximately 52% from 2004 to 2009.Although benzonatate has a long history of safe use, accumulating cases of fatal overdose, especially in children, prompted the FDA to notify health care professionals about the risks of benzonatate overdose. Pharmacists may have a role in preventing benzonatate overdoses by counseling patients on signs and symptoms of benzonatate overdose, the need for immediate medical care, and safe storage and disposal of benzonatate."}

A 7-year retrospective review of all single substance ingestion of benzonatate reported to the National Poison Center Database System (NPDS) from 2000 to 2006. In this review, there were 2,172 patients, of which 1,280 (58%) were female. Mean age was 20\u00a0years, with 676 (30%) <6\u00a0years. Serious outcomes occurred in 116 (moderate, n\u2009=\u200981, 4%; major, n\u2009=\u200931, 1%; and death, n\u2009=\u20094, 0.2%). Mean age of those with serious outcome was 21\u00a0years, with 41 (35%) in children less than 6\u00a0years old. Forty-nine percent (1,084) patients were treated in a healthcare facility (HCF) of which 148 (7%) were admitted for medical care. Clinically significant effects that were documented included tachycardia (n\u2009=\u200931, 1%), agitation (n\u2009=\u200930, 1%), seizure (n\u2009=\u200923, 1%), coma (n\u2009=\u200914, 0.6%), ventricular dysrhythmia (n\u2009=\u20099, 0.4%), cardiac arrest (n\u2009=\u20098, 0.3%), hypotension (n\u2009=\u20097, 0.3%), and asystole (n\u2009=\u20096, 0.2%). Of patients with seizures reported, eight patients (0.4%) had multiple/discrete seizures and two had status epilepticus documented. Dysrhythmias but not seizures occurred in all fatalities in this review. Significant CNS and cardiac effects occurred in a small subset of this study (<1%), while half the patients received direct medical care in an HCF. No correlation between age and severity of medical outcome was detected by statistical analysis. A prospective study to better evaluate potential HCF triage criteria such as dosage, age, or preexisting conditions may be warranted. The fatalities from this study were due to dysrhythmias rather than seizures as previously reported in previous case reports. There were no clinical correlations between severity of outcomes and dose ingested. A median dose of 200\u00a0mg or greater suggests a potential for producing serious outcomes in a benzonatate exposure."}

Persistent cough can disrupt daily activities such as conversation, eating, breathing, and sleeping, and it can become extremely debilitating both physically and mentally. Pharmacological treatments include dextramethorphan, opioid cough suppressants, benzonatate, inhaled ipratropium, and guaifenesin. Successful cough suppression has also been demonstrated in several studies with the use of nebulized lidocaine. Nebulized lidocaine also appears to be well tolerated by patients with minimal side effects including dysphonia, oropharyngeal numbness, and bitter taste. Studies conducted thus far have been small, so larger randomized control trials comparing nebulized lidocaine to placebo need to be conducted in the future."}

One to two hours prior, the patient had ingested at least 10 200-mg Tessalon\u00ae capsules as part of a suicide attempt. The patient was sedated, intubated, and given magnesium as prophylaxis against recurrent dysrhythmias. Emergent gastric lavage was performed and well tolerated. A 24-h hypothermia protocol with 6-h cooling period was initiated. Toxicological studies, chest radiograph, and a computed tomography scan of the head were all unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and supportive care. The patient was extubated and able to follow some commands 1 week post-admission. The patient developed blindness and experienced generalized confabulations, which did not resolve.Ingestion of Tessalon\u00ae, a seemingly innocuous and widely prescribed antitussive, may pose a risk to patients due to its potential for the rapid development of life-threatening adverse events and limited treatment options in the overdose setting.

However, few agents have been shown in properly conducted clinical trials to be effective for cough due to URI. The present study evaluated the effect of benzonatate 200mg (B), guaifenesin 600 mg (G), their combination (B+G), and placebo (P) on capsaicin-induced cough in 30 adult nonsmokers with acute URI. On 3 separate days within a 7-day period, 1h after ingesting randomly assigned study drug in a double-blind fashion, subjects underwent capsaicin cough challenge testing, which involved inhalation of incremental doubling concentrations of capsaicin until the concentration of capsaicin inducing 5 or more coughs (C(5)) was attained. Each subject received 3 of 4 possible study drugs. G (p=0.01) but not B (p=NS) inhibited cough-reflex sensitivity (log C(5)) relative to P. The combination of B+G suppressed capsaicin-induced cough to a greater degree than B alone (p<0.001) or G alone (p=0.008). The mechanism by which the combination of B+G causes a potentiation of antitussive effect remains to be elucidated. Our results suggest that B+G may be an effective therapy for acute cough due to the common cold (URI)."}

{"keyword": "benzonatate", "texts": "Cough is a defense mechanism that prevents the entry of noxious materials into the respiratory system and clears foreign materials and excess secretions from the lungs and respiratory tract. In advanced cancer, it is a common symptom that interferes with the patient's daily activity and quality of life. Empiric treatment with antitussive agents is often needed. Two classes of antitussive drugs are available: (1) centrally acting: (a) opioids and (b) non-opioids; (2) peripherally acting: (a) directly and (b) indirectly. Antitussive availability varies widely around the world. Many antitussives, such as benzonatate, codeine, hydrocodone, and dextromethorphan, were extensively studied in the acute and chronic cough settings and showed relatively high efficacy and safety profiles. Benzonatate, clobutinol, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and levodropropizine were the only antitussives specifically studied in cancer and advanced cancer cough. They all have shown to be effective and safe in recommended daily dose for cough. In advanced cancer the patient's current medications, previous antitussive use, the availability of routes of administration, any history of drug abuse, the presence of other symptoms and other factors, all have a role in the selection of antitussives for prescription. A good knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, dosage, efficacy, and side effects of the available antitussives provides for better management."}

MRI is obtained with the capsules in place. In addition to the routine images, thin-section (1.0-1.3-mm) scans in a three-dimensional volume are obtained and the coordinates for each electrode position ascertained. The capsules are then replaced by electrodes and a waking and sleep recording is performed with a digital EEG instrument. Phenomena of interest are then averaged and interfaced with a source analysis program. The three-dimensional electrode coordinates are placed in a file and used to establish the electrode cloud on the basis of which source analysis proceeds. The three-dimensional source locations are then superimposed on the MRIs. The method is useful in the workup of epilepsy patients, by relating focal epileptogenic activity to definable lesions, and it also allows more precise localization of normal EEG phenomena."}

Both groups were administered 4 ml of 4% lidocaine translaryngeally. If nasal intubation was anticipated, the patients received 6 ml of 2% lidocaine jelly for nasal anesthesia.The time to obtain oropharyngeal anesthesia was measured as the time from obtaining the benzonatate capsules from the bottle or palpation of the neck to locate the hyoid bone to the time when the patient exhibited an absent gag response to an oropharyngeal airway. After completion of airway preparation, the patient's response to intubation was evaluated by an anesthesiologist blinded to the method of preparation. Medications administered for sedation and analgesia were recorded. Noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate (HR), cardiac rhythm, and three-lead ST segments (I, II, V5) were recorded and evaluated for changes from baseline. Postoperatively, the patient was questioned for recall of the intubation. The time required to obtain loss of the gag response was shorter in the benzonatate group (55.1 +/- 5.7 seconds vs 339 +/- 22.4 seconds, p less than 0.005). The patient response to intubation was similar in both groups (90% no response, 10% minimal response). No abnormal cardiac rhythms or ST segment depression occurred, and mean arterial pressure and HR did not increase more than 20%.The results of this study indicate that benzonatate capsules provide rapid and reliable oropharyngeal anesthesia in preparation for awake intubation. In addition, if excellent airway anesthesia is provided, awake intubations can be accomplished with minimal patient response and discomfort."}

It has both central and peripheral local anaesthetizing properties. The present studies were aimed at exploring the specificity of the central antitussive activity of vadocaine. Vadocaine administered in doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg was not found to be effective in any of a series of experiments, although some antinociceptive activity was shown in the hotplate test and in the writhing test at a dose of 75 mg/kg. Some deteriorative activity was noted at a dose of 75 mg/kg in tests measuring motor coordination (rotarod) and spontaneous motility. This high dose of vadocaine did not affect pentobarbital sodium-induced sleeping time nor protect the animal from pentetrazole-induced convulsions. As expected, codeine phosphate was found to be a more potent antinociceptive drug than vadocaine, also enhancing spontaneous motility. Both the control anaesthetics benzonatate and lidocaine proved rather ineffective. Benzonatate (50 mg/kg) did not alter any of the results, whereas lidocaine (50 mg/kg) caused a decrease in the number of writhings. In conclusion, vadocaine can be said to initiate minor deterioration of the central nervous system only at doses about 10 times higher than those which show antitussive activity. Acute lethal doses are still 2 to 5 times higher. The central antitussive action of vadocaine can therefore be considered fairly specific."}

Lidocaine was found to cause an effective and long-lasting partial blockade of the cardiovascular reflex responses to stimulation of the ventricular receptors. This effect was obtained at plasma concentrations of 2.5-4.7 microgram/ml, which is within the concentration range seen in patients with myocardial infarction treated with lidocaine because of its antiarrhythmic properties. Tessalon also markedly attenuated the reflex response, normally obtained when the ventricular receptors are excited, but the effect was very shortlasting when doses, producing no side effects, were used. Recordings of impulse traffic from the left ventricular receptors showed that the impaired reflex responses after lidocaine and Tessalon were due to a blockade at the receptor level. Thus both the receptor response to ventricular distension and to injection of protoveratrine (Bezold-Jarisch reflex) was markedly attenuated after infusion of lidocaine (2-4 mg/kg) or a bolus injection of Tessalon (0.2-1 mg/kg)."}

The accessibility was determined by injecting a challenging substance (veratridine and benzonatate) into the two atria and comparing the delays of the receptor response. Eighteen receptors localized in extrapulmonary airways were more accessible from the systemic circulation; they were affected with a shorter delay following left atrium injection. Six receptors in lobar bronchi and another 44 located in more distal intrapulmonary airways were preferentially accessible from the pulmonary circulation (i.e., shorter delays with right atrium injections). Only 4 receptors localized in lobar bronchi were found to be more accessible from the systemic circulation. Therefore the assumption that airway receptors that are more accessible from the pulmonary circulation are located distal to the terminal bronchioles should be re-evaluated. These results may also have important physiological implications since several endogenous substances capable of affecting airway structures have different concentrations in the mixed venous and arterial blood."}
{"keyword": "benzonatate", "texts": "In a previous paper, it was shown that the cough reflex was accompanied by a slight fall of systemic arterial pressure, tracheal constriction and tracheal vasodilation. In the present study, tracheobronchial muscular and vascular tones during the cough reflex were investigated using the blood perfused canine tracheal and bronchial preparations in situ. The cough reflex was elicited with electrical stimulation of the membraneous wall mucosa of the upper trachea. In the blood perfused tracheal preparation, a close intraarterial injection of atropine or bilateral vagotomy inhibited the tracheoconstriction but had no effect on the tracheal vasodilation during the cough reflex. In the blood perfused bronchial preparation, electrical stimulation of the upper tracheal mucosa induced bronchial constriction but not bronchial vasodilation. Lung inflation with air resulted in a bronchial vasodilation and which persisted even after a close intraarterial infusion of atropine and benzonatate and after bilateral vagotomy. These findings indicate that the tracheobronchial constriction response are primary reflex effects following coughing and the tracheobronchial vasodilation responses are secondary reflex effects induced by increase in internal pressure of the respiratory tract."}

First, the microalga was grown to completing 20\u202fdays and later, the biomass of crop was centrifuged and the extraction of lipids was performed. Two adsorption experiments were performed: (1) with nonliving Chlorella sp. (control), and (2) the obtained biomass after lipid extraction. The high antibiotic removal, 71.19% and 82.77% (control), were obtained at the lowest initial concentration. The contact time between the biosorbent and the antibiotic was 2\u202fh. The adsorption isotherm follows the Freundlich model and the obtained maximum absorption capacity was 63.29\u202fmg of antibiotic/g of biosorbent for lipid-extracted biomass, while the control follows best to the Langmuir model with 129.87\u202fmg/g in maximum absorption capacity. In summary, this biosorbent provides a potential alternative in the removal of Cephalexin."}

Data on cow health and drugs used were obtained from the farm veterinarians. A milk sample from each affected udder quarter of each cow was taken for bacterial identification before treatment. All 35 cows in the study were treated with an intramammary product containing tetracycline, neomycin, bacitracin, and prednisolone (tetracycline injector) and also simultaneously with other drugs via the intramammary or parenteral route. The withhold period of the 'tetracycline product' was eight milkings but, in all cases, longer withhold periods were prescribed due to off-label application of additional combinations of drugs. Milk samples from treated udder quarters, taken two milkings before and two after the prescribed withhold period, were analysed for antimicrobial residues. Additionally, milk samples were taken from untreated healthy udder quarters to check if any crossover of drugs had occurred. Three screening tests were used for antimicrobial detection. In 15 (42\u00b79%) cows the milk samples from the treated infected quarters contained tetracycline residues above the maximum residue limit (MRL) after the prescribed withhold period and, in two cases (5\u00b77%) the same was true for neomycin and cefquinome residues. Cephalexin above the MRL was detected in only one case (2\u00b79%). Beta-lactams did not exceed the MRL after the prescribed withhold period. Antimicrobial residues were not detected in milk samples from untreated quarters. Cow condition including parity, decreased milk production and severity of mastitis significantly influenced the excretion of antimicrobials in milk (P \u2264 0\u00b705). No significant differences were found between the tetracycline positive and tetracycline negative cows regarding the bacteria involved, combination antimicrobial therapy, or treatment interval and duration."}

Limited evidence is currently available to guide the choice of antibiotic therapy and the duration of treatment in these patients. Patients at the University Medical Center Utrecht who developed a VAD-related S. aureus infection between 2007 and 2016 were retrospectively assessed. Blood culture isolates were typed by whole genome sequencing to differentiate between relapses and reinfections, and to determine whether antibiotic therapy had led to acquisition of resistance mutations. Twenty-eight patients had S. aureus VAD infections. Ten of these patients also suffered S. aureus bacteremia. Discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was followed by relapse in 50% of the patients without prior S. aureus bacteremia and in 80% of patients with bacteremia. Oral cephalexin could ultimately suppress the infection for the duration of follow-up in 8/8 patients without S. aureus bacteremia and in 3/6 patients with S. aureus bacteremia. Clindamycin failed as suppressive therapy in 4/4 patients. Cephalexin appears an adequate choice for antibiotic suppression of VAD infections with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. In patients without systemic symptoms, it may be justified to attempt to stop therapy after treatment of the acute infection, but antibiotic suppression until heart transplant seems indicated in patients with S. aureus bacteremia."}

We examined replacing cephalothin with cephalexin because cephalexin is used more often clinically. Bacterial isolates were obtained from dogs and cats from a national surveillance program. CLSI testing methods were used to determine the MIC for 4 cephalosporins used in veterinary medicine. Cephalexin clinical breakpoints for canine isolates were established by using published pharmacokinetic data and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the probability of target attainment (PTA). For 1,112 Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolates, the mode, MIC50, and MIC90 were 1, 2, and 64 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, for cephalexin, and \u22640.06, 0.12, and 2 \u00b5g/mL for cephalothin. Susceptibility of S. pseudintermedius from 2011 to 2014 did not change for the 4 cephalosporins tested. Only 4.3% of the penicillin-binding protein 2a-positive S. pseudintermedius isolates had MIC values \u22642 \u00b5g/mL for cephalexin, but 66.3% of these isolates had MIC values \u22642 \u00b5g/mL for cephalothin. There were also discrepancies between cephalexin and cephalothin for other bacteria tested, but the largest difference was for S. pseudintermedius, with a MIC difference of 4 doubling dilutions. Cephalexin interpretive categories (breakpoints) of \u22642 \u03bcg/mL (susceptible), 4 \u03bcg/mL (intermediate), and \u22658 \u03bcg/mL (resistant) were established for isolates obtained from dogs. Cephalothin should not be used for susceptibility testing of cephalexin for veterinary bacterial pathogens, and canine-specific breakpoints should be used for testing susceptibility. Breakpoints determined using the methods described herein for the interpretive categories will be added to future CLSI tables to reflect this recommendation."}

{"keyword": "Cephalexin", "texts": "Background: Breast cancer is the second most prevalent cancer worldwide with around 1.7 million new cases diagnosed every year. Whilst prognosis is generally favourable in early stages, this worsens significantly in advanced disease. Therefore, it is pertinent to focus on mitigating factors that may slow growth or progression. Recently, the gut microbiome has been implicated in a wide-range of roles in tumour biology. Through modulation of immunity, the gut microbiota can improve the efficacy of several immunotherapies. However, despite the prevalence of breast cancer, there is still a lack of microbiota studies in this field, including exploring the influence of external microbiome-modulating factors such as antibiotics. We describe herein how disruption of the gut microbiota via antibiotics may be detrimental to patient outcomes through acceleration of tumour growth. Results: Supplementing animals with a cocktail of antibiotics leads to gut microbiota alterations and is accompanied by significant acceleration of tumour growth. Surprisingly, and distinct from previous microbiome-tumour studies, the mechanism driving these effects do not appear to be due to gross immunological changes. Analysis of intratumoural immune cell populations and cytokine production are not affected by antibiotic administration. Through global tumour transcriptomics, we have uncovered dysregulated gene expression networks relating to protein and lipid metabolism that are correlated with accelerated tumour growth. Fecal metabolomics revealed a reduction of the microbial-derived short-chain fatty acid butyrate that may contribute to accelerated tumour growth. Finally, through use of a routinely administered antibiotic in breast cancer patients, Cephalexin, we have shown that tumour growth is also significantly affected. Metataxanomic sequencing and analysis highlighted significant antibiotic-associated reductions in the butyrate producing genera Odoribacter and Anaeotruncus, and increased abundance of Bacteroides. Conclusions: Our data indicate that perturbation of the microbiota by antibiotics may have negative impacts on breast cancer patient outcomes. This is of importance as antibiotics are regularly prescribed to breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy or breast reconstruction. We have also shown that the metabolic impact of disruption to the microbiome should be considered alongside the potent immunological effects. We believe our work lays the foundation for improving the use of antibiotics in patients, and with further investigation could potentially inform clinical practice."}

These cocci are isolated from urinary tract infections, bacteremia, endocarditis, and burn wounds in humans. The evolution of antibiotic-resistant enterococci raised a problem due to the possibility of the transmission of these organisms between poultry and human. Regarding this, the present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of Enterococcus species among companion birds and poultry in the Northeastern of Iran and determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of enterococci. To this end, oral and cloacal swabs were collected from 150 caged birds. Antibiotic susceptibility profile was determined using the standard disk diffusion method. The results revealed that out of 150 samples, 56 (37.33%) cases contained enterococci. Most of the specimens (25.33%) were Enterococcus faecalis isolated from 6.66% of the samples. Additionally, 2.66% and 1.33% of the samples were contaminated with Enterococcus mundtii and Enterococcus gallinarum, respectively. Furthermore, Enterococcus malodoratus and Enterococcus raffinosus were isolated from 0.66% of the samples. The results revealed that all of the isolates of E. faecalis and E. faecium were resistant to more than five antimicrobial agents. Most of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates showed resistance to Cefazolin, Tiamulin, Flumequine, and Cephalexin. Accordingly, the majority of the isolates had multidrug resistance to the tested antibiotics. In conclusion, the presence of multidrug-resistant enterococci in the birds living close to humans requires thorough observations due to the transmission of these organisms to humans."}

For cellulitis without purulent drainage, \u03b2-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n\u2009=\u2009248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n\u2009=\u2009248 participants).The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P\u2009=\u2009.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P\u2009=\u2009.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00729937."}

Small studies have demonstrated alterations in the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics among obese children. Consequently, there is no consensus regarding appropriate dosing of antibiotics among overweight and obese children with\u00a0AHO.Methods This is a single center, retrospective, cohort study of children 2\u201317\u00a0years of age with a discharge diagnosis of acute osteomyelitis admitted between 1/1/2012 and 12/31/2015. Complicated osteomyelitis cases were excluded. Variability of the initial mg/kg antibiotic dose was determined and compared between healthy weight, overweight, and obese children.Results142 children were included in the cohort. In total, 83 (58%) were classified as healthy weight, 25 (18%) overweight, and 34 (24%) obese. No difference was found in the variability of mg/kg dosing of vancomycin or clindamycin across the three weight groups. Cefazolin dosing in healthy weight children (median 33.3mg/kg [IQR 32.9\u201336.7mg/kg]) was significantly higher as compared with obese children (24.4mg/kg \u2028[20.0\u201333.3mg/kg]) (P = 0.041). Cephalexin dosing in healthy weight children (33.0mg/kg \u2028[30.6\u201334.5mg/kg]) was also significantly higher than in obese children (23.0mg/kg [20.0\u201329.9mg/kg])(P = 0.013).Conclusion There was significant variability and lower overall dosing of first-generation cephalosporins among obese children compared with healthy weight children. Given the increasing incidence of invasive methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections, this study highlights the need for practitioners to optimize first-generation cephalosporin dosing in obese children suffering from AHO. These data also call for future studies to determine the clinical outcomes in obese children with AHO in relation to dosing adequacy.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures."}

Insufficient data currently exist to describe the effectiveness of extrapolating traditional antibiotic dosing strategies to morbidly obese patients with cellulitis. The primary objective of this study was to compare therapeutic failure rates in non-obese and morbidly obese patients with cellulitis when treated with cephalexin at standard dosing.This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort analysis. Adult patients hospitalized or under inpatient observation at a 1265-bed academic medical centre who received cephalexin monotherapy for non-purulent cellulitis from 2005 to 2015 were evaluated for inclusion. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on body mass index (BMI), where BMI <30\u00a0kg/m(2) was defined as non-obese and BMI \u226540\u00a0kg/m(2) as morbidly obese. Patients with critical risk factors for purulent or polymicrobial cellulitis were excluded. The primary outcome, therapeutic failure, was defined as a need for extended or additional antimicrobial therapy, surgical intervention, emergency department visit, or re-hospitalization within two to thirty days after cephalexin initiation.A total of 94 patients (69 non-obese and 25 morbidly obese) met inclusion and exclusion criteria, which was below the estimated sample size needed to reach desired power. The rate of therapeutic failure in the morbidly obese group was similar to the non-obese group (20% vs. 14\u00b75%, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b753). Patients most commonly had extended or additional antibiotics prescribed in response to therapeutic failure with cephalexin.Cephalexin failure rates for cellulitis did not differ statistically between morbidly obese and non-obese patients. The underpowered nature of this study is a limitation. Until further study with a larger sample size is completed, empiric adjustment of cephalexin dosing based solely on BMI may not be necessary."}

In this study we explored if they also interact to predict it. METHODS:Our sample was 9,393 adult participants of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), a large longitudinal household panel study in the UK. Inflammation was measured using C-reactive protein levels. Perceived neighbourhood cohesion was measured using a 13-item questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured with the General Health Questionnaire-12. RESULTS:Perceived neighbourhood cohesion and inflammation retained their significant main effects on psychological distress even after adjustment for confounders (age, gender, ethnicity, partner status, education, smoking status, obesity and urbanicity). The effect of neighbourhood cohesion was larger. However, we did not find evidence for an interactive association between the two. CONCLUSIONS:Perceived neighbourhood cohesion was inversely related to psychological distress, over and above other important person- and neighbourhood-level characteristics. Inflammation was also associated with psychological distress, albeit less strongly. If these associations are causal, they suggest that promoting neighbourhood cohesion can alleviate some of the burden associated with psychological distress."}

The aim of this review was to examine the current evidence linking stress and sleep with inflammation with a focus on sex differences. RECENT FINDINGS:Psychosocial stress that occurs either acutely or chronically is associated with elevated levels of systemic inflammation. While not as robust, insufficient sleep, particularly sleep disturbances, appears to be associated with higher levels of inflammatory activity as well. In several contexts, associations of stress and insufficient sleep with inflammation appear stronger in women than in men. However, this should be interpreted with caution as few studies test for sex differences. Stress and poor sleep often predict elevations in systemic inflammation. While there is some evidence that these associations are stronger in women, findings are largely mixed and more systematic investigations of sex differences in future studies are warranted."}

The proteasome activator complex subunit 3 (REG\u03b3) has been suggested to regulate experimental colitis. However, to the best of our knowledge, a potential association between REG\u03b3 and testicular inflammation has not been demonstrated. The present study successfully established inflammatory models in C57 mice, primary Leydig cells and the TM3 cell line. It was observed that the absence of REG\u03b3 conveyed a significantly protective effect toward testosterone secretion in Leydig cells. REG\u03b3 deficiency significantly decreased the expression levels of phosphorylated transcription factor p65 and inflammatory factors in testis tissues, primary Leydig cells and the TM3 cell line. Inflammation also upregulated the expression levels of REG\u03b3. Furthermore, the degradation of the nuclear factor light\u2011chain\u2011enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u2011\u03baB) inhibitor \u03b5 (IkB\u03b5) signaling pathway regulated REG\u03b3 and NF\u2011\u03baB expression.

Preterm infants with FIRS have a higher childhood incidence of neurodevelopmental disability than preterm infants without FIRS. The mechanisms connecting FIRS to neurodevelopmental disability in formerly preterm infants are not fully understood, but the effect on premature gray matter may have an important role. METHODS:Fetal rats were exposed to intra-amniotic (i.a.) LPS 2 days prior to birth to model FIRS. On postnatal day 7, expression of inflammatory mediators was measured in the liver, lung, and brain. Activation of microglia and expression of glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters were measured in the hippocampus and cortex. RESULTS:LPS caused persistent systemic inflammatory mediators gene expression. In the brain, there was corresponding activation of microglia in the hippocampus and cortex. Expression of inflammatory mediators persisted in the hippocampus, but not the cortex, and was associated with altered glutamatergic receptor subunits and transporters. CONCLUSION:Hippocampal inflammation and dysregulation of glutamate metabolism persisted well into the postnatal period following i.a. LPS. Poor neurodevelopmental outcomes after FIRS in preterm infants may result in part through glutamatergically driven gray matter injury to the neonatal hippocampus."}

In this review, we describe the inflammatory cell types, the cytokines, and the mechanisms underlying PDAC risk, growth, and progression, with particular attention on TNF\u03b1, also in the light of the potential risks or benefits associated with anti-TNF\u03b1 treatments."}

{"keyword": "Inflammation", "texts": "Inflammation in the brain is associated with various disorders including Alzheimer's disease and depression. Thus, inflammation has received increasing attention regarding preventive approaches to such disorders. Epidemiological investigations have reported that drinking tea reduces the risk of dementia and depression. Theaflavins, a polyphenol found in black tea, are known to have anti-oxidative and anti-inflammation effects, but the effects of theaflavins on cognitive decline and depression induced by inflammation have not been investigated. To address this research gap, the present study assessed whether theaflavins could protect synapses and dendrites damaged by inflammation and prevent concomitant memory impairment and depression-like behavior in mice. Intracerebroventricular injection with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces neural inflammation associated with reduced spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze test and increased immobility in the tail suspension test, indicating impaired spatial memory and depression-like behavior, respectively. Oral administration with theaflavins prevented these behavioral changes induced by LPS. Theaflavins also suppressed productions of inflammatory cytokines and prevented dendritic atrophy and spine loss in the brain. Notably, theaflavins have a stronger anti-inflammatory effect than other polyphenols such as catechin, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid. These results suggest that theaflavins can suppress neural inflammation and prevent the symptoms of inflammation-related brain disorders."}

This review examines the mechanistic commonalities between these two scourges of humanity through the lens of inflammation biology. Inflammatory pathways contribute to the initiation, the progression, and the complication of both malignant tumors and atherosclerotic plaques. Modulation of inflammatory pathways have proven transformative in the treatment of cancers and have crossed the threshold of clinical reality as treatments to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The recognition that clonal hematopoiesis drives both leukemia and cardiovascular events provides yet another link between these two seemingly disparate diseases. The nascent specialty of cardio-oncology has initially focused on the cardiovascular complications of cancer therapies. The recognition of a more profound pathophysiologic commonality between cancer and cardiovascular diseases should expand the concept of cardio-oncology. Embracing the mechanistic commonality and transcending traditional barriers between disciplines offers immense opportunities for speeding innovative research that can address the growing burden of both cancer and cardiovascular disease."}

The Glasgow Prognostic score (GPS) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are suggested measures of inflammation. However, the allocation of patients has been questioned. Hence, optimized inflammation-scores has been developed, such as the combined NLR and GPS (CNG) system, and the Aarhus composite biomarker score (ACBS). So far, these optimized inflammation-scores have not been validated in lung cancer patients. We evaluated if the optimized inflammation-scores were prognostic markers of inferior survival in lung cancer patients. Furthermore, we tested which of the optimized inflammation-scores led to better patient-allocation. MATERIAL AND METHODS:The cohort of this prospective study composed of 275 non-small cell lung cancer patients. We evaluated pre-diagnostic serum biomarkers for GPR, NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio as well as the optimized inflammation-scores CNG and ABCS as predictors of overall survival (OS), and we examined the patient-allocation derived from each inflammation-score. RESULTS:Each of the evaluated inflammation-scores could predict the overall survival even when adjustments were made for comorbidity and clinicopathological characteristics. When comparing the scores, the optimized inflammation-scores CNG and ACBS led to a better and more balanced patient-allocation. In the early clinical stages I & II, the optimized scores could reveal a subgroup of patients with poorer survival that is similar to stage III. CONCLUSION:In this cohort of lung cancer patients, we demonstrate that inflammation-scores are prognostic markers of inferior survival. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimized inflammation-scores CNG and ACBS lead to better patient-allocation independently of the clinicopathological characteristics and comorbidity."}

RESULTS:\u2003Thrombin-antithrombin complexes showed lower values intraoperatively in the CS group (p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and D-dimers tended to remain lower at intensive care unit arrival (p\u2009=\u20090.095). Tests of inflammation markers were less meaningful. CONCLUSION:\u2003Direct recirculation of pericardial fluids rather than conventional CPB itself causes major intraoperative changes of some coagulation markers. Pericardial blood loss with direct recirculation should be kept to a minimum to avoid unnecessary activation of coagulation. Inflammation markers need further investigations."}

The aim of this study was to identify the significance of inflammation-based prognostic scores and to detect the most useful score in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer after pancreaticoduodenectomy. METHODS:Between 2000 and 2015, 121 patients were enrolled in this retrospective study. The relationship between clinicopathological variables including various prognostic scores and disease-free (DFS) as well as overall (OS) survival was investigated by univariate analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to compare the predictive ability of each scoring system. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify the clinicopathological variables associated. RESULTS:In univariate analysis, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), mGPS, C-reactive protein/Alb ratio score, prognostic index, and preoperative monocyte count were significant risk factors for both DFS and OS. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of GPS is consistently larger in comparison with other four scores in both DFS as well as OS. In multivariate analysis, GPS was an independent risk factor of both tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS:GPS score is an independent tumor recurrence and prognostic factor in patients with distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer and is superior to the other prognostic scores."}

As such, genetic variability in these pathways could have a role in susceptibility for the disease as well as in the treatment outcome. Dopaminergic treatment is effective in management of motor symptoms, but poses a risk for motor and non-motor adverse events. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress on Parkinson's disease susceptibility and the occurrence of adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. METHODS:In total, 224 patients were enrolled, and their demographic and clinical data on the disease course were collected. Furthermore, a control group of 146 healthy Slovenian blood donors were included for Parkinson's disease' risk evaluation. Peripheral blood was obtained for DNA isolation. Genotyping was performed for NLRP3 rs35829419, CARD8 rs2043211, IL1\u03b2 rs16944, IL1\u03b2 rs1143623, IL6 rs1800795, CAT rs1001179, CAT rs10836235, SOD2 rs4880, NOS1 rs2293054, NOS1 rs2682826, TNF-\u03b1 rs1800629, and GPX1 rs1050450. Logistic regression was used for analysis of possible associations. RESULTS:We observed a nominally significant association of the IL1\u03b2 rs1143623 C allele with the risk for Parkinson's disease (OR\u2009=\u20090.59; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.38-0.92, p\u2009=\u20090.021). CAT rs1001179 A allele was significantly associated with peripheral edema (OR\u2009=\u20090.32; 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.15-0.68; p\u2009=\u20090.003). Other associations observed were only nominally significant after adjustments: NOS1 rs2682826 A allele and excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep attacks (OR\u2009=\u20091.75; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.00-3.06, p\u2009=\u20090.048), SOD2 rs4880 T allele and nausea/vomiting (OR\u2009=\u20090.49, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.25-0.94; p\u2009=\u20090.031), IL1\u03b2 rs1143623 C allele and orthostatic hypotension (OR\u2009=\u20090.57, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.32-1.00, p\u2009=\u20090.050), and NOS1 rs2682826 A allele and impulse control disorders (OR\u2009=\u20092.59; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.09-6.19; p\u2009=\u20090.032). We did not find any associations between selected polymorphisms and motor adverse events. CONCLUSIONS:Apart from some nominally significant associations, one significant association between CAT genetic variability and peripheral edema was observed\u00a0as well. Therefore, the results of our study suggest some links between genetic variability in inflammation- and oxidative stress-related pathways and non-motor adverse events of dopaminergic treatment. However, the investigated polymorphisms do not play a major role in the occurrence of the disease and the adverse events of dopaminergic treatment."}

Octreotide acetate is a synthetic analog of somatostatin, with similar effects but a prolonged duration of action. Octreotide acetate is routinely given by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intramuscular injection. In the present study, we examined the feasibility of oral delivery of octreotide acetate reconstituted with increasing concentrations (0.5%, 1.5% and 3.0%) of Intravail\u00ae, a patented alkylsaccharide transmucosal absorption enhancing agent. The pharmacokinetics of orally delivered (by gavage) octreotide acetate in Intravail\u00ae were compared to those of octreotide acetate administered subcutaneously in sodium acetate buffer to male Swiss Webster mice. Oral delivery of octreotide acetate in 0.5% Intravail\u00ae significantly enhanced total uptake (1254.08ng/ml/min vs. 311.63ng/ml/min, respectively), serum half-life (52.1min vs. 1.3min, respectively), and relative bioavailability (4.0 vs. 1.0, respectively) when compared to delivery by s.c. injection. Higher concentrations of Intravail \u00aedid not further enhance uptake, serum half-life, or bioavailability. The results of this study indicate that oral delivery of octreotide acetate in Intravail\u00aeis feasible, and is an effective method of administration which significantly improves uptake, bioavailability and half-life when compared to s.c. injection.

{"keyword": "Octreotide acetate", "texts": "Advanced gastric cancer frequently results in the inability to ingest food or drink orally, a condition called malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (MGO). MGO is clinically defined as a gastrointestinal outlet obstruction caused by a large tumor, or malignant bowel obstruction with peritoneal dissemination. MGO impacts the quality of life by interfering with oral intake and by causing gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Octreotide acetate (OA) is an analogue of somatostatin which has been increasingly used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms since it decreases the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of water and electrolytes. In Japan, the oral anticancer drug S-1 was recently adopted as a key chemotherapeutic agent in advanced gastric cancer; however, its oral formulation precludes its utility in the MGO setting. This is a pilot study of chemoradiotherapy plus OA in gastric cancer with MGO. Patients were initially treated with OA to control gastrointestinal symptoms. Following resolution of their symptoms, the patients received chemotherapy with S-1 plus low-dose cisplatin and radiation. Irradiation was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including the lymph nodes. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in only 1 patient, and no treatment-related deaths were noted. After treatment, 3 patients achieved a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease. Of the 9 patients, 8 were able to tolerate solid food orally and were discharged. The outcomes of these cases suggest that OA is a useful adjunctive therapy that enables advanced gastric cancer patients with MGO to receive S-1-containing chemotherapy."}

In this study, the efficacy of depot octreotide acetate was prospectively evaluated in patients with CRPC. METHODS: Eligible patients had progressive non-metastatic CRPC. Octreotide acetate 30 mg was administered intramuscularly every 28 days. Changes in PSA, IGF-1, IGF-2, IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and IGFBP-3 were evaluated over time. RESULTS: Accrual was stopped early after a pre-planned interim analysis showed no prostate specific antigen (PSA) declines after 3 cycles of treatment among the first 13 patients enrolled. Median baseline PSA and IGF-1 measurements were 36.2 ng/ml and 162.6 ng/ml, respectively, and median time on treatment was 13 weeks. Radiographic progression occurred in 7 patients, PSA-only progression occurred in 5 patients, and 1 patient was taken off the study due to a grade 3 drug interaction. After 3 cycles of treatment IGF-1 significantly declined with a median -34.5% (P = 0.01) and IGFBP-1 significantly increased with a median 76.3% (P = 0.046). IGF-2 and IGFBP-3 were not significantly changed from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Octreotide acetate significantly lowers IGF-1 and raises IGFBP-1 levels in patients with non-metastatic CRPC, but does not result in sustained declines in PSA. While treatment with single-agent octreotide may not be warranted, its inclusion in combination regimens directly targeting the IGF-1 receptor on tumor cells may be of interest."}

In all, 17 patients were treated per protocol, and four were assessed as clinical responders. Six patients developed a reduction in ALP (median -26%, range -5 to -78%). All patients increased in PSA. At baseline, three patients had a negative Octreoscan and the patients with positive lesions, demonstrated uptake of low intensity. At baseline the CgA was elevated above the normal range in 15 of the patients, and during treatment five patients decreased their CgA to the normal range. Neither baseline Octreoscan nor CgA could identify the clinical reponders. A minority of patients improves their health-related quality of life. The decrease and normalization of CgA levels in five patients during therapy indicates therapeutic activity but Octreoscan and CgA could not identify clinical responders."}

Octreotide acetate is a somatostatin analogue established in the treatment of chylothorax; however, its utility in the management of cervical chylous fistulae has not been fully evaluated. The investigators hypothesized that chylous fistula can be managed by a combination of octreotide and peripheral total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A retrospective review of cases compiled at our institution from 2009 to 2015 was conducted. Ten patients, all men, were identified as having a postoperative chylous fistula after a neck dissection. All patients were treated with peripheral TPN and intravenous octreotide. Mean age of the patients was 63.0 years (range 49 to 82). Five (50.0%) had a neck dissection for the management of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma and had previous neck irradiation. In 8 (80%) patients, chylous fistula occurred in the left neck. Seven (70.0%) of the leaks occurred within the first 2 postoperative days. Eight (80%) leaks were controlled using TPN and octreotide, with 2 (20%) patients requiring surgical intervention. No factors were significant in the successful conservative management of chylous fistulae. One patient with a chylous fistula of 1,800 ml/day was managed successfully without surgical intervention. The results of this case series suggest that chylous fistulae may be managed conservatively with octreotide and TPN. However, long-term evaluation is needed to define if and when surgical intervention is required for control."}

Histopathological specimens were obtained from the operation site and at 180 degrees from it on the 14th day after surgery.Mean ciliary epithelial thickness in the study groups was as follows: 12.29 +/- 2.69 microm in group 1 (mitomycin C), 13.85 +/- 4.56 microm in group 2 (5-fluorouracil), 17.71 +/- 3.09 microm in group 3 (cyclosporin A), 11.64 +/- 2.92 microm in group 4 (octreotide acetate), 11.92 +/- 2.89 microm in group 5 (topically applied octreotide acetate) and 21.85 +/- 4.29 microm in group 6 (control). The ciliary epithelial thickness in groups 1, 2, 4 and 5 was statistically different from that in the control group. Intracellular vacuolisation and degenerative changes of the non-pigmented epithelium, and pigment loss of the pigmented epithelium, were found mostly in group 1 and moderately in group 2 and 3.Octreotide acetate and cyclosporin A are less toxic alternatives to mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil in glaucoma filtration surgery."}
{"keyword": "Octreotide acetate", "texts": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly the regimens that contain 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), can produce diarrhea. Octreotide acetate appears to have a major therapeutic effect in the management of 5-FU-induced diarrhea. A prospective study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of two different doses of octreotide acetate, 100 \u00b5g and 500 \u00b5g three times daily, for the treatment of severe 5-FU-induced diarrhea refractory to loperamide, and also to evaluate whether the higher dose is more effective in the management of this complication. Fifty-nine patients with tissue-documented colorectal and head and neck carcinoma were enrolled in this study, 28 in the 100 \u00b5g arm and 31 in the 500 \u00b5g arm of octreotide acetate which was administered s.c. three times daily. Patients were required to have National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria </= grade 3 diarrhea secondary to treatment with the 5-FU regimen. Octreotide acetate was well tolerated by all patients. Complete resolution of diarrhea was achieved in 17 of 28 (60.71%) patients treated with 100 \u00b5g, and in 28 of 31 (90.32%) patients treated with 500 \u00b5g of octreotide (p < 0.05). This study suggests a significant benefit in the treatment of 5-FU-induced diarrhea in favor of the 500 \u00b5g versus the 100 \u00b5g arm. These results support the dose-response effect of octreotide acetate. Even though higher doses of octreotide are more expensive, the cost saved in reduced hospitalization makes the higher dose more cost-effective."}
{"keyword": "Octreotide acetate", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Somatostatin analogues are the best therapy for controlling the symptoms of malignant carcinoid syndrome. Octreotide acetate given as subcutaneous injection up to three times daily, intramuscular Lanreotide injection given once per 1-2 weeks and monthly intramuscular Sandostatin LAR have demonstrated similar efficacy in short-term studies. AIM: To assess the long-term effect of Sandostatin LAR on the management of patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome. METHODS: This was a 3-year retrospective study. Twenty-seven patients were assessed with a median follow-up of 23 months. Thirteen patients were switched from subcutaneous octreotide and 14 patients were octreotide naive. All patients showed avid uptake on indium-111 octreotide imaging. RESULTS: Ten of the 13 patients previously on subcutaneous octreotide and 13 of the 14 patients who were octreotide naive had good symptom control on Sandostatin LAR. Over the period of follow-up, many patients showed progression of their tumour and required additional therapies. Patients expressed a preference for monthly intramuscular Sandostatin LAR as opposed to daily subcutaneous injections of octreotide. Although Sandostatin LAR was difficult to administer in certain instances, overall it was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Sandostatin LAR provides good long-term symptomatic control in patients with malignant carcinoid syndrome; it is well tolerated and patients expressed improved satisfaction in their management."}

Octreotide acetate induced a prompt decrease in serum insulin level, accompanied with an increase in plasma glucose in both patients. Following the decrease in serum insulin level, serum leptin concentrations were profoundly decreased by 66% and 44%, 8-12 hrs after octreotide injection; that is, the concentrations decreased from 41.1 to 13.8 ng/ml in patient 1, and from 17.5 to 9.8 ng/ml in patient 2. Daily profiles of plasma glucose, serum insulin and leptin without octreotide administration did not show such alterations in these indexes in patient 1. These data show that circulating leptin may be susceptible to decline dependent on the decrease in serum insulin, suggesting that insulin plays a crucial role in the maintenance of leptin secretion in humans."}

Octreotide has been successfully used following pancreatic surgery to reduce exocrine function and most recently in the management of adult pancreatic pseudocysts. We report the efficacy of octreotide, as an adjunct to treatment, in two children with pancreatic pseudocyst. Each child was treated conservatively with bowel rest, hyperalimentation, and octreotide acetate (2.5 micrograms/kg SQ QD). Complete resolution of the pseudocysts occurred within 5 weeks. We conclude that octreotide acetate is a safe and potentially effective adjunct in the treatment of pediatric pancreatic pseudocyst, and should be added to the management of pseudocyst before drainage procedures."}

This study examined the use of octreotide after pancreatic trauma. The charts of all patients treated for pancreatic injuries from June 1988 to February 1992 were reviewed (n = 28). The mean age of the patients was 29 years (range 16 to 61). The mechanism of injury was motor vehicle accident in 7 patients, gunshot wounds in 14, and stab wounds in 7. The mean (+/- SD) abdominal trauma index (ATI) was 33 +/- 14 and injury severity score (ISS) was 22 +/- 12. Pancreatic injuries were graded as grade I (contusion) in 6 patients, grade II (parenchymal injury) in 18, and grade III (ductal injury) in 4. Seven patients (6 grade II and 1 grade III) were treated with prophylactic octreotide acetate, 150 micrograms to 300 micrograms per day, beginning on day 1. There were no pancreatic complications in this group. Of the remaining 21 patients, 6 (29%) developed 9 pancreatic complications: fluid collections in 3, fistula in 4, pseudocyst in 1, and pancreatitis in 1.

Octreotide acetate, a somatostatin analog, has been shown to inhibit the cellular proliferation of a variety of cell types. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of octreotide acetate on the growth of rabbit retinal pigment epithelial cells in culture. METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelial cells were isolated from rabbits and maintained in culture. Cells were exposed to standard media or media supplemented with octreotide acetate 10(-4) M to 10(-12) M for five days. Each concentration of octreotide acetate was tested in quadruplicate. RESULTS: Exposure of rabbit retinal pigment epithelial cells to octreotide acetate significantly inhibited proliferation with a peak effect at 10(-8) M. The effect of octreotide is biphasic with higher and lower concentrations having less effect than 10(-8) M. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that octreotide acetate may be useful in the treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy; however, the optimum therapeutic dose range for this drug may be narrow."}

We hypothesized that octreotide acetate (Sandostatin), a somatostatin analog, decreases the pancreatic flow rate through a peptide-mediated mechanism and alters pancreatic fluid composition by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase action and circulating peptide levels. To test this hypothesis, we collected pancreatic fluid from six patients (four with pancreatic fistulas and two with pancreatic drains after pancreatic resection). Pancreatic fluid volume and chloride, sodium, potassium, amylase, lipase, and bicarbonate levels were measured before and after octreotide acetate therapy. Octreotide acetate reduced pancreatic fluid output by a mean of 75 percent (p less than 0.05), increased chloride concentration by 21 percent (p less than 0.05), and reduced bicarbonate content by 45 percent (p less than 0.05). Sodium levels were unchanged, but the potassium concentration was increased by 14 percent (p less than 0.05). Total amylase and lipase production per 24 hours was decreased by 63 percent and 27 percent, respectively (differences not significant). Somatostatin may be useful in the treatment of established pancreatic fistulas and may be a useful prophylactic tool to prevent postoperative fistula formation."}

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of this agent on exocrine secretion in the denervated canine pancreas, utilizing animals with pancreatic autografts and functioning pancreaticocystostomies. The rates of secretion of urinary (autograft) amylase (units/min) and bicarbonate (mM/min), over a five-hr interval, were determined in the basal state (group A, n = 10), after a bolus injection of 400 micrograms of Sandostatin (group B, n = 5), after a standard meal (group C, n = 5), or a meal preceded by 400 micrograms of Sandostatin (group D, n = 5). Basal secretion of amylase was decreased for 4 hr following Sandostatin, although this decrease was not significant. Conversely, basal bicarbonate secretion was not inhibited by Sandostatin. When compared with group C (22.4 +/- 3.2), a significant inhibition of meal-stimulated amylase release was demonstrated in group D (5.4 +/- 0.21, P = 0.0006) during the first hour after Sandostatin was given. This inhibition remained significant at 2 hr (group C = 38.5 +/- 5.2 versus group D = 9.4 +/- 0.8; P = 0.0006) and 3 hr (group C = 38.6 +/- 6.3 versus group D = 17.5 +/- 0.9; P = 0.0108) after Sandostatin was given. In addition, meal-stimulated bicarbonate secretion was significantly inhibited for 2 hr following Sandostatin (group C = 0.19 +/- 0.03 versus group D = 0.07 +/- 0.02, P = 0.0096; and group C = 0.23 +/- 0.03 versus group D = 0.10 +/- 0.01, P = 0.0018, respectively).

We hypothesized that this may be related to its effects on inhibiting gastric emptying and delaying intestinal transit. To study the effect of octreotide acetate on intestinal motility in patients we carried out a randomized, double-blinded study using a subcutaneous injection of either octreotide acetate (100 micrograms) or placebo given 20 min prior to ingestion of a high carbohydrate \"dumping\" meal in six patients with known severe dumping syndrome. Prior to each study a multilumen polyethylene tube was inserted into the efferent limb to study small intestinal contractions using low compliance pneumo-hydraulic water-perfused manometry. Octreotide acetate prevented dumping symptoms in all six patients and induced the appearance of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) characteristic of interdigestive motility. After ingestion of the dumping meal the postprandial \"fed\" motility pattern lasted for 141 +/- 9 min while after octreotide acetate the fed motility lasted for 29 +/- 5 min (P less than 0.03). The vigor of the fed motility pattern as measured by the motility index (MI = loge (sum of amplitudes X No. of contractions + 1] was lower after octreotide acetate than after placebo (15.1 +/- 0.1 vs 13.4 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.03). The induction of fasting MMC motility pattern and reduction in the duration and vigor of fed motility may explain the symptomatic relief these patients obtained with octreotide acetate. It is not known whether the induction of the MMC is a direct effect of octreotide acetate or secondary to the concomitant inhibition of peptide release (neurotensin, insulin, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide) that has been demonstrated in earlier studies."}

{"keyword": "Pindolol", "texts": "Hypothesis The hypotheses of all the four included studies share the common idea that it is possible to augment the effect of antidepressant drug treatment by applying different interventions and with each intervention attain a clinically meaningful better effect compared to a control condition, and with minor side effects, thus improving the short- and medium-term outcome in major depression. Procedures Study design The basic study design has been the double blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). In the light therapy study, all patients were treated with sertraline for the whole of the study duration. In the first five weeks of the study, patients were randomised to treatment with either 60 minutes of bright white or 30 minutes of dim red light (sham condition). In the four weeks follow-up period, patients were treated with sertraline alone. In the Pindolol study, all patients were treated with venlafaxine and randomised to augmentation with either active or placebo matching pindolol tablets. In the PEMF study patients were continued on ongoing medication and randomised to augmentation with active or inactive (sham) 30 minutes daily PEMF treatment on weekdays. In the Chronos study all patients were treated with duloxetine and randomized to either a combination of three wake therapies with daily bright light treatment and sleep time stabilisation (wake group) or to daily exercise of minimum 30 minutes as an active control intervention (exercise group). The Chronos study was divided into: (1) a one-week run-in phase where duloxetine were started (and continued for the whole 29 week study period), (2) a one-week inpatient intervention phase where patient in the wake group did three wake therapies (sleep abstinence for the whole night and the following day until evening) in combination with daily light therapy and guidance on sleep time stabilisation and patients in the exercise group started a daily exercise program, (3) a seven week continuation phase where patient in the wake group continued light therapy and sleep time stabilisation and patients in the exercise group continued an individual exercise program, and (4) a 20 week follow-up phase with the same treatment elements but where duloxetine dosage could be adjusted or changed to other antidepressants. Recruitment Patients recruited for these studies were allocated from general practitioners, psychiatric specialist practices and for the lesser part from open psychiatric wards. Only a few patients were re-cruited through advertisements (in the PEMF and Chronos studies). \u00a0 Inclusion criteria Inclusion criteria were major depression according to the DSM-IV, including a depressive episode as part of a bipolar disorder. For the PEMF study, treatment resistance was a specific inclusion criterion. Duration of studies Study duration was nine weeks for the light therapy study, 19 days for the Pindolol study, five weeks for the PEMF study, and 29 weeks for the Chronos study. Assessments In all studies, assessments were done with clinician rated scales, patient self-assessment scales, including quality of life scales and a side effect scale. As clinician rated scales we used the Hamilton depression rating scale: the HAM-D17 and its 6 item subscale: the HAM-D6, the Bech Rafaelsen Melancholia scale (MES), and the Bech Rafaelsen Mania scale (MAS). As self-assessment scales we used the Major Depression Inventory (MDI), the Symptom Check-list (SCL-92), and the Preskorn scale. For side effects we used the UKU scale. Further scales used are mentioned in the specific study sections. Assessments in the light therapy study were done weekly for the first six weeks and finally after nine weeks; at four time points in the Pindolol study (baseline, days 6, 11 and 19), weekly for five weeks in the PEMF study and weekly for the first nine weeks of the Chronos study and thereafter every four weeks. The clinical setting for evaluation has been the Psychiatric Research Unit at Mental Health Centre North Zealand. For the Bright Light study, Pindolol and PEMF study patients were also seen at a psychiatric specialist practice in Copenhagen. Biochemical measures In the Light therapy study saliva cortisol was collected at baseline before start of light therapy and sertraline and blood was drawn for thyroid analysis. In the Chronos study saliva and 24 hour urine cortisol was collected in the patients randomised to the exercise group. Main results The main results from the Bright Light study covering the first five weeks of the study are given in the PhD thesis \"Adjunctive bright light in nonseasonal major depression\" defended and awarded on the 18 November 2004 at the University of Copenhagen. Results from the cortisol measurement and for the four weeks extension period were published in separate papers after the PhD thesis and are included in this thesis. Results from the Bright Light study Analysis of the saliva cortisol measurements taken at baseline of the study as cortisol awakening profiles (CAR) showed that patients responded differentially to light treatment according to their CAR levels (dichotomized to high or low about the mean). Thus, in the bright light group HAM-D17 scores were reduced by 15.7 (4.2) points for patients with a low CAR (below mean), and 11.4 (4.8) points for patients with a high CAR (above mean). In the dim light group the corresponding values were 11.1 (5.2) for patients with a low CAR and 11.3 (5.3) for patients with a high CAR. This interaction between CAR and treatment group was statistically significant (p = 0.006). Survival analysis, for the first five weeks of the study period, showed a statistically significant higher response rate (\u03c72= 9.6, p =0.002) and higher remission rate (\u03c72 = 12.5, p = 0.0004) for the bright light treated group versus the dim light treated group. At end of the five weeks of light treatment response rates were 66.7% versus 40.7 % and remission rates were 41.7 % versus 14.8 % for the bright versus dim light treated group. In the subsequent publication that covered the four weeks extension period where light treatment was discontinued, data showed that the attained differences in response and remission rates between groups were not sustained. The offset of effect was nearly complete after four weeks of continued treatment on sertraline only. Thus, at end-point, response rates were 79.2 % versus 75.9 % and remission rates were 60 .4 % versus 55.6% in the bright versus dim light groups. The conclusion reached was that bright light in non-seasonal depression should be used to achieve an earlier antidepressant response and that light therapy probably should be of longer duration. Results from the Pindolol study The results from the Pindolol study showed that pindolol did not augment the effect of venlafaxine for the whole sample. However, for those patients classified as slow metabolizers, based on their O-desmethylvenlafaxine/venlafaxine ratio (ODV/V), pindolol did augment the antidepressant effect. For patients classified as fast metabolizers, pindolol worsened the outcome. This interaction between ODV/V ratio and treatment group was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Results from the PEMF study The results from the PEMF Study showed that treatment with active versus sham PEMF augmented the effect of the ongoing anti-depressant medication treatment. Thus, patients in the active PEMF group attained a statistically significant greater score reduction from week one and at all subsequent assessments compared to the sham treated group (p < 0.01). Response and remission rates in the active PEMF group were also larger than in the sham treated group with response rates at endpoint of 61.0 % versus 12.9 % (p < 0.01) and remission rates of 33.9 % versus 4.1 % (p < 0.05). Results from the Chronos study The Chronos study, published in three papers, covers a one-week intervention phase, a seven weeks continuation phase, and a 20 weeks follow-up phase. Results from the intervention week showed that patient treated in the wake group, from the day after the first wake therapy, had en clinically and statistically significant better antidepressant effect compared to the exercise group. On the HAM-D6 scale (which does not contains sleep items), patients in the wake group had a response rate after the first wake therapy of 58.7% versus 13.7% i the exercise group (p <0.0001) and a remission rate of 38.6% versus 2.9% (p <0.0001). After the second recovery sleep (the night after the second wake therapy = dag 5) patients in the wake group had a response rate of 75.0% versus 25.1% in the exercise group (p <0.0001) and remission rates of 58.6% versus 6.0% (p <0.0001). Results from the continuation phase showed, on the HAM-D17 scale which was used at all the following assessments, at week two response rates of 41.4% in the wake group and 12.8% in the exercise group (p = 0.003) and remission rates of 23.9% versus 5.4% (p = 0,004). This clinically relevant and statistically significant difference between the wake and exercise groups was maintained at all the subsequent assessments with response rates of 71.4% versus 47.3% (p = 0.04) and remission rates of 45.6% versus 23.1% (p = 0.04), at week nine. Results from the 20 weeks follow-up phase showed a continued better effect in the wake group at all visits with HAM-D17 depression scored at week 29 of 7.5 (SE = 0.9) in the wake group versus 10.1 (SE = 0.9), (p = 0.02) in the exercise group. Remission rates were higher in the wake group with endpoint rates of 61.9% versus 37.9% (p = 0.01) in the exercise group. Response rates was only numerically, but not statistically, higher in the wake group with 74.6% versus 64.4% in the exercise group (p = 0.22). The sleep diary data showed a statistically smaller day-to-day variation in sleep onset, sleep midpoint, sleep offset and sleep duration in the wake group compared to the exercise group as a sign of better day-to-day sleep-wake cycle control in the wake group (p < 0.01). In the first nine weeks of the study patients in the wake group had a moderate sleep phase advance that diminished during the follow-up period. The hypothesised predictors for response to wake therapy were confirmed. Thus, in the wake group, a positive diurnal variation (morning worst, evening best) was associated with a better out-come, after the wake therapies, compared to a negative diurnal variation (morning best, evening worst). In the exercise group, the reverse was found, as a positive diurnal variation was associated with worse outcome, compared to a negative diurnal variation. This interaction between group and diurnal variation was statistically significant (p = 0.0004). The positive predictive value of response to the first wake therapy (i.e. maintaining response also at week two) was 56.3 % and the negative predictive value of non-response to the first wake therapy (i.e. maintaining no response also at week two) was 75.0 %. The impact of naps on depression severity was examined. In the wake group, patients who napped on the days after wake therapy compared to those patients not napping, had a more severe deterioration at the following assessment at week two (p = 0.02). Patients in the exercise group were able to perform exercise with a mean of 63.0 minutes/day (55.3) for the first eight weeks."}

{"keyword": "Pindolol", "texts": "Alcohol dependence is a debilitating disorder with current therapies displaying limited efficacy and/or compliance. Consequently, there is a critical need for improved pharmacotherapeutic strategies to manage alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Previous studies have shown that the development of alcohol dependence involves repeated cycles of binge-like ethanol intake and abstinence. Therefore, we used a model of binge-ethanol consumption (drinking-in-the-dark) in mice to test the effects of compounds known to modify the activity of neurotransmitters implicated in alcohol addiction. From this, we have identified the FDA-approved antihypertensive drug pindolol, as a potential candidate for the management of AUDs. We show that the efficacy of pindolol to reduce ethanol consumption is enhanced following long-term (12\u2009weeks) binge-ethanol intake, compared with short-term (4\u2009weeks) intake. Furthermore, pindolol had no effect on locomotor activity or consumption of the natural reward sucrose. Because pindolol acts as a dual beta-adrenergic antagonist and 5-HT1A/1B partial agonist, we examined its effect on spontaneous synaptic activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a brain region densely innervated by serotonin and norepinephrine-containing fibres. Pindolol increased spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic current frequency of BLA principal neurons from long-term ethanol-consuming mice but not na\u00efve mice. Additionally, this effect was blocked by the 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist methiothepin, suggesting that altered serotonergic activity in the BLA may contribute to the efficacy of pindolol to reduce ethanol intake following long-term exposure. Although further mechanistic investigations are required, this study demonstrates the potential of pindolol as a new treatment option for AUDs that can be fast-tracked into human clinical studies."}
{"keyword": "Pindolol", "texts": "Conventionally, receptor occupancy assays employ radiolabelled tracer. However, recent advances with non-radiolabelled tracers brought a revolution in target engagement assays. Non-radiolabelled tracer based receptor occupancy uses LC-MS/MS based quantification. It offers simultaneous quantification of more than one tracer; thus, provides the feasibility of evaluating multiple targets in a single animal. In the present study, we demonstrated simultaneous measurement of serotonin 1A, serotonin 2A, and dopamine 2 receptor occupancy using non-radiolabelled tracers in rats.Non-radiolabelled WAY-100635 or MDL-100,907 or raclopride were used as tracers for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D2 receptors, respectively. In-vivo brain distribution of these tracers was measured after administration as individual or as a mixture of tracers (cocktail tracer). Similarly, in-vitro brain free fractions were evaluated with the single and cocktail tracer in brain homogenates. The mass spectrometer was used for simultaneous quantification of tracers in both in-vivo and in-vitro samples. A ratio method was employed for calculation of receptor occupancy after single and cocktail tracer administration. Pindolol, olanzapine, and ziprasidone were used as tool compounds for demonstrating receptor occupancy at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D2 receptors.In optimization studies, regional distribution and concentration ratios (specific to non-specific) of these tracers were unaltered with individual and cocktail tracer. Non-significant variability was observed in brain free fraction of tracers' indicating the minimal binding interactions in this tracer combination. The half-maximal effective dose (ED50) for pindolol (5-HT1A 1.37 & 2.42mg/kg, i.v.), olanzapine (5-HT2A 1.37 & 2.12 and D2 1.90 & 2.72mg/kg, p.o.), and ziprasidone (5-HT1A 10.92 & 9.57; 5-HT2A 0.03 & 0.04 and D2 0.11 & 0.08mg/kg, i.v.) were comparable with individual or cocktail tracer.The present study demonstrated the utility of non-radiolabelled tracers in simultaneous measurement of multiple target engagement. Use of this method will minimize the time, in addition to the cost in translational research."}

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studied on unipolar SSRI-resistant depressed adults were included. The primary outcome was mean change scores of depressive symptom on the depression rating scales, assessed with standardized mean differences.Five RCTs consisting of 154 patients met all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Among dendrimers, Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) has received substantial attention as a novel drug carrier and delivery system. Depending on the generation and type of terminal groups, dendrimer toxicity could change and include cytotoxicity. Although PAMAM is water soluble, molecular modeling of the dendrimer-drug complex is considered challenging for exploring the conformational mobility of dendrimers and atomic specific interactions during the dendrimer-drug association. However, conventional protocols for predicting binding affinities have been designed for small protein molecules or protein-protein complexes that can be applied to study the dendrimer-drug association. In this work, we performed docking calculations for a set of 94 previously reported compounds on PAMAM of fourth generation (G4-PAMAM) to select six compounds, cromoglicic acid (CRO) - a mast cell stabilizer, Fusidic acid (FUS) - a bacteriostatic antibiotic, and Methotrexate (MTX) - a chemotherapy agent and immune system suppressant, which have the highest affinities for G4-PAMAM, and Lidocaine (LDC) - used to numb tissue in a specific area and for ventricular tachycardia treatment, Metoprolol (MET) - a \u03b21 receptor blocker, and Pindolol (PIN) - a \u03b2 blocker, which have the lowest affinities for the G4-PAMAM dendrimer, to perform MD simulations combined with the molecular mechanics generalized/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area MMGBSA/MMPBSA approach to investigate the interactions of generating 4 charge-neutral, charge-basic and charge-acid G4-PAMAM dendrimers. In addition, to validate these theoretical G4-PAMAM-drug complexes, the complexes were experimentally conjugated to determine their stability in aqueous solubility studies immediately and over one year. Our results show that among the different commercial drugs, both charged and neutral PAMAM have the most favorable binding free energies for CRO, MTX, and FUS, which appears to be due to a complex counterbalance of electrostatics and van der Waals interactions. These theoretical and aqueous solubility studies supported the high affinity of methotrexate for the G4-PAMAM-drug due to its carboxyl and aryl moieties that favor its accommodation by noncovalent interactions."}

Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are synthetic receptors having potential applications in drug delivery systems and devices such as diagnostic sensors. In the present work, ab initio quantum mechanical simulations and computational screening were used to identify functional monomer having best interactions with PDL. A virtual library of 16 functional monomers was built and the possible minimum energy conformation of the monomers and PDL were calculated using Hartree-Fock (HF) method for the synthesis of PDL imprinted polymer. The interaction energy between functional monomer and the template were corrected by means of basis set superposition error (BSSE) in all pre-polymerization complexes. The hydrogen bonding between PDL and functional monomer was evaluated by changes in bond lengths before and after complex formation. The virtual template-monomer complex with highest interaction energy is more stable during the polymerization and leads to high selectivity and specificity toward the template. The interaction energy of PDL was found to be the highest with itaconic acid followed by 4-vinyl pyridine and least with acrylonitrile. Taking a spectroscopic viewpoint, results obtained from analysis of the harmonic infrared spectrum were examined. Red and blue shifts related to the stretching frequencies of either donors or acceptors of protons were identified and compared experimentally. Stoichiometric mole ratio of template to functional monomer was optimized and confirmed by UV visible spectra titrations. The theoretical results were correlated by evaluation of binding parameters of MIPs. The experimental binding results were in good agreement with theoretical computations."}

Thereafter, maternal inspiratory oxygen fraction was decreased to induce fetal hypoxemia. At the end of each phase, fetal hemodynamics were assessed by Doppler ultrasonography. The data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA.Maternal administration of norepinephrine had no effect on fetal hemodynamics. Pindolol decreased fetal heart rate and weight-indexed left ventricular cardiac output and increased pulmonary vascular impedances, while labetalol had no effect on these parameters. During hypoxemia, fetal heart rate increased to baseline in the pindolol group and pulmonary vascular impedances increased in the labetalol group, with no changes in fetal cardiac outputs.Pindolol decreased fetal left ventricular cardiac output and induced vasoconstriction in the pulmonary vasculature, but neither pindolol nor labetalol significantly modified fetal cardiopulmonary responses to acute hypoxemia."}
{"keyword": "Pindolol", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Partial agonists are a subclass of beta blockers used to treat hypertension in many countries. Partial agonist act by stimulating beta receptors when they are quiescent and blocking beta receptors when they are active. The blood pressure (BP) lowering effect of partial agonist beta blockers has not been quantified. OBJECTIVES:To quantify the dose-related effects of various partial agonists beta blockers on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate versus placebo in patients with primary hypertension. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomized controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled parallel or cross-over trials. Studies must contain a partial agonist monotherapy arm with fixed dose. Patients enrolled into the studies must have primary hypertension at baseline (defined as SBP/DBP > 140/90 mmHg). Duration of studies must be between three to 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two authors (GW and HB) confirmed the inclusion of studies and extracted the data independently. MAIN RESULTS:Thirteen randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trials that examined the blood pressure lowering efficacy of six partial agonists in 605 hypertensive patients were included in this review. Five of the included studies were parallel studies and the other eight were cross-over studies. The overall risk of bias is high in this review due to the small sample size and high risk of detection bias. Pindolol, celiprolol and alprenolol lowered SBP and DBP compared to placebo. Acebutolol lowered SBP but there was no clear evidence that it lowered DBP. There was no clear evidence that pindolol and oxprenolol lowered SBP or DBP. Other than for celiprolol, sample sizes were generally small increasing the uncertainty in findings for individual agents versus placebo. In patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists (considered as a subclass) lowered peak BP by an average of 8 mmHg systolic (95% CI, -10 to -6, very low quality evidence), 4 mmHg diastolic (95%CI, -5 to -3, very low quality evidence) and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute (95%CI, -6 to -4, very low quality evidence). Higher dose partial agonists did not appear to provide additional BP lowering effects compared to lower dose. The maximum BP lowering effect of the overall subclass occurred at the starting dose. Partial agonists reduced pulse pressure by 4 mmHg (95% CI, -5 to -2, very low evidence). Only one study reported withdrawal due to adverse effects, the risk ratio (95% confidence interval) was 0.72 (0.07, 7.67). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:There was very low quality evidence that in patients with moderate to severe hypertension, partial agonists lowered peak BP by an average of 8/4 mmHg and reduced heart rate by five beats per minute. There was no evidence of a greater effect at doses higher than the initial doses. This estimate was probably exaggerated as it was subject to a high risk of bias. Based on the indirect comparison of the results in this review and two Cochrane reviews on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which also used similar inclusion criteria as this review, the BP lowering effect appeared to be less than the effect in patients with mild to moderate elevated BP who were taking ACE inhibitors and ARBs based on an indirect comparison. Withdrawals due to adverse effects were only reported in one trial so it is impossible to assess the harm of these drugs."}
{"keyword": "Pindolol", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Pindolol has been widely investigated as an augmenter of antidepressant drug response. Results have been inconsistent. In this study, we used pindolol together with venlafaxine because of its ability to achieve a rapid onset of serotonin transporter blockade. AIMS: The object of this study was thus to investigate if pindolol augments the antidepressant response to venlafaxine. METHODS: Patients with major depression were randomized to either active or placebo pindolol 20 mg retard daily dosage and concomitantly treated with venlafaxine for 19 days. Depression severity was evaluated at four visits. Plasma concentrations of venlafaxine and its major metabolites O-desmethylvenlafaxine (ODV) and N-desmethylvenlafaxine (NDV) and pindolol were analysed. The ratio of ODV/venlafaxine was calculated. A low ratio corresponds to patients being poor metabolizers and a high ratio corresponds to patients being extensive metabolizers. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in depression outcome was found between treatment groups. A statistically significant effect was, however, found of the ratio of ODV/venlafaxine on depression outcome, showing an augmenting effect of pindolol in patients with a low ratio, and the reverse in patients with a high ratio. CONCLUSION: The differential effect of pindolol, on depression outcome, in patients with varying degrees of venlafaxine metabolism into ODV, corresponds to patients being poor or extensive metabolizers of venlafaxine. From this finding, we conclude that only patients who are poor metabolizers of venlafaxine might benefit from pindolol augmentation. This mechanism might explain some of the variability of outcome in pindolol augmentation studies."}

One such receptor, the 5-HT1A receptor (HTR1A), is the most widely studied subtype and represents a significant molecular target in medicinal and therapeutic fields. Yeast-based fluorescent reporter systems have proven to be especially useful for GPCR assays, since detection using a fluorescent reporter considerably simplifies measurement procedures. However, previously reported systems using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as the reporter in yeast still showed low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios, making EGFP difficult to apply as an easily accessible tool. Therefore, we constructed a refined yeast-based GPCR biosensor employing a high-sensitivity strain that incorporated both a G\u03b1-engineered receptor and a fluorescent reporter (ZsGreen). As we report here, the refined yeast-based fluorescent biosensor was applied successfully to antagonist characterization and analysis of site-directed mutants of the HTR1A receptor. Pindolol, a known antagonist of HTR1A, specifically inhibited agonist-induced signaling, demonstrating the ease of evaluating inhibition effects using our reporter strain. Characterization of site-specific receptor mutants confirmed the role of specific targeted residues, including the highly conserved DRY motif, in the activation of HTR1A. Thus, our refined yeast biosensor strain, which incorporates a ZsGreen reporter and an engineered G\u03b1 receptor, is expected to serve as a simple and practical sensing tool for evaluating the ligand candidates and defining residues important to the function of human GPCRs.

It was hypothesized that pretreatment with 5-HT(1) and 5-HT(2) receptor blockers would prevent MDMA effects on mood and impulsivity. Subjects (N = 17) participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject design involving 6 experimental conditions consisting of pretreatment (T1) and treatment (T2). T1 preceded T2 by 30 minutes. T1-T2 combinations were: placebo-placebo, 20 mg pindolol-placebo, 50 mg ketanserin-placebo, placebo-75 mg MDMA, 20 mg pindolol-75 mg MDMA and 50 mg ketanserin-75 g MDMA. Subjects completed a Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire and several impulsivity tasks (Stop signal task, Matching familiar figures task, Cue dependent reversal learning task) at 1.5 hrs post-treatment. MDMA alone increased both positive (vigor, arousal, friendliness, elation, positive mood) and negative affect (anxiety, confusion) as assessed by the POMS questionnaire. MDMA also increased stop reaction time in the Stop signal task and reaction time in the Matching familiar figures task. Pretreatment with ketanserin blocked MDMA effects on positive affect, but not negative affect. Ketanserin did not influence the effects of MDMA on impulsivity. Pindolol did not interact with MDMA on any of the measures. In conclusion, 5-HT(2) receptors mediate positive moods induced by MDMA but not negative moods or impulsivity. 5-HT(1) receptors do not appear to be involved in MDMA effects on mood and impulse control.

In clinical practice, beta-blockers are often withheld in patients with stimulant intoxication because they may increase hypertension and coronary artery vasospasm due to loss of beta(2)-mediated vasodilation and unopposed alpha-receptor activation. However, it is unknown whether beta-blockers affect the cardiovascular response to MDMA. METHODS: The effects of the non-selective beta-blocker pindolol (20 mg) on the cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.6 mg/kg) were investigated in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 16 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Pindolol prevented MDMA-induced increases in heart rate. Peak values (mean+/-SD) for heart rate were 84+/-13 beats/min after MDMA vs 69+/-7 beats/min after pindolol-MDMA. In contrast, pindolol pretreatment had no effect on increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) after MDMA. Peak MAP values were 115+/-11 mm Hg after MDMA vs 114+/-11 mm Hg after pindolol-MDMA. Pindolol did not change adverse effects of MDMA. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that beta-blockers may prevent increases in heart rate but not hypertensive and adverse effects of MDMA."}

[Geretsegger, C., Bitterlich, W., Stelzig, R., Stuppaeck, C., Bondy, B. and Aichhorn, W. (2008) Paroxetine with Pindolol augmentation: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in depressed in-patients. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 18, 141-146.] have found that never-medicated depressed patients showed a significant sustained response with Paroxetine + Pindolol treatment. Also, patients with a first depressive episode displayed a trend for higher sustained response rates with Pindolol co-administration. Re-analysing the data of a previous clinical trial of Fluoxetine + Pindolol [P\u00e9rez, V., Gilaberte, I., Faries, D., Alvarez, E. and Artigas, F. (1997). Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of Pindolol in combination with Fluoxetine antidepressant treatment. Lancet 349, 1594-1597.], we have found that first depressive episodes are associated with a significant higher percentage of sustained responses when administering Fluoxetine + Pindolol (70.3%) compared to Fluoxetine + Placebo (44%). Moreover, based on a survival analysis, among the patients with a first depressive episode, those who received Fluoxetine + Pindolol achieved a sustained response significantly earlier (19 days) than those on Fluoxetine + Placebo (35 days). Interestingly, none of these effects were observed in the subsample of recurrent patients. The results suggest that Pindolol augmentation accelerates and enhances the action of SSRI at the beginning of the illness."}

Pindolol is a representative of this type of compound, either from the structural point of view, or as reference for comparison of the pharmacokinetic properties of the beta-blockers. A study of the pindolol structure based on infrared spectroscopy and natural bond orbital (NBO) theory is the main aim of the present research. FTIR spectra of the solid pindolol were recorded from 4000 to 400cm(-1), at temperatures between 25 and -170 degrees C. For spectral interpretation, the theoretical vibrational spectra of the conformer present in the solid was obtained at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. NBO analysis of the reference conformer, before and after optimization, was carried out at the same level of theory referred above. Characteristic absorption vibrational bands of the spectra of solid pindolol and of the isolated conformer were identified. Intra- and intermolecular interactions in pindolol were confirmed by the frequency shift of the vibrational modes and by the NBO theory. A detailed molecular picture of pindolol and of its intermolecular interactions was obtained from spectroscopy and NBO theory. The combination of both methods gives a deeper insight into the structure."}

Following this, the rats were treated topically with Temovate (corticosteroid) for an additional 15 days. At the end of the treatment period, superficial abrasion wounds were induced in the treated skin. Abrasion wounds healed more slowly in the skin of Temovate-treated rats than in skin of control animals. Healing was more rapid in skin of rats that had been pretreated with either curcumin or ginger extract alone or with the combination of curcumin-ginger extract (along with Temovate) than in the skin of rats treated with Temovate and vehicle alone. Skin samples were obtained at the time of wound closure. Collagen production was increased and matrix metalloproteinase-9 production was decreased in the recently healed skin from rats treated with the botanical preparation relative to rats treated with Temovate plus vehicle. In none of the rats was there any indication of skin irritation during the treatment phase or during wounding and repair. Taken together, these data suggest that a combination of curcumin and ginger extract might provide a novel approach to improving structure and function in skin and, concomitantly, reducing formation of nonhealing wounds in \"at-risk\" skin."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "PADMA 28 is a multi-component herbal mixture formulated according to an ancient Tibetan recipe. PADMA 28 is known to stimulate collagen production and reduced levels of collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The goal of the present study was to determine whether topical treatment of rat skin with PADMA 28 would improve skin structure/function, and whether subsequently induced abrasion wounds would heal more rapidly in skin that had been pretreated with PADMA 28. Hairless rats were exposed to a potent topical corticosteroid (Temovate) in combination with either DMSO alone or with PADMA 28 given topically. At the end of the treatment period, superficial wounds were created in the skin, and time to wound closure was assessed. Collagen production and matrix-degrading MMPs were assessed. Abrasion wounds in skin that had been pretreated with PADMA 28 healed more rapidly than did wounds in Temovate plus DMSO-treated skin. Under conditions in which improved wound healing was observed, there was an increased collagen production and decreased MMP expression, but no significant epidermal hyperplasia and no evidence of skin irritation. The ability to stimulate collagen production and inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and facilitate more rapid wound closure without irritation should provide a rationale for development of the herbal preparation as a \"skin-repair\" agent."}

Both properties influence the penetration process, as does the vehicle. It determines the penetration pathway and the retention time of the topically applied substances. METHODS: Two commercial products (Temovate Cream and Temovate Emollient), both containing 0.05% clobetasol propionate, were applied on the inner forearms of healthy volunteers. 20 tape strips were removed from each treated skin area. The horny layer profile was determined measuring the absorption of the corneocytes at 430 nm. The concentration of clobetasol propionate on the individual tapes was then analyzed. RESULTS: We found differences in the reservoir formation depending on the formulation applied, which correlated to the biological response in the form of a blanching effect. CONCLUSIONS: The method applied is well-suited to determine the reservoir formation in the stratum corneum for topically applied substances."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "Topical clobetasol propionate is widely used for the treatment of psoriasis. One formulation of clobetasol propionate, Skin Cap, was thought by some practitioners and patients to be more effective than other formulations. Differences in corticosteroid bioavailability could account for differences in efficacy. The purpose of this study is to compare the relative bioavailability of clobetasol propionate from Skin Cap to two FDA-approved formulations of clobetasol propionate (Olux foam and Temovate scalp application). The bioavailability was assessed by measuring the percutaneous absorption of clobetasol propionate in vitro on scalp skin, using the human cadaver skin model. There was no significant difference in the percutaneous absorption of clobetasol propionate between Olux foam and Skin Cap (2.09 and 1.93% at 48 h, respectively) or between Olux foam and Temovate scalp application (3.70 and 3.46%, respectively) when applied under unoccluded conditions. Under occluded conditions, there was greater absorption of clobetasol propionate from the Olux foam as compared with Skin Cap (4.94 and 1.57%, respectively; p < 0.05). The Skin Cap vehicle does not provide more bioavailable clobetasol propionate than currently available, FDA-approved products. Other differences, including those in patient compliance, could account for the perceived efficacy of the product."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "Tape-stripping and optical spectroscopy are used as a suitable combined method to determine the horny layer profile. Firstly, typical ultraviolet filter substances are used as active substances which are fixed inside the horny layer. Secondly, clobetasol propionate was applied topically in two formulations, Temovate Cream and Temovate and Emollient. The measured changes in the local distribution of the drug inside stratum corneum reflect the observed differences in the biological response visualized as blanching. The concentration of the drug in deeper parts of the horny layer proposes the existence of a small channel available for the percutaneous absorption. The observed low intensity blanching is correlated to the follicle orifices of the skin. After application of Temovate and Emollient, a lateral spreading of the drug must be taken into account."}

After application of Clobetasol Propionate Cream USP, 0.05%, and Temovate Cream, 0.05%, identical amounts of the drug were found in the stratum corneum, whereas after application of Temovate epsilon Emollient, 0.05%, the quantity was clearly decreased. From results obtained measuring the drug concentration in the adjacent sites of the skin where the creams had not been applied, it became clear that clobetasol propionate in Temovate epsilon Emollient, migrated to a large extent in the lateral direction. This explains the lower concentration measured for this formulation in the skin areas where the cream had been applied. In general, a lateral distribution of the applied drug must be taken into account when positioning the application areas on the forearm."}

After open application of a high potency steroid, we monitored atrophogenicity by a variety of non-invasive methods. METHODS: Volar forearms were treated twice daily for 3 or 4 weeks, with clobetasol propionate cream (Temovate). The following methods were used: 1) confocal microscopy, 2) transepidermal water loss (TEWL), 3) dimethyl sulfoxide whealing, 4) sodium hydroxide erosions, 5) analysis of stratum corneum lipids, and 6) B-scan ultrasound. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy revealed thinning of the epidermis, decreased microvasculature and decreased size of keratinocytes. Evaporimetry demonstrated transepidermal water loss. Whealing to dimethyl sulfoxide was enhanced. Sodium hydroxide erosions formed more quickly. The amount of ceramides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids was reduced. Ultrasound showed thinning of the dermis. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive methods are very useful for quantifying the atrophogenicity of topical corticosteroids."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "The present study assesses the applicability of human skin-SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mouse chimeras in testing antipsoriatic therapeutics. Three agents were examined: (1) a monoclonal antibody to the alpha subunit of leukocyte function associated antigen-1 integrin (CD11a); (2) Cyclosporin A; and (3) clobetasol propionate (Temovate), a potent topical corticosteroid used clinically in the treatment of psoriasis. Skin transplanted to SCID mice from normal human volunteers or from psoriatic lesional skin was allowed to heal for 3 to 5 weeks before application of test reagents. During this period, psoriatic skin, which was 3.8-fold thicker than the corresponding normal skin before transplantation, maintained its phenotype (ie, increased epidermal thickness, rete ridges with blunted ends, and intralesional presence of T lymphocytes). Transplanted normal human skin, however, underwent a hyperplastic response during this period, resulting in a 2.4-fold increase in epidermal thickness. After the healing period, animals transplanted with normal or psoriatic skin were treated for 14 days by daily intraperitoneal injection of either Cyclosporin A or a monoclonal antibody to human CD11a, or by topical application of clobetasol propionate. At the end of the treatment period, the mice were killed and the tissue evaluated morphometrically for changes in epidermal thickness and immunohistologically for the presence of T lymphocytes. Both Cyclosporin A and anti-CD11a reduced the epidermal thickness of transplanted psoriatic skin, whereas neither reagent significantly reduced the thickness of transplanted normal skin. T lymphocytes were detected in the skin from treated animals; there did not seem to be any reduction in the number of T lymphocytes. Clobetasol propionate reduced the epidermal thickness of both normal and psoriatic skin. These data indicate that, in this model, therapies directed against pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to psoriasis can be distinguished from treatments that block epidermal hyperplasia occurring as a consequence of xenografting. Our observations provide evidence for the activity of anti-CD11a in an animal model of human psoriasis."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND DESIGN: A homozygous line of transgenic mice that expresses the human elastin promoter/CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene construct in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner is presented. Previous studies have shown that subcutaneous injections of various glucocorticosteroids up-regulate the human transgene in the mouse skin potentially through their interaction with three putative glucocorticosteroid-responsive elements contained within the human elastin promoter. In this study, we propose the use of these transgenic mice as a model system for assaying the potency of various topical glucocorticosteroid preparations. RESULTS: In the first set of experiments, three different commercially available topical glucocorticosteroid creams, 2.5% Hytone (2.5% hydrocortisone) (Dermik Laboratories, Fort Washington, Pa), Cutivate (0.05% fluticasone propionate) (Glaxo Inc, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Temovate (0.05% clobetasol propionate) (Glaxo Inc) (being classified into class VII, V, and I steroids, respectively) were applied to the skin of transgenic mice, with Eucerin (Beiersdorf Inc, Lindenhurst, NY) as the control cream. In a series of six experiments, Hytone 2.5% cream caused a 3.1-fold increase on the average, with Cutivate and Temovate creams resulting in 2.2-fold and 12.4-fold increases in CAT activity over control, respectively. Next, two different preparations of diflorasone diacetate 0.05% cream (Florone [class III] and Psorcon [class II], both from Dermik Laboratories), formulated with different vehicles, were compared. Psorcon caused a 22.8-fold increase in CAT activity over the control compared with a 4.4-fold increase for Florone. However, an assay comparing Psorcon ointment (class I) and Psorcon cream (class II) showed no statistically significant difference in their potencies. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest the usefulness of these transgenic mice as a model system for assaying the potency of topical glucocorticosteroid preparations. Discrepancies between our data and the published classification of some topical steroids may result from anatomic differences between human and murine skin, with mouse skin much thinner, Alternatively, the discrepancies may reflect the fact that our assay measures the biological activity of these steroids on gene transcription, while previous ranking is based on their vasoconstrictive activity."}
{"keyword": "Temovate", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Hemangiomas pose a therapeutic challenge because they can threaten vision in infancy and early childhood. Intralesional injection of corticosteroid is widely regarded as the treatment of choice for hemangiomas which induce strabismus or significant refractive error, or occlude the visual axis. Ocular and systemic complications such as eyelid necrosis, central retinal artery occlusion, and adrenal suppression have been reported rarely after corticosteroid injection. METHODS: Three infants were treated with clobetasol propionate (Temovate) cream for vision-threatening eyelid hemangiomas. RESULTS: Treatment with this topical fluorinated corticosteroid produced a measurable reduction in the size of the hemangiomas, which permitted clearing of the visual axis. No regional side effects were noted. In addition, the patients did not demonstrate evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment modality appears to provide an additional alternative for managing superficial periocular hemangiomas which threaten vision."}

METHOD: In this multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, children 6 to 12 years of age with ADHD were randomized to receive GXR (1-4 mg/d) in the morning and placebo in the evening (GXR am), placebo in the morning and GXR in the evening (GXR pm), or twice-daily placebo. The primary efficacy measure was the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV). RESULTS: A total of 333 child participants received study drug in the following cohorts: GXR am (n = 107), GXR pm (n = 114), or placebo (n = 112). Mean (standard deviation) changes from baseline to week 8 (visit 10 or last observation carried forward) in ADHD-RS-IV total scores were significant for both GXR treatment groups combined (GXR all-active: -20.0 [12.97]) and separately (GXR am: -19.8 [12.95]; GXR pm: -20.1 [13.04]) compared with placebo (-11.0 [12.93]; p < .001 for all). Most spontaneously-elicited treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate in severity; the most common was somnolence (GXR all-active: 44.3%; GXR am: 46.7%; GXR pm: 42.1%; placebo: 12.5%). CONCLUSIONS: GXR administered either in the morning or evening was associated with significant and clinically meaningful improvements in ADHD symptoms. The levels of response and tolerability observed with GXR were similar regardless of time of dosing (morning versus evening), indicating that once-daily GXR monotherapy is effective whether administered in the morning or evening.

{"keyword": "Magnesium Sulfate", "texts": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a drug safety communication on 05/30/2013 recommending \"against prolonged use of magnesium sulfate to stop preterm labor (PTL) due to bone changes in exposed babies.\" In September of 2013, The American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecologists issued Committee Opinion No. 573 \" Magnesium Sulfate Use in Obstetrics\" , which supports the short term use of MgSO4 to prolong pregnancy (up to 48 hrs.) to allow for the administration of antenatal corticosteroids.\" Are these pronouncements by respected organizations short sighted and will potentially result in more harm than good? The FDA safety communication focuses on bone demineralization (a few cases with fractures) with prolonged administration of MgSO4 (beyond 5-7 days). It cites 18 case reports in the Adverse Event Reporting System with an average duration of magnesium exposure of 9.6 weeks (range 8-12 wks). Other epidemiologic studies showed transient changes in bone density which resolved in the short duration of follow up. Interestingly, the report fails to acknowledge the fact that these 18 fetuses were in danger of PTD and the pregnancy was prolonged by 9.6 weeks (e.g. extending 25 weeks to 34.6 wks), thus significantly reducing mortality and morbidity. Evidence does support the efficacy of MgSO4 as a tocolytic medication. The decision to use magnesium, the dosage to administer, the duration of use, and alternative therapies are physician judgments. These decisions should be made based on a reasonable assessment of the risks of the clinical situation (PTL) and the treatments available versus the benefits of significantly prolonging pregnancy."}

{"keyword": "Magnesium Sulfate", "texts": "Post-operative pain control is an important concern for both patients and physicians. Magnesium is being used as an adjuvant for anesthesia and analgesia during and after various surgeries. We aimed to investigate the effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate on post-operative analgesia after laminectomy. Methods Materials: In this randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial, we enrolled 40 adult patients aged 18-60 with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) \u00a0Class I-II who were candidates for elective laminectomy. The patients were randomly assigned in two control groups and were similarly anesthetized. In the case group, after the induction of anesthesia, a loading dose of magnesium sulfate (30 mg/kg) was administered within five to 10 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg/hr up to the end of the surgery; while, the patients in the control group received the same volume of saline. After the surgery, all patients received a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA) pump containing morphine. The first time of using PCA, the amount of consumed morphine during the first 24 hours, and pain score were recorded at 6,12,18 and 24 hours in the post-operative period.There was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the amount of morphine consumed\u00a0in 24 hours after the surgery (P value =0.23), the first time of using of PCA pump (P value =0.79) and pain intensity (P value=0.52).The infusion of Magnesium Sulfate during laminectomy had no effect on patients' pain and opioid requirement during the first 24 hours after the surgery."}
