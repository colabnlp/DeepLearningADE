{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "Locally applied nitroglycerin [nitric oxide (NO) donor] and iloprost (analog of prostacyclin PGI2) improve regional gastric oxygenation and nitroglycerin preserves gastric mucosal barrier integrity. This suggests direct effects of these substances on oxygenation and barrier function. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of iloprost and nitroglycerin on intestinal mitochondrial function and on mucosal barrier function in vitro. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption (respirometry) was determined in colon homogenates from 16 healthy rats before (baseline) and 15 min after incubation with nitroglycerin (25 and 250 \u03bcg/ml) and iloprost (0.1 and 1 \u03bcg/ml). State 2 (substrate-dependent oxygen consumption) and state 3 respiration (ADP-dependent oxygen consumption) were assessed and ADP/O ratio (ADP added/oxygen consumed) for complex I and II were calculated. For permeability measurement we used the Caco-2 monolayer. Fluorescein sulfonic acid (FS) (200 \u03bcg/ml) and the drugs were administered into the apical compartment of the transwell chamber. After 48 h, FS translocation was assessed as basolateral/apical FS. Both concentrations of nitroglycerin and iloprost reduced state 3 by stimulation via both complexes. Iloprost increased ADP/O ratio after stimulation via both complexes at both concentrations. Nitroglycerin increased ADP/O ratio at the higher concentration (250 \u03bcg/ml) after stimulation via complex I and at the lower concentration (25 \u03bcg/ml) via complex II. Neither nitroglycerin nor iloprost influenced FS translocation. Iloprost and nitroglycerin reduce the maximal mitochondrial respiration and improve the efficacy of oxidative phosphorylation in colon homogenates. Both drugs have no direct influence on mucosal barrier integrity of Caco-2 monolayers."}

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "AIMS:Nitroglycerin (or glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) has been long considered an endothelium-independent vasodilator because GTN vasodilation is intact in the absence of the endothelium and in the presence of endothelial dysfunction. However, in animal and in vitro models, GTN has been shown to stimulate the release of certain endothelium-derived vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin (PGI2 ). In addition, chronic GTN therapy leads to endothelial dysfunction. In this series of experiments, we explored how GTN might interact with the vascular endothelium in normal humans, without cardiovascular disease or risk factors associated with abnormalities in vascular function. METHODS:We examined the effect of inhibition of NO, PGI2 , and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs, a class of endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor) on GTN-mediated vasodilation. We measured arterial blood flow responses to brachial artery infusions of GTN in the absence and presence of L-NMMA (n\u00a0=\u00a013), ketorolac (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and fluconazole (n\u00a0=\u00a016), which are inhibitors of endothelium-derived NO, PGI2 and EETs, respectively, in healthy volunteers. RESULTS:Our results demonstrate that inhibition of endothelium-dependent vasodilator mechanisms does not alter forearm resistance vessel responses to GTN. CONCLUSION:We conclude that GTN-mediated dilation of forearm resistance vessels is largely independent of vascular endothelium."}

Nitroglycerin ointment has been shown to reduce the incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis in a randomized controlled study, using 45 g per breast and treating one side only in bilateral cases. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of 15 g of nitroglycerin ointment per breast, therefore permitting application to both breasts in cases of bilateral mastectomy. METHODS:A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction performed by a single reconstructive surgeon was conducted. The intervention cohort consisted of all patients between June 10, 2015, and June 9, 2016 (94 patients, 158 breasts), where 15 g of nitroglycerin ointment was routinely applied per breast. The control cohort consisted of all patients from June 10, 2014, to June 9, 2015 (107 patients, 170 breasts), where nitroglycerin was not applied. All complications were tracked, including minor wound healing problems. RESULTS:There was an overall 22 percent decreased incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis in the nitroglycerin ointment cohort (47.5 percent versus 60.6 percent; p = 0.002), with a 44 percent reduction in full-thickness mastectomy flap necrosis that trended toward statistical significance (9.5 percent versus 16.5 percent; p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis, nitroglycerin application was independently associated with a decrease in mastectomy flap necrosis or need for mastectomy flap d\u00e9bridement. There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative hypotension (3.8 percent versus 2.9 percent) or headache among cohorts. CONCLUSION:Topical nitroglycerin ointment application to mastectomy skin flaps at 15 g per breast is a cost-effective means of decreasing the incidence of mastectomy flap necrosis in unilateral and bilateral immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction.

Due to the unpredictable nature of these attacks, pharmacologic agents that can be administered on as-needed basis are currently being sought after. Topical nitrates are well suited for as-needed use, and several different formulations have been studied for the treatment of RP, including ointments, gels, patches, and tapes. However, these different dosage forms are not all equal in terms of safety and efficacy, and not every one is commercially available for use in clinical practice. Nitroglycerin ointment is commercially available, and it has less systemic side effects than other topical formulations. Since its role in the treatment of RP has not yet been completely established, we performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to evaluate its safety and efficacy. A total of 1125 studies were identified, and 7 were included in our review. Although the included studies used different measures of efficacy, the majority reported positive responses to nitroglycerin ointment.

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "AbstractBackgroundBlood stream infections due to Candida auris is a significant public health concern due to increased patient mortality, frequent misidentification, and high rates of antifungal resistance. C. auris is known to be azole resistant, however several strains have been identified with elevated MICs to all classes of antifungals. Current treatment options for a pan-resistant strain of C. auris would be extremely challenging. Previously we have shown that non-antibiotic, Nitroglycerine + Citrate + Ethanol (NiCE) lock solution was highly efficacious in eradicating various species of multi-drug-resistant Candida. In this study we compared the efficacy of NiCE with standard of care antifungals commonly used in lock solutions in eradicating C. auris biofilms.MethodsBiofilm eradication of C. auris was evaluated in 10 strains. Candida auris biofilm was grown on silicone discs for 24 hours. Discs were then washed to remove any non-adherent organisms and exposed for 2 hours to various antifungal lock solutions including NiCE, Echinocandins, Azoles, and Amphotericin B. Discs were exposed to Muller\u2013Hinton broth as a control. Subsequently discs were sonicated for 15 minutes in 5 mL of saline and quantitatively cultured onto sabouraud dextrose agar. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours and counted for growth. All testing was conducted with 6 replicates.ResultsNiCE and Caspofungin were significantly more effective in eradicating C. auris biofilms compared with control (P = 0.002 and 0.008, respectively). However, Caspofungin failed to eradicate a few strains of C. auris biofilm while NiCE completely eradicated all 10 strains. Micafungin, Anidulafungin, Fluconazole, and Voriconazole were not significantly different than control (P > 0.05) for all strains.ConclusionNiCE catheter lock solution was capable of completely eradicating all C. auris biofilms within 2 hours indicating high potential for preventing CRBSI caused by C. auris. Caspofungin eradicated some strains of C. auris biofilm, but failed to eradicate all. Other commonly used antifungals were no different than control. Future clinical studies to verify these findings need to be conducted.Disclosures D. P.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of reflexology massage on intravenous NTG-induced headache in coronary care unit (CCU) inpatients. METHODS:This was a randomized clinical trial. The study sample included 75 patients that were randomly divided into three groups: control, intervention, and placebo groups. The intensity of baseline headache in patients who received NTG was measured by the numeric rating scale for pain (NRS Pain). Patients in the intervention group received reflexology massage two times for 20 min (at 3-h interval), wherein the upper part of patient's both foot thumbs, which is the reflection point of the head, was massaged. In the placebo group, an unspecified point on the foot (heel), which was not related to the head, was massaged. Patients in the control group did not receive any massage. RESULTS:No baseline differences existed among the three groups for the mean pain scale score (p=0.66) before the study; but the difference between the groups after the application was statistically significant (p=0.000).

Nitroglycerin and remifentanil are among the drugs used to induce controlled hypotension.The aim of our study was to compare the hemodynamic effects of remifentanil and nitroglycerin in this patient population. METHODS:All consecutive patients who underwent middle ear surgery between January and December 2016, at the University Hospital Vittorio Emanuele in Catania were included in a retrospective study. Patients who were given nitroglycerin to induce controlled hypotension were compared to those given remifentanil. The following parameters were measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral (capillary) oxygen saturation, and fraction of expired carbon dioxide. A mean arterial pressure of 50-70 mmHg was considered optimal. RESULTS:Thirty patients who underwent stapedioplasty and tympanoplasty, 25 men and 5 women,with a mean age of 43 years (range 32-58 years) were included in the study. Fifteen patients had received nitroglycerin (group A) and 15 patients remifentanil (group B). The target blood pressure was reached in all patients and no significant difference was found between the groups with regard to the level of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral (capillary) oxygen saturation, and fraction of expired carbon dioxide. However the heart rate of 2 younger patients in group A rose to > 100 bpm after the administration of nitroglycerin. CONCLUSION:Both remifentanil and nitroglycerin are effective in inducing controlled hypotension. In younger patients administration of nitroglycerin is associated with an increase in heart rate.

We focused on the four molds (Aspergillus, Fusarium, Mucorales, Scedosporium) that account for the vast majority of cIMIs in our patient population.ResultsNo changes in cIMI rates (0.184 pre-Harvey vs. 0.171 post\u2013Harvey, P = NS) and mold distribution as causes of cIMIs were seen (table). No increased cases of cIMIs were encountered amongst different services (table), including patients with lymphoma/multiple myeloma or solid tumors (40% pre-Harvey vs. 31% post-Harvey, P = NS).ConclusionDespite concerns for extensive environmental mold exposure after hurricane Harvey, we did not detect increased rates of cIMIs nor the emergence of unusual molds as causes of IMIs in high-risk cancer patients at MDACC, including in patients with solid tumors, where mold-active prophylaxis is not used. Whether excess IMI cases not fitting the traditional diagnostic criteria (e.g., biomarker-positive but culture-negative IMIs) or pneumonias not requiring hospitalization were seen, requires further study.

In addition, the role of anticoagulation in the management of septic thrombosis remains unclear. We herein studied the clinical characteristics of staphylococcus aureus catheter-related septic thrombosis as well as the appropriate management and duration of treatment.MethodsWe conducted this retrospective study where we included patients with CLABSI due to Staphylococcus aureus who had a concomitant radiographic evidence of thrombosis at the level of catheter placement between the years 2005 and 2017. We collected data pertaining to patients\u2019 medical history, clinical presentation, management, treatment and outcome within 3 months of bacteremia onset. Failure was defined as persistence of signs and symptoms at 72 hours, persistence bacteremia at 48\u201396 hours, relapse, complications or overall mortality.ResultsA total of 128 patients were included. The median age was 55 years. Total relapse/recurrence rate was 8% and all-cause mortality within 3 months was 16%. We found no significant difference in overall outcome between patients who had deep vs. superficial thrombosis. Patients with superficial thrombosis were found to have higher rate of pulmonary complications (25% vs. 6%; P = 0.01) compared with those with deep thrombosis. Patients who received less than 28 days of intravascular antibiotic therapy had higher all-cause mortality (31 vs. 5% P = 0.001). A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified two independent predictors of treatment failure: presence in the ICU at any point during their illness (odds ratio (OR) = 2.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08\u20136.99, P = 0.034) and not receiving anticoagulation (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.11\u20130.54, P < 0.001).ConclusionIntravenous antimicrobial therapy for 28 days or longer carries a survival advantage over shorter duration of therapy and anticoagulation as an adjunctive treatment is an independent predictor of successful antimicrobial therapy.Disclosures I.

In contrast, IPA is not well described in solid tumor patients.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed all Aspergillus-positive cultures at MD Anderson Cancer Center from March 2004 to September 2017. We included all adult patients with underlying solid tumor and Aspergillus-positive respiratory cultures. The clinical algorithm for IPA diagnosis in critically-ill patients was used to separate colonization from proven or probable infection. We analyzed the association between host factors, clinical findings, and treatment modalities and 12-week overall survival, and response to antifungal therapy.ResultsOut of 1,121 Aspergillus-positive cultures, 669 cases did not meet the inclusion criteria and 351 were classified as colonization. We included 101 patients with IPA and solid tumor; 10% proven and 90% probable IPA. The median age was 63 years. The most common underlying solid tumor was lung cancer (51%), 76% of the patients had an underlying lung disease, 47% had received radiation therapy to the chest, and 33% had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Neutropenia and diabetes were not common risk factors. Most patients presented with respiratory symptoms (81%). A. fumigatus was the most common type isolated (69%). Most common chest imaging findings were nodular (41%) and cavitary lesions (14%); 70% of the patients were treated with voriconazole monotherapy. Independent risk factors for 12-week mortality were receiving steroids within 30 days of IPA diagnosis (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% CI, 1.1\u20134.6; P = 0.03) and radiation therapy to the chest (hazard ratio 2.6, 95% CI, 1.2\u20135.5; P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, a positive calcofluor fungal stain was associated with lower odds of a successful outcome (odds ratio 0.2; 95% CI, 0.05\u20130.75; P = 0.02) whereas treatment with voriconazole was associated with higher odds (odds ratio 10.1; 95% CI, 2.1\u201348.5; P < 0.01).ConclusionIPA should be considered in solid tumor patients, particularly those with underlying lung disease.

Physicians often rely on natriuretic peptides, but the evidence behind their use is controversial, and these should not be used in isolation. Chest radiograph is often considered the most reliable imaging test, but bedside ultrasound (US) provides a more sensitive and specific evaluation for AHF. Diuretics are a foundation of AHF management, but in pulmonary edema, these medications should only be provided after vasodilator administration, such as nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin administered in high doses for pulmonary edema is safe and effective in reducing the need for intensive care unit admission. Though classically dopamine is the first vasopressor utilized in patients with hypotensive cardiogenic shock, norepinephrine is associated with improved outcomes and lower mortality. Disposition is complex in patients with AHF, and risk stratification tools in conjunction with other assessments allow physicians to discharge patients safely with follow up.A variety of misconceptions surround the evaluation and management of heart failure including clinical assessment, natriuretic peptide use, chest radiograph and US use, nitroglycerin and diuretics, vasopressor choice, and disposition.

We developed a second generation antimicrobial CVC with addition of chlorhexidine (CHD) for extended spectrum activity against virulent Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as yeast. In this study we examined the potential for induced resistance with repeated exposure to M/R+CHD.MethodsPotential to induce resistance was evaluated by exposing a broad-spectrum of CRBSI pathogens to serial passages of sub-inhibitory concentrations of M/R+CHD and retesting MICs following each passage. Susceptibility to individual agents in the combination were assessed, to identify organisms that were originally resistant to the individual agents in the combination. A total of 24 Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and yeast pathogens were evaluated for baseline MICs following standard CLSI procedures. Subsequently, organisms that were exposed to one half the MIC were cultured and MICs retested. This process was carried out for a total of 21 passages to assess trends in MICs and potential for induction of resistance. Any organism with \u22654 fold increase in MIC were then passed in broth alone to assess phenotypic adaptation.ResultsSynergy in the triple combination of M/R + CHD was detected for several resistant organisms that had low susceptibilities to the individual components but were highly susceptible to the combination. After a series of 21 passages, the organisms maintained the same MIC values as baseline with no clinically significant increases. One strain of Enterobacter showed a 4-fold MIC increase; however, the MIC returned to baseline after culturing in broth alone.ConclusionRepeated exposure of M/R + CHD failed to show induced antimicrobial resistance among a large number of pathogens with both low and high susceptibilities. Furthermore, any increase in MIC returned to baseline with the removal of the stressor (M/R + CHD), indicating that the increase in MIC was a phenotypic adaptation rather than induced resistance. Surveillance studies assessing development of resistance will need to be conducted in a clinical setting.Disclosures I.

This study investigated whether the presence of renal failure affects reactivity to nitroglycerin in internal thoracic arteries obtained from patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The patients were divided into three groups according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2): without renal failure (60\u00a0\u2264\u00a0eGFR, n\u00a0=\u00a013), with moderate renal failure (30\u00a0\u2264\u00a0eGFR\u00a0<\u00a060, n\u00a0=\u00a010), and with severe renal failure (eGFR\u00a0<\u00a030, n\u00a0=\u00a010). Organ chamber technique was used to evaluate concentration-related responses of isolated internal thoracic arteries to vasodilators. Nitroglycerin induced a concentration-dependent relaxation, which was significantly augmented in patients with severe but not moderate renal failure than in those without renal failure. In addition, there was a negative correlation between eGFR and the relaxant efficacy of nitroglycerin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016). On the other hand, relaxant responses to BAY 60-2770 (which enhances cGMP generation as with nitroglycerin) were similar among three grades of renal function. An inverse relationship of eGFR to the relaxant efficacy of BAY 60-2770 was not observed, either (P\u00a0=\u00a00.314). These findings suggest that severe renal failure specifically potentiates nitroglycerin-induced relaxation in internal thoracic artery grafts."}

We tested the hypothesis that the genetic characteristics of S. epidermidis isolated from blood cultures are significantly associated with disease severity using whole genome sequencing (WGS).MethodsWe performed WGS of 163 S. epidermidis isolates from a large prospective multicenter, randomized control trial that assessed the safety and efficacy of algorithm-based treatment of patients with staphylococcal bacteremia (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT01191840). Patient\u2019s infection types were divided into simple (including possible contamination), uncomplicated and complicated bacteremia. Failure was defined as persistent signs and symptoms of infection at 72 hours, persistent bacteremia at 7 days, relapse, complications or overall mortality within 28 days of therapy. WGS was performed using Illumina Miseq, followed by in silico multi-locus sequence type identification and phylogenomic analysis using kSNP.ResultsOf the 163 isolates analyzed, 39 sequence types (STs) were identified with ST2 and ST5 isolates being most frequently identified (21% and 20%, respectively). ST2 and ST5 isolates were significantly more likely associated with uncomplicated and complicated infections rather than simple bacteremia (P = 0.01 by \u03c72 test). By multivariate regression analysis, having an ST2 or ST5 S. epidermidis bacteremia was an independent predictor of a complicated infection (odds ratio 4.28, 95% CI 1.36\u201313.42). Using WGS based branching points rather than sequence typing allowed for additional strengthening of the association of S. epidermidis genetic clustering and clinical infection types (figure). Although there was no significant difference in failure rates among patients infected with different STs, ST2/ST5 strains were significantly more likely to cause relapsing infections (85.7%, P = 0.02).ConclusionWGS could offer a prognostic tool in the management of S. epidermidis bacteremia. ST2 and ST5 strains may help predict a complicated bacteremia course which would warrant appropriate antimicrobial therapy.  Disclosures T. L. Holland, Basilea: Consultant, Consulting fee.

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "Background Nitric oxide (NO) has been heavily implicated in migraine. Nitroglycerin is a prototypic NO-donor, and triggers migraine in humans. However, nitroglycerin also induces oxidative/nitrosative stress and is a source of peroxynitrite - factors previously linked with migraine etiology. Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is the high affinity NO receptor in the body, and the aim of this study was to identify the precise role of sGC in acute and chronic migraine. Methods We developed a novel brain-bioavailable sGC stimulator (VL-102), and tested its hyperalgesic properties in mice. We also determined the effect of VL-102 on c-fos and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) immunoreactivity within the trigeminovascular complex. In addition, we also tested the known sGC inhibitor, ODQ, within the chronic nitroglycerin migraine model. Results VL-102-evoked acute and chronic mechanical cephalic and hind-paw allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, which was blocked by the migraine medications sumatriptan, propranolol, and topiramate. In addition, VL-102 also increased c-fos and CGRP expressing cells within the trigeminovascular complex. Importantly, ODQ completely inhibited acute and chronic hyperalgesia induced by nitroglycerin. ODQ also blocked hyperalgesia already established by chronic nitroglycerin, implicating this pathway in migraine chronicity. Conclusions These results indicate that nitroglycerin causes migraine-related pain through stimulation of the sGC pathway, and that super-activation of this receptor may be an important component for the maintenance of chronic migraine. This work opens the possibility for negative sGC modulators as novel migraine therapies."}

Patients receiving PN are at increased risk for both infectious and noninfectious catheter complications often leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Risk factors for catheter complications in patients receiving PN are often variable and poorly understood.MethodsWe conducted retrospective study among cancer patients who received PN between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Rate and prevalence of central line associated blood stream infection (CLABSI) and noninfectious catheter complications were assessed. Additionally, prevalence and time-to-infection of causative pathogens were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted in a sample of the PN population to identify risk factors for both infectious and noninfectious catheter complications.ResultsWe identified 46 CLABSI cases in 38 patients of the 1,762 patients receiving PN (1.73 episodes of CLABSI per 1000 PN days). Gram-positives (37.84%) and yeast (29.73%) were the most common pathogens, with catheter-related Candidemias occurring earlier than gram-positive or gram-negative CLABSI. Noninfectious catheter complications occurred in 56 patients (38.6%). Multivariate analysis identified age, GVHD, and history of occlusion in the same catheter, as well as intestinal failure and long-term PN use as significant risk factors for CLABSI and noninfectious catheter complications, respectively.ConclusionPatients receiving PN are at higher risk for both infectious and noninfectious catheter complications. Compared with national averages of CLABSI, the prevalence of catheter-related Candidemias in the PN cancer patient population was increased. This study highlights the need for development of more effective targeted preventative interventions.Disclosures J.

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "AbstractBackgroundCatheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a significant medical issue with substantial morbidities and costs. CAUTIs are primarily caused by colonization of the external surface of Foley catheters which serve as conduits for colonizing microbes to access the bladder. In order to prevent these CAUTIs, we developed a double-cuff Foley catheter with a novel irrigation cuff for daily irrigation of the periurethral space with a biocompatible antimicrobial disinfecting solution. This study assessed the efficacy of this system for reducing external-surface microbial colonization of catheters in an in vitro model.MethodsThe novel double cuff Foley and disinfectant solutions were evaluated in an established in vitro CAUTI model (Gaonkar, et al 2003) where a Foley catheter indwelled in a simulated urethra. 5.5 \u00d7 105 CFU of common uropathogens (MRSA, E. coli, C. albicans) were allowed to attach to the external catheter surface at meatal end of the catheter for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, 3 mL of disinfectant solutions were instilled through the irrigation cuff and covered the periurethral catheter surfaces. Catheters were then incubated an additional 24\u201348 hours at 37\u00b0C, removed, cut into segments, and adherent organisms were quantified by sonication. Disinfectant solutions evaluated included various combinations of 1% polygalacturonic acid (PG), 0.4% caprylic acid (CAP) and (dilute) 0.3% H2O2.ResultsFor all organisms tested only the triple combination periurtehral flush (PG+CAP+H2O2) completely prevented biofilm colonization of catheters indicating antimicrobial synergy of the component agents. Control catheters grew >104 CFU/segment. Single agent or double agents combinations were only partially effective in preventing colonization by all three pathogens.ConclusionThe PG + CAP + H2O2 periurethral disinfectant flush instilled through an irrigation cuff in a novel double-cuff Foley catheter was able to completely prevent microbial colonization of the external catheter surface by MRSA, E. coli and C. albicans in an in vitro CAUTI model. In vivo studies are needed to further evaluate this technology for prevention of CAUTI.Disclosures J.

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "AbstractBackgroundCurrent IDSA guidelines mandate removal and re-insertion of Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) in the setting of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) caused by virulent pathogens. However, CVC may be retained in the setting of non-CLABSI. There has been little if any quantitative assessment of the symptom burden associated with CVC removal and insertion.MethodsBetween 2013 and 2014, we evaluated the rate of CVC removal in 283 cancer patients who presented at our institution with a bloodstream infection (BSI) in the presence of a CVC whereby the positive blood cultures were drawn from the CVC and peripheral vein. In 2015, we collected symptom burden related to CVC removal and insertion procedures in 60 consecutive cancer patients using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory.ResultsThe rate of CVC removal in patients with BSI and other non-CVC source was 57% which was identical to that in patients with CLABSI. (P = 0.94). In the 60 patients evaluated for symptom burden, symptoms (such as pain, pressure, distress) were present in up to 57% to 67% of patients undergoing CVC insertion and removal respectively. In 32% of patients, moderate to severe symptoms were reported with a symptom burden level of 4/10 or\u00a0more.ConclusionCVC removal occurred unnecessarily in 57% of non-CLABSI patients which was equivalent to that in patients with CLABSI. Catheter removal and insertion produced moderate to severe symptom burden in cancer patients. Physician education need to be reinforced and safe interventions to salvage the vascular access should be explored.Disclosures J.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether locally applied iloprost or nitroglycerin influence gastric mucosal perfusion, oxygenation, and barrier function during physiological and hemorrhagic conditions.In repeated experiments, 5 anesthetized dogs received iloprost, nitroglycerin, or normal saline during physiological and hemorrhagic (-20% blood volume) conditions. Macro- and microcirculatory variables were recorded continuously. Gastric barrier function was assessed via translocation of sucrose into the blood.During hemorrhage, gastric mucosal oxygenation decreased from 77 \u00b1 4 to 37 \u00b1 7%. This effect was attenuated by nitroglycerin (78 \u00b1 6 to 47 \u00b1 13%) and iloprost (82 \u00b1 4 to 54 \u00b1 9%). Sucrose plasma levels increased during hemorrhage from 7 \u00b1 4 to 55 \u00b1 15 relative amounts. This was alleviated by nitroglycerin (5 \u00b1 8 to 29 \u00b1 38 relative amounts). These effects were independent of systemic hemodynamic variables.During hemorrhage, topical nitroglycerin and iloprost improve regional gastric oxygenation without affecting perfusion. Nitroglycerin attenuated the shock-induced impairment of the mucosal barrier integrity. Thus, local drug application improves gastric microcirculation without compromising systemic hemodynamic variables, and it may also protect mucosal barrier function."}

On the other hand, nitroglycerin-induced relaxation of endothelium-denuded arteries was significantly attenuated by hypoxia. Similarly, the relaxant response of endothelium-intact monkey coronary arteries to nitroglycerin was not affected by hypoxia, whereas that of endothelium-denuded arteries was impaired. As is the case with rabbit and monkey coronary arteries, exposure to hypoxia resulted in impaired relaxation by nitroglycerin in endothelium-denuded but not endothelium-intact porcine coronary arteries.These findings suggest that coronary endothelium plays a pivotal role in preventing the hypoxia-induced impairment of nitroglycerin responsiveness, regardless of the animal species."}

{"keyword": "Nitroglycerin", "texts": "The feasibility of detecting explosives in the atmosphere at concentrations as low as 0.01 ppq hinges on the poorly known question of what interfering species exist at these or higher concentrations. To clarify the issue, hundreds of samples of ambient air, either clean or loaded with explosives (from lightly contaminated environments) have been collected in fiberglass/stainless steel filters coated with Tenax-GR, thermally desorbed at variable temperature, and ionized with Cl- via secondary electrospray (SESI). They are analyzed with a narrow-band mobility filter (SEADM's P5 DMA) and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex's 5500), configured in series to transmit precursor and fragment ions of the explosives Nitroglycerin, PETN, RDX, and TNT. Blanks were sampled outdoors at a rural site (Boecillo, Valladolid, Spain), and loads were sampled at diverse locations. For RDX and TNT, atmospheric background inhibits detection below 1 part/trillion (ppt) without mobility filtering. This interference was drastically reduced by the DMA, allowing detection up to 1 part/quadrillion (ppq). Further sensitivity increase was achieved by scanning over a mobility region several percent around that of the target explosive, to separate various isobaric compounds by Gaussian deconvolution. (i) All four MS/MS channels analyzed exhibit several background peaks within the narrow mobility intervals investigated. At least one of these interferents is much stronger than the instrument background at the explosive's mobility, making DMA separation most helpful. (ii) For Nitroglycerin and PETN the combined filtering techniques have not lowered ambient chemical noise down to 0.01 ppq. (iii) Interferents are greatly reduced for TNT and RDX, resulting in minimal chemical noise: 322 blank tests for RDX yielded mean signal of 0.0012 ppq and standard deviation \u03c3 = 0.0035 ppq (mean + 3\u03c3 detection limit of 0.01 ppq)."}

{"keyword": "Glycopyrrolate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Effective delivery of inhaled drugs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) depends on patients' ability to correctly use an inhalation device. Nebulized delivery may be appropriate for COPD patients who cannot coordinate breath with inhalation or generate adequate inhalational force. Until recently, long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), used for maintenance treatment of COPD, were available for delivery only via handheld inhalers. Lonhala\u2122 Magnair\u2122 (glycopyrrolate inhalation solution) is a LAMA delivered via the eFlow\u00ae closed-system (eFlow CS) vibrating membrane nebulizer. We assessed patient-reported ease of use and satisfaction with the eFlow CS nebulizer in the GOLDEN (Glycopyrrolate for Obstructive Lung Disease via Electronic Nebulizer)-5 study. METHODS:GOLDEN-5, a phase 3, randomized, open-label trial, evaluated the safety and efficacy of glycopyrrolate/eFlow CS 50\u2009\u03bcg twice daily versus tiotropium 18\u2009\u03bcg once daily (administered via HandiHaler\u2122) in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD. Only patients in the glycopyrrolate/eFlow CS group completed a study-specific device use questionnaire, evaluating patients' perceptions about ease of use, confidence in drug delivery, and overall device satisfaction at week 48 or end of study. Responses were summarized by counts and percentages. RESULTS:Of 620 patients who received glycopyrrolate/eFlow CS, 454 completed the questionnaire (mean age [standard deviation, SD] 63.3 [8.5] years; mean BMI [SD] 28.45 [6.208] kg/m2). Based on patient-reported perceptions, most patients (83%) were \"confident\" to \"very confident\" that the drug was delivered into their lungs with the eFlow CS; >70% rated the eFlow CS as \"easy\" or \"very easy\" to assemble, operate, and clean. Most (75%) patients ranked themselves as being \"satisfied\" or \"very satisfied\" overall with the eFlow CS nebulizer. CONCLUSIONS:High levels of satisfaction, confidence, and ease of use were reported with the eFlow CS nebulizer in this study. These findings support the use of the eFlow CS for maintenance treatment of COPD with glycopyrrolate inhalation solution."}
{"keyword": "Glycopyrrolate", "texts": "CONTEXT:Nerve agents like sarin or VX have repeatedly been used in military conflicts or homicidal attacks, as seen in Syria or Malaysia 2017. Together with pesticides, nerve agents assort as organophosphorus compounds (OP), which inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. To counteract subsequent fatal symptoms due to acetylcholine (ACh) accumulation, oximes plus atropine are administered, a regimen that lacks efficacy in several cases of OP poisoning. New therapeutics are in development, but still need evaluation before clinical employment. Supportive treatment with already approved drugs presents an alternative, whereby compounds from COPD and asthma therapy are likely options. A recent pilot study by Chowdhury et\u00a0al. included \u03b22-agonist salbutamol in the treatment of OP-pesticide poisoned patients, yielding ambiguous results concerning the addition. Here, we provide experimental data for further investigations regarding the value of these drugs in OP poisoning. METHODS:By video-microscopy, changes in airway area were analyzed in VX-poisoned rat precision cut lung slices (PCLS) after ACh-induced airway contraction and subsequent application of selected anticholinergics/\u03b22-agonists. RESULTS:Glycopyrrolate and ipratropium efficiently antagonized an ACh-induced airway contraction in VX-poisoned PCLS (EC50 glycopyrrolate 15.8\u2009nmol/L, EC50 ipratropium 2.3\u2009nmol/L). \u03b22-agonists formoterol and salbutamol had only negligible effects when solely applied in the same setting. However, combination of formoterol or salbutamol with low dosed glycopyrrolate or atropine led to an additive effect compared to the sole application [50.6\u2009\u00b1\u20098.8% airway area increase after 10\u2009nmol/L formoterol +1\u2009nmol/L atropine versus 11.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.2% (10\u2009nmol/L formoterol) or 8.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9% (1\u2009nmol/L atropine)]. DISCUSSION:We showed antagonizing effects of anticholinergics and \u03b22-agonists on ACh-induced airway contractions in VX-poisoned PCLS, thus providing experimental data to support a prospective comprehensive clinical study. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that COPD and asthma therapeutics could be a valuable addition to the treatment of OP poisoning."}
{"keyword": "Glycopyrrolate", "texts": "Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), along with long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABAs), are the mainstay for treatment of patients with COPD. Glycopyrrolate, or glycopyrronium bromide, like other LAMAs, inhibits parasympathetic nerve impulses by selectively blocking the binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors. Glycopyrrolate is unusual in that it preferentially binds to M3 over M2 muscarinic receptors, thereby specifically targeting the primary muscarinic receptor responsible for bronchoconstriction occurring in COPD. Inhaled glycopyrrolate is slowly absorbed from the lungs and rapidly eliminated from the bloodstream, most likely by renal excretion in its unmetabolized form, limiting the potential for systemic adverse events. Inhaled glycopyrrolate is a fast-acting, efficacious treatment option for patients with moderate-severe COPD. It improves lung function, reduces the risk of exacerbations, and alleviates the symptoms of breathlessness, which in turn may explain the improvement seen in patients' quality of life. Inhaled formulations containing glycopyrrolate are well tolerated, and despite being an anticholinergic, few cardiovascular-related events have been reported. Inhaled glycopyrrolate is thus of value as both monotherapy and in combination with other classes of medication for maintenance treatment of COPD. This review covers the mechanism of action of inhaled glycopyrrolate, including its pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety profiles, and effects on mucus secretion. It also discusses the use of inhaled glycopyrrolate in the treatment of COPD, as monotherapy and in fixed-dose combinations with LABAs and inhaled corticosteroid-LABAs, including a triple therapy recently approved in Europe."}

The time to intubation and hemodynamic variables at baseline and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after intubation were recorded.The OptiScope laryngeal view grades of the glycopyrrolate group (grade 1\u200a=\u200a16 [41.0%], 2\u200a=\u200a17 [43.6%], 3\u200a=\u200a6 [15.4%], and 4\u200a=\u200a0 [0%]) were significantly higher than those of the control group (grade 1\u200a=\u200a9 [23.1%], 2\u200a=\u200a11 [28.2%], 3\u200a=\u200a18 [46.2%], and 4\u200a=\u200a1 [2.6%]; P\u200a=\u200a.02). The intubation time was shorter in the glycopyrrolate group (18.5 seconds [15.0-22.0]) than the control group (22.0 seconds [17.9-26.4], P\u200a=\u200a.02).

Methods: A total of 2379 patients from 3 phase III studies (12-week, placebo-controlled Glycopyrrolate for Obstructive Lung Disease via Electronic Nebulizer [GOLDEN] -3 and -4, and 48-week, active-controlled GOLDEN-5) stratified by high (n=1526) or low (n=853) CV risk were randomized to placebo, GLY 25 mcg or 50 mcg twice daily, or tiotropium (TIO; 18 mcg once daily). Safety, lung function, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and exacerbations were assessed by CV risk. Results: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were similar across CV risk subgroups, with serious TEAEs higher in the high CV risk subgroup. In the 12-week studies, discontinuation due to TEAEs with GLY 25 mcg and 50 mcg was similar between CV risk subgroups, and lower than placebo (high risk: 6.2%, 3.6%, 9.0%; low risk: 3.2%, 4.5%, 9.9%, respectively). In the 48-week, open-label study, discontinuation rates were higher with GLY versus TIO (high risk: 10.7%, 3.7%; low risk: 8.7%, 1.2%, respectively). Rates of CV events of special interest were similar across CV risk subgroups. Regardless of CV risk, GLY led to significant improvements in efficacy and PRO assessments at 12 weeks versus placebo, whereas changes were similar between GLY and TIO at 48 weeks, except for PROs in the low risk subgroup. Exacerbation rates were similar across all treatment groups. Conclusions: Nebulized GLY had an acceptable safety profile and improved lung function and PROs in COPD patients, irrespective of CV risk status."}

Glycopyrrolate/eFlow\u00ae is an investigational drug-device combination of the LAMA glycopyrrolate administered by an eFlow\u00ae Closed System (eFlow\u00ae CS) nebulizer. The GOLDEN 2 (NCT01706536) and GOLDEN 6 (NCT02038829) Phase II, multicenter studies were conducted to inform dose selection for the GOLDEN Phase III clinical trials. Bronchodilator responses and safety assessments supported dose selection. METHODS:Subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized into 28-day parallel-group (GOLDEN 2) or 7-day crossover (GOLDEN 6) studies and received placebo, glycopyrrolate (3, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 or 100\u00a0\u03bcg twice daily [BID]) or aclidinium bromide 400\u00a0\u03bcg BID. The primary endpoint of both studies was change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV1). Safety assessments included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and discontinuation due to TEAE. Lung function data collected in both studies were pooled. RESULTS:The combined GOLDEN 2 (n\u2009=\u2009282) and GOLDEN 6 (n\u2009=\u200996) studies included 378 subjects. On Days 7 and 28 there were dose-ordered, statistically significant and clinically important lung function improvements in glycopyrrolate treatment groups. Specifically, on Day 7, glycopyrrolate produced >0.100\u00a0L placebo-adjusted changes from baseline in trough FEV1 (12.5\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.122\u00a0L; 25\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.123\u00a0L; 50\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.137\u00a0L) and FEV1 AUC0-12 (12.5\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.145\u00a0L; 25\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.178\u00a0L; 50\u00a0\u03bcg BID: 0.180\u00a0L). The improvements in lung function for the glycopyrrolate 25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg BID doses were comparable to those with aclidinium bromide 400\u00a0\u03bcg BID (FEV1: 0.149\u00a0L; FEV1 AUC0-12: 0.172\u00a0L). Acceptable safety profiles were observed across all groups in both studies. CONCLUSIONS:The efficacy and safety findings supported selection of glycopyrrolate 25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg BID doses for the Phase III GOLDEN studies and provided preliminary evidence for the use of nebulized glycopyrrolate as a maintenance therapy for COPD."}

{"keyword": "Glycopyrrolate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Glycopyrrolate administered by a novel, investigational eFlow\u00ae Closed System (CS) nebulizer (eFlow CS) is being evaluated for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The eFlow CS is a hand-held, vibrating membrane nebulizer optimized to deliver 1\u2009mL of glycopyrrolate solution into the lung in <3 minutes. Clinical studies have shown improvements in lung function of subjects treated with nebulized glycopyrrolate. METHODS:The aerosol performance of the eFlow CS nebulizer was characterized by delivered dose, aerodynamic droplet size distribution and nebulization time. Simulated use nebulizer performance over 60 days was assessed by volume median diameter (VMD), nebulized amount, and nebulization time. Nebulization outputs were assayed to ensure adequate delivery of glycopyrrolate with an acceptable impurity profile. Aerosol condensates were analyzed for glycopyrrolate concentration and impurities by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and compared with non-nebulized samples. RESULTS:The mean mass median aerodynamic diameter, geometric standard deviation, and fine particle fraction were 3.7\u2009\u03bcm, 1.7, and 72%, respectively, and independent of formulation strength (25 and 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL). Delivered dose was 88% of the nominal dose for both formulation strengths. The mean delivered dose, assessed by breathing simulation, was 56.8% for 25\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 62.6% for 50\u2009\u03bcg/mL. Nebulization times were 1-2.5 minutes with no apparent increasing trend with use over a 60-day period. The nebulized amount showed no significant changes, whereas the VMD showed a slight, but not pharmaceutically relevant, increase (0.1-0.2\u2009\u03bcm) after 60-day simulated use. Glycopyrrolate concentration and impurity levels of nebulized samples were statistically similar to those of non-nebulized samples. CONCLUSION:The eFlow CS generates glycopyrrolate aerosols with high delivered dose, short treatment time, and small droplet size with narrow size distribution suitable for central and peripheral airway deposition. The unit dose vial mitigates medication misuse and ensures dose uniformity. Results support the use of glycopyrrolate/eFlow CS for the treatment of COPD."}

We present as case report of a 17-year-old male with the highest sweat rate recorded in the literature (5.8 L/h). Our goal was to determine if glycopyrrolate, an anticholinergic medication with primarily anti-muscarinic effects that is known to decrease sweat production, would reduce the sweat rate of our subject in a controlled exercise setting. METHODS:Our patient and a control subject were subjected to an exercise protocol consisting of running on a treadmill (5.4-6.7 mile/h at 1\u00b0 of incline) in a warm climate-controlled chamber after receiving 0, 2, or 4 mg of glycopyrrolate. Core temperature, heart rate, rater of perceived exertion, and sweat rate were monitored in both subjects. RESULTS:Glycopyrrolate dose was not significantly correlated with decreased sweat rate and maximal core temperature. However, the clinical effect of reducing the sweat rate was very strong. The improvement of the subject's sweat rate allowed him to successfully return to sport. CONCLUSION:Our findings suggest that low-dose glycopyrrolate may be a safe and effective method of controlling exertional hyperhidrosis."}

MATERIAL AND METHODS\u00a0:A cross-sectional, pharmacoepidemiological study was conducted among patients undergoing surgical procedures in routine or emergency conditions under general anesthesia. The utilization of pre-anesthetic medicines in all patients was reported. RESULTS:A total of 110 patients (mean age - 42.36 years; 57.27% males) were enrolled. The major (>10%) indications for surgery were carcinoma/tumor - 25 (22.73%), perforation peritonitis - 20 (18.18%), and intestinal obstruction - 11 (10%). All patients received ranitidine plus metoclopramide. Injections of ondansetron, midazolam, pentazocin, anticholinergic agents, and fentanyl were used in 103 (93.64%), 103 (93.64%), 92 (83.64%), 84 (76.36%), and 23 (20.91%) patients, respectively. The dosage of ondansetron was 4 mg in 95 patients (86.36%), while 89.09% patients received 1 mg of midazolam. In 86\u00a0patients (78.18%), pentazocine was used in a 15 mg dose.

Because of these shortages, commonly used medications are at the greatest risk. Glycopyrrolate (Robinul), which has been in short supply in recent years, is one of the most widely used anticholinergic agents, especially in conjunction with the anticholinesterase neostigmine, for reversal of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) drugs. Here we review multiple studies from 1972 through 1986 that used varying methods of patient selection and dosage and drug combination criteria, and which noted that glycopyrrolate had a superior efficacy and adverse effect profile when compared with atropine in NMB reversal. Meta-analysis from these studies indicated that the dosage of 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate for every 1 mg of neostigmine, given concomitantly (maximum 1 mg glycopyrrolate and 5 mg neostigmine), demonstrated the greatest efficacy with the lowest incidence of unwanted adverse effects. It has now become common practice to use a dosage ratio of 0.2 mg glycopyrrolate to 1.0 mg neostigmine for NMB reversal. Yet since 1986, there have been no studies on reversal with glycopyrrolate and neostigmine. Frequent medication shortages and good medical practice should be an impetus for clinicians to reevaluate dosing practices of critical medications and revisit these drugs, such as glycopyrrolate, with more current studies."}

Therefore, we investigated whether intraoperative reverse Trendelenburg positioning (RTP) decreases POH and POPA rates.Consecutive ASA I-IV surgical patients who had preoperative pulmonary stability requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation were evaluated. Using pulse oximetry, hypoxemia was documented intraoperatively and during the 48\u00a0h following PACU discharge. POPA was the presence of a pulmonary infiltrate with hypoxemia. In early 2015, a multifaceted effort was undertaken to enhance anesthesiologist and operating nurse awareness of RTP to potentially decrease POH and POPA rates. Analyses included (1) combining 2012 and 2015 cohorts to assess risk conditions, (2) comparing post-campaign 2015 (increased RTP) and 2012 cohorts, and (3) comparing 2015 patients with audit-documented RTP during surgery to the other 2015 patients.Combining the 500 patients in 2012 with the 1000 in 2015 showed that POH had increased mortality (2.3%), compared to no POH (0.2%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004).

The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of glycopyrrolate versus placebo in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second area under the curve between 0 and 12 hours post morning dose at week 12. Other outcomes included additional spirometric end points, transition dyspnea index, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire, COPD Assessment Test, rescue medication use, and symptoms reported by patients via electronic diary. Safety was also assessed during the study.Of the 441 patients randomized (glycopyrrolate, n=222; placebo, n=219), 96% of patients completed the planned treatment phase. Glycopyrrolate demonstrated statistically significant (P<0.001) improvements in lung function versus placebo. Glycopyrrolate showed statistically significant improvement in the transition dyspnea index focal score, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score, COPD Assessment Test score, rescue medication use, and daily total symptom score versus placebo at week 12. Safety was comparable between the treatment groups.Significant improvement in lung function, dyspnea, COPD symptoms, health status, and rescue medication use suggests that glycopyrrolate is a safe and effective treatment option as maintenance bronchodilator in patients with stable, symptomatic COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation."}
{"keyword": "Glycopyrrolate", "texts": "OBJECTIVE To determine effects of glycopyrrolate administered IM on Schirmer tear test I (STT I) measurements in dogs. DESIGN Prospective clinical study. ANIMALS 13 client- and staff-owned dogs. PROCEDURES For both eyes of each dog, STT I measurements were recorded twice 20 minutes apart (at T1 and T2) and 2 to 4 hours later (at T3). Glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg [0.005 mg/lb]) was administered IM to all dogs (3 dogs received an injection of saline [0.9% NaCl] solution on an earlier occasion), and final STT I measurements were recorded 20 minutes later (at T4). Intraocular pressures, heart rate, and respiratory rate were also recorded at each time point. RESULTS Ophthalmic variables did not differ between right and left eyes. In all dogs, variables at T1, T2, or T3 (measurements before glycopyrrolate administration) did not differ; baseline values were therefore defined at T3. At T4, STT I measurements were significantly decreased (mean \u00b1 SD decrease, 67.4 \u00b1 15.4% [mean actual decrease, 15.8 mm/min]). During the same period, mean heart rate increased by 26.5 \u00b1 12.0% (mean actual increase, 30.2 beats/min). Glycopyrrolate had no effect on intraocular pressure or respiratory rate. In 5 dogs at 24 hours after glycopyrrolate treatment, STT I measurement in each eye had returned to baseline value. Saline solution treatment (3 dogs) had no effect on any variables. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE In dogs, IM injection of glycopyrrolate resulted in a clinically relevant transient decrease in aqueous tear production. Application of lacrimomimetics beginning at the time of or within 20 minutes after glycopyrrolate premedication is recommended until STT I measurements return to baseline."}

This 12-week multicenter, double-blind study randomized (1:1) patients to glycopyrrolate 15.6 \u03bcg twice daily (b.i.d.) or placebo both delivered via the NeohalerTM device. The primary objective was superiority of glycopyrrolate compared with placebo for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) standardized area under curve (AUC) between 0 and 12 hours post dosing (FEV1 AUC0-12h)at week 12. Other outcomes included additional spirometry parameters, health status using St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), dyspnea via Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), rescue medication use and COPD symptoms reported by patients via the electronic diary. Safety was also assessed. Of the 432 patients randomized (glycopyrrolate, n=216; placebo, n=216), 96% completed the planned treatment phase.

The transdermal patch allows for a continuous, stable release of rotigotine (avoiding first-pass metabolism), which in turn leads to continuous receptor stimulation, believed to closely mimic physiological striatal dopamine receptor function. In short-term and 6-month studies, especially at the higher dosages of 2 and 3\u00a0mg/24\u00a0h, rotigotine transdermal patch was generally associated with a significantly greater improvement in IRLS total score and CGI-S total score than placebo, and rotigotine recipients were generally more likely to respond to treatment and enter remission. In noncomparative extension studies, efficacy was sustained for \u22645\u00a0years. Rotigotine transdermal patch is generally well tolerated, and appears to have a tolerability profile that is similar to that of other non-ergolinic dopamine-receptor agonists. The most common adverse events in clinical trials included application-site reactions, nausea, headache and asthenic conditions. The drug has a relatively low risk of clinically significant augmentation of restless legs syndrome symptoms. In conclusion, rotigotine transdermal patch offers continuous administration of the drug in a daily treatment, and is a useful treatment option in patients with RLS."}

Due to an extensive first-pass effect, it has a very low oral bioavailability (approximately 0.5% in rats).The present investigation aimed to develop a microemulsion-based hydrogel for transdermal rotigotine delivery with lower application site reactions.Pseudoternary phase diagrams were constructed to determine the region of oil in water (o/w)-type microemulsion. Central composite design was used to support the pseudoternary phase diagrams and to select homogeneous and stable microemulsions with an optimal amount of rotigotine permeation within 24 hours. In vitro skin permeation experiments were performed, using Franz diffusion cells, to compare rotigotine-loaded microemulsions with rotigotine solutions in oil. The optimized formulation was used to prepare a microemulsion-based hydrogel, which was subjected to bioavailability and skin irritancy studies.The selected formulations of rotigotine-loaded microemulsions had enhanced flux and permeation coefficients compared with rotigotine in oil. The optimum microemulsion contained 68% water, 6.8% Labrafil(\u00ae), 13.44% Cremophor(\u00ae) RH40, 6.72% Labrasol(\u00ae), and 5.04% Transcutol(\u00ae) HP; the drug-loading rate was 2%.

The prevalence is estimated at 3% to 15% of the population and may present as primary RLS or secondary RLS. Secondary RLS may be a result of some medications, iron deficiency, or conditions such as neuropathies, or it may be related to pregnancy. The guidelines for diagnosis, which is usually made on clinical presentation, are discussed in the article. Medication use is not always necessary in the management of RLS. Multiple options are available and are reviewed within the article. Since 2011, two medications have been approved for the treatment of RLS, and these are discussed in detail. Neupro (rotigotine) is a dopamine agonist available as a patch that has been approved for the treatment of RLS as well as Parkinson disease. One of the major issues in treating RLS with dopamine agonists is augmentation, meaning symptoms occur earlier in the day due to medication use. This rate of augmentation with use of rotigotine is significantly lower than other dopamine agonists. Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) is the only nondopaminergic medication approved for the treatment of RLS. Bioavailability is greater in gabapentin enacarbil as compared to gabapentin. Augmentation has not been associated with gabapentin or gabapentin enacarbil. Neupro (rotigotine) and Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) provide additional treatment options for patients with RLS who are in need of medications. Consideration of each individual patient is necessary when determining if medication is needed and in choosing the appropriate agent."}

Patients had PD with documented need for care, and had received rotigotine transdermal patch as add-on to oral PD treatment for \u22651 month. Caregivers/nurses and physicians assessed rotigotine transdermal patch versus oral PD medications using questionnaires. Specific questions regarding the possible benefits of transdermal application were asked and comprised questions on: swallowing dysfunction, nausea/vomiting, monitoring therapy, once daily application, application independently from meals, application to sleeping patients, caregiving efforts (caregivers only) and clinical aspects (physicians only). Each question was assessed on a 5 point scale ranging from -2 (major disadvantage) to 2 (major advantage) compared with oral treatment. Primary outcomes were mean total scores of all questions for caregivers/nurses and physicians who provided responses for \u22654 questions. As there are no validated tools to assess physician/caregiver preference in the PD setting, there is no reference against which the current findings can be compared; this study serves to pilot the questionnaires.Questionnaire responses from 128 caregivers/nurses and 41 physicians were documented for 147 patients.

Daily application of the rotigotine patch provided predictable release and absorption of rotigotine, with steady-state rotigotine concentrations reached within 1-2 days. In early Parkinson's disease, compared with placebo, rotigotine monotherapy produced significantly greater improvements in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale summed motor and activities of daily living (ADL) scores (primary endpoint), as well as significantly higher response rates. In advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reduced 'off' time (primary endpoint) and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. In patients with inadequate early morning motor control despite antiparkinsonian treatment, rotigotine improved morning motor functioning and reduced sleep disturbances, night-time motor symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain and functioning, and quality of life to a significantly greater extent than placebo. The efficacy of rotigotine relative to other treatments requires further evaluation, as there were inconsistent results in noninferiority analyses that compared rotigotine to other dopamine agonists. Rotigotine was generally well tolerated across the trials, with the most common treatment-emergent adverse events being application-site reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances, somnolence and headache.

In six large, well designed clinical trials, rotigotine was an efficacious treatment for Parkinson's disease. In early Parkinson's disease, rotigotine initiated without levodopa produced significantly greater improvements than placebo in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) summed motor and activities of daily living (ADL) scores, as well as significantly higher response rates.

In advanced Parkinson's disease, rotigotine in combination with levodopa reduced 'off' time and improved motor functioning and ADL significantly more than levodopa plus placebo. Rotigotine was noninferior to oral pramipexole in reducing 'off' time, although it did not meet a response-rate noninferiority criterion. A recent trial focused on both motor and non-motor endpoints in patients with inadequate early morning motor control despite antiparkinsonian treatment (most received levodopa). Rotigotine improved morning motor functioning and reduced sleep disturbances, night-time motor symptoms, depressive symptoms, pain and functioning, and quality of life to a significantly greater extent than placebo.

{"keyword": "Neupro", "texts": "The nonergoline dopamine agonist rotigotine, is delivered transdermally using a silicone-based patch (Neupro(R); UCB Pharma GmbH), which promotes unidirectional drug flow from the transdermal system to the skin. Pharmacokinetic data show stable steady-state plasma concentrations over 24 h, maintained with once-daily patch administration. Stable plasma concentrations are reflected by stable concentrations in the brain, as has been shown in animal studies. This suggests a continuous stimulation of dopaminergic receptors, which may result in a reduction in or prevention of abnormal involuntary movements in Parkinson's disease (PD) after prolonged treatment. Clinical trials have demonstrated that rotigotine is efficacious as monotherapy for PD and restless legs syndrome (RLS), and open-label extension studies have shown its long-term efficacy. Furthermore, rotigotine can be used effectively in coadministration with levodopa, enabling a reduction of the levodopa treatment doses in PD. Transdermal application also yields favorable pharmacokinetics for rotigotine: rapid metabolism and lack of skin accumulation allow for good control of chronic administration or withdrawal by patch removal, and the transdermal application approach circumvents problems of gastrointestinal absorption and enables administration prior to, during or following surgery. In addition, no dose adaptation is required regarding gender or ethnicity, or for patients with impaired liver or kidney function or on hemodialysis. The safety profile of rotigotine transdermal patch is favorable; common side effects attributed to transdermal delivery or dopaminergic stimulation are generally mild to moderate in intensity. Importantly, augmentation of RLS is uncommon under long-term rotigotine treatment and dyskinesia in PD patients mostly developed only after levodopa initiation. Overall, rotigotine transdermal patch has demonstrated favorable clinical efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of PD and RLS."}

To fully understand the pharmacological actions of rotigotine, the present study determined its extended receptor profile. In standard binding assays, rotigotine demonstrated the highest affinity for dopamine receptors, particularly the dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=0.71 nM) with its affinities to other dopamine receptors being (Ki in nM): D4.2 (3.9), D4.7 (5.9), D5 (5.4), D2 (13.5), D4.4 (15), and D1 (83). Significant affinities were also demonstrated at alpha-adrenergic (alpha2B, Ki=27 nM) and serotonin receptors (5-HT1A Ki=30 nM). In newly developed reporter-gene assays for determination of functional activity, rotigotine behaved as a full agonist at dopamine receptors (rank order: D3>D2L>D1=D5>D4.4) with potencies 2,600 and 53 times higher than dopamine at dopamine D3 and D2L receptors, respectively. At alpha-adrenergic sites, rotigotine acted as an antagonist on alpha2B receptors. At serotonergic sites, rotigotine had a weak but significant agonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptors and a minor or nonexistent activity at other serotonin receptors. Thus, in respect to PD, rotigotine can be characterized as a specific dopamine receptor agonist with a preference for the D3 receptor over D2 and D1 receptors. In addition, it exhibits interaction with D4 and D5 receptors, the role of which in relation to PD is not clear yet. Among non-dopaminergic sites, rotigotine shows relevant affinity to only 5-HT1A and alpha2B receptors. Further studies are necessary to investigate the contribution of the different receptor subtypes to the efficacy of rotigotine in Parkinson's disease and possible other indications such as restless legs syndrome."}

For comparison, the mixed dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor nomifensine (16 mg/kg p.o.) was administered once daily for 6 days. In contrast to nomifensine, rotigotine (0.5 and 5 mg/kg s.c.) had no clear effects on the sleep-wake cycle. Nomifensine delayed the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and, to a lesser extent, also that of slow wave sleep (SWS). In addition, it increased the duration of waking time and decreased the duration of SWS and REM sleep. These effects were observed on all days and repeated administration lead neither to potentiation nor attenuation of the effects. It is concluded that a continuous dopaminergic stimulation of dopamine receptors by rotigotine may not only be beneficial for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease but also have additional benefits by not compromising either sleep architecture or circadian rhythm."}

The primary focus of this subanalysis was the separate tolerability of rotigotine in each randomized treatment arm, during the dose-escalation period. However, the 2 titration schemes were also compared with each other.The dose of first reported nausea and/or vomiting was 8 mg/24 h for the fast-titration group and 4 mg/ 24 h for the slow-titration group. There were no remarkable differences concerning the side-effect profile between the 2 different titration schemes.The fast-titration regimen had a similar adverse event profile to slower titration, and allowed rotigotine to be introduced quickly.

Testosterone is beneficial in learning and memory, although the underlying protective mechanism of testosterone on cognitive performance remains unclear. This study explored the protective mechanism of a subcutaneous injection of 0.75 mg testosterone on cognitive dysfunction induced by bilateral injections of amyloid beta 1-42 oligomers into the lateral ventricles of male rats. Morris water maze test results demonstrated that testosterone treatment remarkably reduced escape latency and path length in Alzheimer's disease rat models. During probe trials, testosterone administration significantly elevated the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant and the number of platform crossings. However, flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, inhibited the protective effect of testosterone on cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease rat models. Nissl staining, immunohistochemistry, western blot assay, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results showed that the number of intact hippocampal pyramidal cells, the dendritic spine density in the hippocampal CA1 region, the immune response and expression level of postsynaptic density protein 95 in the hippocampus, and the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase were increased with testosterone treatment. In contrast, testosterone treatment reduced malondialdehyde levels. Flutamide inhibited the effects of testosterone on all of these indicators. Our data showed that the protective effect of testosterone on cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease is mediated via androgen receptors to scavenge free radicals, thereby enhancing synaptic plasticity."}

Maintaining and enhancing testosterone level in men is an incessant target for many researchers. Examples of such research approaches is to utilize specific types of food or dietary supplements as a safe and easily reached means. Here, specifically, since 1967 until now, many research studies have revealed the effect of onion on testosterone; however, this link has yet to be collectively reviewed or summarized. To accomplish this contribution, we searched the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for full articles or abstracts (published in English language) from April 1967 through December 2018 using the keywords \"onion\" versus \"testosterone\". In addition, a number of related published articles from the same databases were included to improve the integrity of the discussion, and hence the edge of the future directions. In summary, there is an evidence that onions enhance testosterone level in males. The mechanisms by which this occurs is mainly by increasing the production of luteinizing hormone, enhancing the antioxidant defense mechanism in the tests, neutralizing the damaging effects of the generated free radicals, ameliorating insulin resistance, promoting nitric oxide production, and altering the activity of adenosine 5'-monophosphate -activated protein kinase. However, this effect requires further approval in humans, mainly by conducting clinical trials."}

Lesions of the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) inhibit while stereotaxic testosterone implants into this nucleus increase singing rate suggesting that this site plays a key role in the regulation of singing motivation. Testosterone action in the song control system works in parallel to control song quality. Accordingly, systemic testosterone increases POM volume within 1-2\u202fdays in female canaries, while the increase in volume of song control nuclei takes at least 2\u202fweeks. The current study tested whether testosterone action is associated with similar differences in latencies in males. Photosensitive castrated male canaries were implanted with testosterone-filled Silastic\u2122 implants and control castrates received empty implants, while simultaneously the photoperiod was switched from short- to long-days. Brains were collected from all subjects two days later. Plasma testosterone was elevated in testosterone-treated but not in controls. HVC volumes were not affected, but testosterone significantly increased the POM volume as identified by the dense group of aromatase-immunoreactive neurons, the number and somal area of these neurons and the fractional area they cover in POM. Testosterone-treated females from a previous experiment had a smaller POM volume in similar conditions suggesting the existence of a stable sex difference potentially affecting singing behavior. Thus testosterone induces male POM growth and aromatase expression in this nucleus within two days without affecting HVC size, further supporting the notion that testosterone increases singing motivation via its action in POM."}

Adult male Wistar rats were trained using a motor-driven treadmill for 6 weeks (40-60 min, 5 times per week) and/or were treated for 6 weeks with two doses of testosterone (i.m.; 8 mg/kg or 80 mg/kg body weight). Spinal cords were collected 48 hours after the last training cycle and stored at -80\u00b0C. The levels of selected proteins in whole tissue lysates of the spinal cord were measured by western blot. Testosterone-treated trained rats had significantly lower claudin levels than vehicle-treated trained rats. High doses of testosterone resulted in a significant decrease in claudin-5 in untrained rats compared to the control group. Both doses of testosterone significantly reduced occludin levels compared to those in vehicle-treated untrained rats. The JAM-1 level in the spinal cords of both trained and untrained animals receiving testosterone was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. The JAM-1 level in the trained group treated with high doses of testosterone was significantly higher than that in the untrained rats treated with 80 mg/kg of testosterone. VE-cadherin levels were decreased in all groups receiving testosterone regardless of endurance training and were also diminished in the vehicle-treated group compared to the control group. Testosterone treatment did not exert a significant effect on ZO-1 protein levels. Testosterone and/or training had no significant effects on ZO-2 protein levels in the rat spinal cords. Endurance training increased P-glycoprotein levels in the rat spinal cords. The results suggest that an excessive supply of testosterone may adversely impact the expression of endothelial proteins in the central nervous system, which, in turn, may affect the blood-brain barrier function."}

Men with HH are at increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality, as well as of the development of incident T2DM. AIM:To review the current literature on the metabolic effects of testosterone therapy (TTh) in men with T2DM and MetS. METHODS:We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Reviews for articles on T2DM, HH, testosterone deficiency, and CV and all-cause mortality published between May 2005 and July 2018, yielding 1817 articles, including 54 clinical trials and 32 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:The main outcomes were glycemic control, insulin resistance, lipid profile, and metabolic markers associated with increased CV risk. RESULTS:RCTs of TTh suggest significant benefits for sexual function, quality of life, glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, anemia, bone density, and fat and lean muscle mass that might be expected to translate into reduced long-term morbidity and mortality. Several longitudinal and observational studies suggest long-term sustained improvements in metabolic parameters and a trend toward reduced CV and all-cause mortality, especially in men at increased CV risk, such as those with T2DM and MetS. The greatest benefit is seen in those men treated with TTh to target levels and for longer durations. CONCLUSION:Meta-analyses of RCTs, rather than providing clarification, may have further confused the issue by including underpowered studies of inadequate duration, multiple therapy regimens, some obsolete or withdrawn, and built-in bias in terms of studies included or excluded from analysis.

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "Little is known about the neurobiological pathways through which testosterone promotes aggression or about the people in whom this effect is observed. Using a psychopharmacogenetic approach, we found that testosterone increases aggression in men ( N = 308) with select personality profiles and that these effects are further enhanced among those with fewer cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, a polymorphism associated with increased AR efficiency. Testosterone's effects were rapid (~30 min after administration) and mediated, in part, by subjective reward associated with aggression. Testosterone thus appears to promote human aggression through an AR-related mechanism and to have stronger effects in men with the select personality profiles because it more strongly upregulates the subjective pleasure they derive from aggression. Given other evidence that testosterone regulates reward through dopaminergic pathways, and that the sensitivity of such pathways is enhanced among individuals with the personality profiles we identified, our findings may also implicate dopaminergic processes in testosterone's heterogeneous effects on aggression."}

The death of renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) is an important pathophysiological process contributing to the development of nephrolithiasis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate whether androgen directly induces TECs apoptosis and necrosis and its underlying mechanisms in kidney stone formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We compared serum testosterone level between male and female healthy volunteers and kidney stone patients. The in vivo nephrolithiasis model was established using glyoxylic acid, and calcium deposits were detected by van Kossa staining. In the in vitro study using mouse TECs (TCMK-1 cells) and human TECs (HK-2 cells), apoptosis, necrosis, and the expression of BH3-only protein Bcl-2-like 19\u00a0kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) were examined incubated with different doses of testosterone using flow cytometry. Levels of apoptosis-related proteins transfected with the BNIP3 siRNA were examined by western blotting. The mitochondrial potential (\u0394\u03a8m) was detected by JC-1 staining and flow cytometry. We monitored BNIP3 expression in the testosterone-induced TECs injury model after treatment with hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and/or hypoxia inducible factor 2\u03b1 (HIF-2\u03b1) inhibitors to determine the upstream protein regulating BNIP3 expression. Additionally, ChIP and luciferase assays were performed to confirm the interaction between HIF-1\u03b1 and BNIP3. RESULTS:Both male and female patients have significantly higher testosterones compared with healthy volunteers. More calcium deposits in the medulla were detected in male mice compared to female and castrated male mice. Testosterone induced TECs apoptosis and necrosis and increased BNIP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Testosterone also increased Bax expression, decreased Bcl-2 expression and induced a loss of \u0394\u03a8m. This effect was reversed by BNIP3 knockdown. HIF-1\u03b1 inhibition significantly decreased BNIP3 expression and protected TECs from testosterone-induced apoptosis and necrosis. HIF-2\u03b1 inhibition, however, did not influence BNIP3 expression or TECs apoptosis or necrosis. Finally, HIF-1\u03b1 interacted with the BNIP3 promoter region. CONCLUSION:Based on these results, testosterone induced renal TECs death by activating the HIF-1\u03b1/BNIP3 pathway."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are frequent in aging. Nonetheless, their pathogenesis is largely unknown. The androgen dependence of the first phases of prostate development have inspired the historical view that higher testosterone (T) may be involved in BPH occurrence; however, recent evidence suggests a different scenario. AIM:To review the available knowledge on the pathogenesis of BPH particularly concerning the role of T and the possible connections with metabolic impairments. METHODS:Relevant records were retrieved by an extensive search in Medline, including the following keywords (\"testosterone\"[MeSH Terms] OR \"testosterone\"[All Fields]) AND (\"prostatic hyperplasia\"[MeSH Terms] OR (\"prostatic\"[All Fields] AND \"hyperplasia\"[All Fields]) OR \"prostatic hyperplasia\"[All Fields] OR (\"benign\"[All Fields] AND \"prostatic\"[All Fields] AND \"hyperplasia\"[All Fields]) OR \"benign prostatic hyperplasia\"[All Fields]). There were no limitations in terms of publication date or study design. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Preclinical and clinical studies have been reported, with special emphasis on our contribution and interpretation. RESULTS:Inflammation is a key aspect of BPH development. Along with infectious agents, prostate inflammation can be triggered by metabolic stimuli, such as dyslipidemia, an important component of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Low T and hyperestrogenism frequently occur in MetS. Mounting evidence shows that low, rather than high, T and hyperestrogenism may favor prostate inflammation. Considering these data as a whole, we postulate that BPH is the result of the action of multiple factors, which reinforce their mutual detrimental effects. CONCLUSION:T is not detrimental for the prostate, and treating hypogonadism could even produce relief from LUTS and limit prostatic inflammation, which generates and maintains the process leading to BPH.

We retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 435 serum samples retrieved from castrated prostate cancer patients. Serum testosterone levels were measured in the same sample using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry and electrochemiluminescent immunoassay methods (April to September 2017). The mean testosterone levels were significantly higher with immunoassay than with mass spectrometry (0.672\u00b10.359 vs. 0.461\u00b10.541 nM; p<0.0001). Half of the samples with testosterone \u22650.7 nM assessed by immunoassay were measured <0.7 nM using mass spectrometry. However, we observed that only 2.95% of the samples with testosterone <0.7 nM measured by immunoassay were quantified \u22650.7 nM using mass spectrometry. The percentage of serum samples experiencing testosterone breakthrough at <0.7 nM was significantly higher with immunoassay (22.1%) than with mass spectrometry (13.1%; p<0.0001). Quantitative measurement of serum testosterone levels <0.7 nM by immunoassay can result in an inaccurately identified castration status. Suboptimal testosterone levels in castrated patients should be confirmed either by mass spectrometry or an immunoassay method validated at low testosterone levels and interpreted with caution before any changes are made to treatment management."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Several data have clearly shown that the endocrine system-and androgens in particular-play a pivotal role in regulating all the steps involved in the male sexual response cycle. Accordingly, testosterone (T) replacement therapy (TRT) represents a cornerstone of pharmacologic management of hypogonadal subjects with erectile dysfunction. AIM:The aim of this review is to summarize all the available evidence supporting the role of T in the regulation of male sexual function and to provide a comprehensive summary regarding the sexual outcomes of TRT in patients complaining of sexual dysfunction. METHODS:A comprehensive PubMed literature search was performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:Specific analysis of preclinical and clinical evidence on the role of T in regulating male sexual function was performed. In addition, available evidence supporting the role of TRT on several sexual outcomes was separately investigated. RESULTS:T represents an important modulator of male sexual response function. However, the role of T in sexual functioning is less evident in epidemiologic studies because other factors, including organic, relational, and intrapsychic determinants, can orchestrate their effect independently from the state of androgens. Nonetheless, it is clear that TRT can ameliorate several aspects of sexual functioning, including libido, erectile function, and overall sexual satisfaction. Conversely, data on the role of TRT in improving orgasmic function are more conflicting. Finally, further controlled studies are needed to investigate the combination of TRT and PDE5 inhibitors. CONCLUSION:Positive effects of TRT are observed only in the presence of a hypogonadal status (ie, total T < 12 nmol/L). In addition, TRT alone can be effective in restoring only milder forms of erectile dysfunction, whereas the combined therapy with other drugs is required when more severe vascular damage is present.

Currently, antidepressants are the first-line treatment, although they show modest effects. In men, testosterone treatment is a controversial alternative or adjunct treatment option. Objectives:To examine the association of testosterone treatment with alleviation of depressive symptoms in men and to clarify moderating effects of testosterone status, depression status, age, treatment duration, and dosage. Data Sources:English-language studies published in peer-reviewed journals identified from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Scopus, PsychINFO, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register from database inception to March 5, 2018, using the search terms testosterone, mood, administration, dosage, adverse effects, deficiency, standards, therapeutic use, therapy, treatment, and supplementation. Study Selection:Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of testosterone treatment that together cover a broad age range and hypogonadal or eugonadal men reporting depressive symptoms on psychometrically validated depression scales. Data Extraction and Synthesis:Of 7690 identified records, 469 were evaluated against full study inclusion criteria after removing duplicates, reviews, and studies that did not examine male patients or testosterone. Quality assessment and data extraction from the remaining 27 RCTs were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures:Primary outcomes were testosterone treatment effectiveness (standardized score difference after treatment), efficacy (proportion of patients who responded to testosterone treatment with a score reduction of 50% or greater), and acceptability (proportion of patients who withdrew for any reason). Results:Random-effects meta-analysis of 27 RCTs including 1890 men suggested that testosterone treatment is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms compared with placebo (Hedges g,\u20090.21; 95% CI, 0.10-0.32), showing an efficacy of odds ratio (OR), 2.30 (95% CI, 1.30-4.06). There was no significant difference between acceptability of testosterone treatment and placebo (OR,\u20090.79; 95% CI, 0.61-1.01). Meta-regression models suggested significant interactions for testosterone treatment with dosage and symptom variability at baseline.

Conclusions and Relevance:Testosterone treatment appears to be effective and efficacious in reducing depressive symptoms in men, particularly when higher-dosage regimens were applied in carefully selected samples. However, given the heterogeneity of the included RCTs, more preregistered trials are needed that explicitly examine depression as the primary end point and consider relevant moderators."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Testosterone therapy for women is in widespread use, primarily in the form of compounded preparations and off-label use of formulations for men. The benefits and risks of such therapy remain uncertain. This review will identify and evaluate studies that have examined the effects of testosterone therapy for women on a range of outcomes including sexual function, cardiovascular events, metabolic parameters, musculoskeletal health, wellbeing, cancer events, androgenic effects and withdrawal rates. METHODS:Studies meeting our pre-determined inclusion criteria will be identified through searches in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and Web of Science. Assessing a range of outcomes, we will assess the risk-of-bias of relevant studies and draw conclusions about the strength of evidence for benefits and risks of testosterone therapy for each outcome. DISCUSSION:This comprehensive systematic review with meta-analysis will provide the foundation for the development of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines that will address benefits and risks of testosterone therapy, when treatment might be appropriate or inappropriate, areas of clinical uncertainty and the basis for assessment and monitoring of patients.

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Testosterone-boosting supplements (T-Boosters) are prominently featured on Amazon.com, with numerous dedicated pages and claims that they \"naturally\" increase testosterone levels. AIM:To evaluate the highest rated and frequently reviewed T-Boosters on Amazon.com to facilitate patient counseling regarding marketing myths, T-Booster formulations, and evidence for efficacy and safety. METHODS:The Amazon marketplace was queried using the key words \"testosterone\"\u00a0+ \"booster,\" with default search settings and ranking items based on relevance. The top 5 T-Boosters identified on July 22, 2018, were reviewed based on price, ratings, reviews, manufacturer details, and ingredients. Consumer reviews were categorized using core themes in the Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) questionnaire as a proxy to understand T-Booster efficacy and reanalyzed after filtration of untrustworthy comments using ReviewMeta.com, a proprietary Amazon customer review analysis software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of T-Boosters on Amazon.com was performed. RESULTS:The top 5 T-Boosters had an average \u00b1 SD of 2,761 \u00b1 5,112 reviews and a rating of 4.56 \u00b1 0.25 stars. 19 unique ingredients were identified across these T-Boosters, and literature review revealed 191 studies involving the 10 most common ingredients, of which 19% involved human subjects, 53% animal models, 15% in\u00a0vitro studies, and 12% case reports or review articles. Among 37 human studies, 30% observed an increase in T levels, 3% a decrease, 46% no effect, and 22% were indeterminate. Analysis of top customer reviews from the first 2 pages of reviews for each supplement revealed differences in the ADAM score before and after ReviewMeta.com filtration. After filtration, there was a 91% decrease in users reporting increased libido, a 59% decrease in reports of increased energy, a 93% decrease in reports of improved strength/endurance, a 60% decrease in reports of improved erections, an elimination of reports of improved work performance, a 67% decrease in reports of improved sleep, and an 89% decrease in reports of improved sports ability. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:Our study can serve as a guide for providers to counsel patients about the efficacy of popular online T-Boosters as well as the prevalence of disingenuous reviews associated with these products on online marketplaces like Amazon.com. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS:Strengths include the novel approach to assess consumers' perceptions and satisfaction of T-Boosters, as well as summary information that clinicians can provide patients. Limitations include selection bias, a small number of supplements analyzed, and the proprietary nature of the Amazon review analysis software. CONCLUSION:T-Boosters are easily available online. Our investigation revealed that limited human studies have evaluated T-Boosters, resulting in no definitive findings of efficacy. In the absence of additional human studies, patients should be cautioned before considering T-Boosters, given the availability of highly effective therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

We aimed to investigate the role of testosterone in the development of aging-related cardiac remodeling and the mechanisms involved. METHODS:Wild type and Axl knockout mice (Axl-/-) were randomized into three groups: the young group (n\u202f=\u202f30, 3\u202fmonths old), the aging group (n\u202f=\u202f30, 18\u202fmonths old), the testosterone undecanoate treatment group (TU, n\u202f=\u202f30, 18\u202fmonths old). Mice in the TU group were given testosterone undecanoate (39\u202fmg/kg) by subcutaneous injection on the back at fifteen-months-old, once a month, a total of three times. The old group received solvent reagent (corn oil) by the same method. RESULTS:The aging mice exhibited a decrease in serum testosterone, and Gas6 levels and an increase in apoptosis, and manifested cardiac fibrosis. Testosterone injection to wild type mice increased the levels of testosterone and Gas6 in serum and decreased cardiac apoptosis and fibrosis. Axl-/-mice receiving testosterone injection exhibited no obvious improvement in cardiac remodeling although the levels of testosterone and Gas6 in serum elevated. CONCLUSIONS:These data indicated that testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) alleviates cardiac fibrosis and apoptosis, at least in part by enhancing Gas6 expression. Moreover, deletion of Axl disables testosterone, which indicated that Axl is an important downstream regulator of testosterone. TRT would improve aging-related cardiac remolding via Gas6/Axl signaling pathway, implicating its therapeutic potential to treat aging-related heart disease."}

Testosterone replacement therapy (T therapy) seems to be a simple and convenient way to increase BMD and improve the condition of osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effects of T therapy in increasing BMD among older men with low serum testosterone concentrations. METHODS:A comprehensive search in the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Central databases was undertaken for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of T therapy on osteoporosis in aging men. Primary outcome measures were the change in BMD, bone turnover markers, prostate symptoms, body composition, metabolic and endocrine system markers. The final search was performed in October 2018. RESULTS:Seven RCTs were included. A total of 800 patients met the inclusion criteria. T therapy did not significantly reverse the trend toward decreasing BMD in the spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle and the whole body, with the exception of the trochanter and total hip. In addition, T therapy increased prostate size, lean mass, sex hormone levels; reduced HDL concentration; and had no statistical effect on prostate symptoms, body composition, serum hormones and metabolism. CONCLUSION:T therapy is not effective in increasing BMD in older men. In addition, it has limited effects on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), body mass index (BMI), fat mass, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-VitD and lipid metabolism, although it can increase prostate size, lean mass, and sex hormone levels, and reduce glucose levels and HDL concentrations."}

The major concern is the effects caused by the inappropriate use of the substances, such as hypertension, myocardial ischemia, and left ventricle hypertrophy. The objective of the present research was to measure the diameter of the left ventricle lumen and the thickness of the left ventricle myocardium in mice submitted to supraphysiological doses of AAS. A total of 30 female Swiss mice were used in the experiments. The animals received supraphysiological doses of the AAS for 30\u202fdays, and during the treatment period, they were put to swim in intercalated days. After treatment animals were euthanized and slides were made from the hearts for measurements. Results demonstrated that both AAS changed significantly the heart morphology: Testosterone cypionate led to an increase in the ventricular lumen and stanozolol increased left ventricle myocardium thickness. In conclusion, the use of AAS in supraphysiological doses can change the heart morphology and can lead to serious health consequences."}
{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "The role of androgenic steroids on ovarian development has attracted much attention in recent years, but the molecular mechanism is still largely unknown. In this study, using zebrafish as a model, we found that the trace metal zinc mediates the action of androgen on oocyte maturation. The ovarian and serum testosterone is transiently stimulated by LH during oocyte maturation. Testosterone could mimic the action of LH on oocyte maturation, and its action appears to be independent of the classical nuclear androgen receptor. Consistent with a recent finding that a zinc transporter (Zip9) has been suggested as a novel androgen receptor, we found the labile zinc concentration could be induced by testosterone in the ovarian follicular cells, and zinc could mimic the action of testosterone on oocyte maturation and signaling. Moreover, the action of testosterone on oocyte maturation could be abolished by the chelation of zinc. Thus, the evidence supports the notion that zinc could mediate the action of androgen on oocyte maturation in zebrafish. This finding would shed light on understanding the role of androgen in ovary development and the molecular mechanism of oocyte maturation in fish."}
{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is a functional marker of fetal Sertoli cells. The germ cell number in adults depends on the number of Sertoli cells produced during perinatal development. Recently, AMH has received increasing attention in research of disorders related to male fertility. This paper reviews and summarizes the articles on the regulation of AMH in males and the serum levels of AMH in male fertility-related disorders. We have determined that follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) promotes AMH transcription in the absence of androgen signaling. Testosterone inhibits the transcriptional activation of AMH. The undetectable levels of serum AMH and testosterone levels indicate a lack of functional testicular tissue, for example, that in patients with anorchia or severe Klinefelter syndrome suffering from impaired spermatogenesis. The normal serum testosterone level and undetectable AMH are highly suggestive of persistent M\u00fcllerian duct syndrome (PMDS), combined with clinical manifestations. The levels of both AMH and testosterone are always subnormal in patients with mixed disorders of sex development (DSD). Mixed DSD is an early-onset complete type of disorder with fetal hypogonadism resulting from the dysfunction of both Leydig and Sertoli cells. Serum AMH levels are varying in patients with male fertility-related disorders, including pubertal delay, severe congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, nonobstructive azoospermia, Klinefelter syndrome, varicocele, McCune-Albright syndrome, and male senescence."}

By acting on similar brain circuits, they might interactively influence human behavior. The current study investigates the causal role of testosterone on aggression-related brain activity and the potential interaction with the MAOA polymorphism. In a double-blind process, 93 healthy males received a testosterone or placebo gel. In an fMRI session, participants performed a Taylor aggression paradigm in which they received provoking feedback and could afterwards decide how aggressively they would react. Testosterone and cortisol levels as well as subjective anger were assessed prior and after the task. Circulating testosterone levels were higher in carriers of the long compared to the short MAOA allele. An interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and testosterone administration was identified in the cuneus, where short allele carriers in the placebo group showed diminished activity in the decision period. Task-related anger was significantly higher in this group. Overall, a mesocorticolimbic network was implicated in processing of high versus low provoking feedback, and core hubs of the default mode network were implicated in the subsequent decision after high versus low provocation. Testosterone administration increased activation in this network. The data provides evidence for an interaction of the MAOA polymorphism and exogenous testosterone on anger and suggests that interactive effects on the brain signal could underlie differential emotional reactivity. The increased default mode activation in the testosterone group suggests an enhanced engagement of social cognition related regions possibly supporting responsivity towards social provocation."}

To ensure that hormone measurements are biologically meaningful, method validations are highly recommended for each new species or sample matrix. Our aim was to validate three commonly used enzyme immunoassays (EIA), one for analysis of cortisol and two for analysis of testosterone, to assess adrenocortical and gonadal activity, respectively, from the urine of male Barbary macaques. We compared EIA and liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results to determine if the EIA measurements truly reflect levels of the target hormone and to determine if cross-reactivities with other steroids were potentially confounding results. Furthermore, we conducted a biological validation of testosterone to ensure that both EIA and LC-MS were able to capture physiologically meaningful differences in hormone levels. We found that cortisol measured by EIA correlated strongly with cortisol measured by LC-MS in both adult and immature males, without the need for deconjugation of steroids in the urine. Both testosterone EIAs correlated strongly with LC-MS in adult males, but only if steroids in the urine were deconjugated by enzymatic hydrolysis prior to analysis. However, in immature males, EIA and LC-MS results did not correlate significantly. Further correlation analyses suggest this is likely due to cross-reactivity of the testosterone antibody with other adrenal steroids such as cortisol, DHEA, and likely others, which are present at much higher concentrations relative to testosterone in immature males. Testosterone levels were significantly higher in adult compared to immature males as measured by LC-MS but not as measured by EIA. Taken together, our results suggest that the testosterone EIAs are suitable to assess gonadal activity in adult but not immature males, and only if a hydrolysis of the urine is conducted prior to analysis."}

Those studies were mostly conducted on recreational runners and identified reduced testosterone, but not concentrations low enough to be considered pathological. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the basal concentrations of testosterone and cortisol in elite triathletes, as well as the impact of a World Championship race, on the acute responses of these hormones. METHODS:A total of 22 men (age 40.6 [11.5]\u00a0y, height 179 [6]\u00a0cm, weight 77.0 [7.0]\u00a0kg) who participated in the 2011 Ironman World Championships served as subjects. Resting blood samples were taken 2-4 d prior to provide a baseline (BL), as well as immediately, 1 d, and 2 d after the event and were later analyzed for total testosterone and cortisol concentrations. RESULTS:At BL, 9 men had a normal testosterone concentration, whereas 9 men fell within a \"gray zone\" and 4 other men demonstrated concentrations suggestive of deficiency. Testosterone was significantly lower than BL at 1 d (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.34, P\u2009<\u2009.001, ES\u2009=\u20090.53) and 2 d (95% CI 0.01-0.21, P\u2009=\u2009.034, ES\u2009=\u20090.35) after the event. Cortisol was significantly different from BL at immediate post (95% CI 1.07-0.83, P\u2009<\u2009.001, ES\u2009=\u20098.0). There were significant correlations between time and age (R\u2009=\u2009.68, P\u2009=\u2009.001), as well as BL testosterone and cortisol (R\u2009=\u2009.51, P\u2009=\u2009.015).

Inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system is involved in vascular dysfunction and hypertension. This study evaluated the role of androgens (testosterone) in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced increase in blood pressure, vascular reactivity, and cardiac hypertrophy. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats underwent sham operation, castration, or castration with testosterone replacement. After 12 weeks of chronic changes in androgen status, Ang II (120 ng/kg per minute) or saline was infused for 28 days via subcutaneous miniosmotic pump, and changes in blood pressure was measured. Vascular reactivity and Ang II receptor levels were examined in mesenteric arteries. Heart weight, cardiac ANP mRNA levels, and fibrosis were also assessed. Ang II infusion increased arterial pressure in intact males. The Ang II-induced increase in hypertensive response was prevented in castrated males. Testosterone replacement in castrated males restored Ang II-induced hypertensive responses. Castration reduced vascular AT1R/AT2R ratio, an effect that was reversed by testosterone replacement. Ang II-induced hypertension was associated with increased contractile response of mesenteric arteries to Ang II and phenylephrine in intact and testosterone-replaced castrated males; these increases were prevented in castrated males. Ang II infusion induced increased left ventricle-to-body weight ratio and ANP mRNA expression, indicators of left ventricular hypertrophy, and fibrosis in intact and testosterone-replaced castrated males, and castration prevented the increase in these parameters caused by Ang II. This study demonstrates that testosterone plays a permissive role in development and maintenance of Ang II-induced vascular dysfunction, hypertension, and cardiac hypertrophy."}

However, information on the prognostic implication in patients at high cardiovascular risk with dysglycaemia is inconsistent. The study objective was to determine whether testosterone and/or sex hormone-binding globulin predict cardiovascular events or death in dysglycaemic patients. METHODS:Dysglycaemic males at high cardiovascular risk ( n\u2009=\u20095553) who participated in the Outcome Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial and provided baseline blood samples were studied. Testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were measured at baseline and used to estimate free testosterone. Low levels of total and free testosterone were defined as \u2264300\u2009ng/dl and \u22647\u2009ng/dl, respectively. Patients were followed for six years for cardiovascular events (defined as the composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) and all-cause mortality. RESULTS:The mean total and free testosterone levels were 416.6\u2009ng/dl and 8.4\u2009ng/dl, and low levels were present in 13% and 37% of the patients. The median sex hormone-binding globulin level was 35\u2009nmol/l. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, previous diseases and pharmacological treatment, neither total nor free testosterone predicted cardiovascular events. However, a one-standard-deviation increase in sex hormone-binding globulin predicted both cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 1.07; 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.14; p\u2009=\u20090.03) and all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.21; p\u2009<\u20090.01).

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "NEW FINDINGS:What is the central question of this study? Compared to males, adult females have protective mechanisms against obesity and metabolic syndrome. Although some metabolic diseases are influenced by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), a possible sexual dimorphism in the occurrence of hepatic ER stress has not been reported thus far. What is the main finding and its importance? The transition from the prepubertal to the adult age is associated with an increase in the unfolded protein response markers in the liver of male rats, which is probably due to the increase in serum testosterone levels. ABSTRACT:Male rodents present a higher predisposition to obesity and insulin resistance than females. These disorders have been associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To investigate a possible sexual dimorphism in the hepatic occurrence of ER stress, we evaluated the expression of ER stress markers in the livers of male and female rats in two phases of sexual development. In the first experimental model, male and female prepubertal and adult Wistar rats were used. Adult males presented higher body mass and greater mass of the adipose tissue and liver than adult females. Prepubertal animals presented no differences in these parameters between males and females. Despite this finding, the hepatic expression levels of Bip, Ire1\u03b1 and Xbp1s mRNA were lower in prepubertal males than in females, while in adult animals, they did not differ between sexes. In the second experimental model, we anticipated the sexually mature phase by daily injections of testosterone propionate for 10 days in prepubertal males or by daily injections of oestradiol benzoate for 7 days in prepubertal females. Oestradiol administration in prepubertal females did not change any of the parameters evaluated. Testosterone administration to prepubertal males led to a higher body mass and greater expression of Bip, Ire1\u03b1, Atf4 and Xbp1s in the liver. These findings suggest that the increased ER stress predisposition observed in males during puberty is due to an increase in testosterone levels, indicating that ER stress is sexually dimorphic before puberty due to the lack of testosterone in males.

We aimed to investigate the association between circulating total testosterone (TT) and glycaemic variability using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in patients with T2D. METHODS:A total of 248 men with T2D were enrolled in the study. Clinical characteristics and plasma for glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and C-peptide assessment were collected. TT was measured using a chemiluminescent immunometric assay. All patients were subjected to a 3-day CGM before making adjustments for hypoglycaemic therapy. RESULTS:TT positively correlated with the standard deviation of mean blood glucose (SDBG) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), especially in older patients. Linear regression analysis showed that SDBG was associated with HbA1c (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.354, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and TT (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.164, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) after adjusting for age, duration of diabetes, body mass index, fasting/postprandial C-peptide, and use of different hypoglycaemic drugs. The cut-off value of TT for predicting glycaemic variability was 14.76\u00a0mmol/L according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. SDBG, the coefficient of variation, the incremental area under the curve of glucose (AUC)\u00a0>\u00a010\u00a0mmol/L, and AUC night were increased in the group with TT\u00a0>\u00a014.76\u00a0nmol/L (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for all variables).

Testosterone has been associated with MDD and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in men, although associations in women are less clear. Therefore, we investigated whether testosterone is associated with MetS and whether this association is different for depressed and non-depressed older men and women. METHODS:In this prospective cohort study, 478 participants (349 patients with MDD and 129 controls) aged between 60 and 93\u00a0years from the Netherlands Study of Depression in Older Persons were included. Total testosterone (TT) and sex-hormone binding globulin levels were measured using a second-generation radioimmune assay. Free testosterone (FT) was calculated based on TT. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. RESULTS:A higher risk for MetS was found in men with low FT and TT (odds ratio [OR]: 0.67, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.47-0.95 and OR: 0.51, 95%CI: 0.34-0.75), and in women with high FT (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.08-1.82). Strong associations in the same direction were found with adiposity, glucose, and plasma lipid MetS components at baseline, but not with changes in these components at 2-year follow-up. The associations did not significantly differ between MDD patients and controls. CONCLUSIONS:Independently of having MDD, low testosterone levels in men and, in contrast, high testosterone levels in women were significantly associated with MetS and its components."}

Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that men with AAA have lower serum testosterone compared to men without AAA, suggesting the preventive roles of testosterone. However, underlying mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we investigated effects of testosterone administration on the formation of AAA using in vivo model. In wild-type mice (C57BL/6J, male, 12 week-old), testosterone deficiency was induced by castration. At 4 weeks after castration, AAA was induced by CaCl2 application in infrarenal aorta and angiotensinII (2000 ng/kg/min) infusion for 4 weeks. Testosterone (5 and 10 mg/kg) or control oil was administered to AAA-induced mice with castration for 8 weeks. When AAA was induced, castrated mice showed remarkable AAA formation compared to sham mice. Testosterone administration significantly prevent AAA formation. Histological analysis revealed that infiltration of F4/80-positive macrophages was seen in the developed AAA of castrated mice. We further found that circulating IL-6 and aortic IL-6 expression were elevated and aortic STAT3 phosphorylation was increased, suggesting IL-6/STAT3-dependent inflammatory responses are attributed to AAA formation in castrated mice. Testosterone administration significantly inhibited expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, IL-1b in aorta. These results demonstrate that testosterone deficiency proceeds AAA by IL-6/STAT3-mediated inflammation and conversely, administration of testosterone could prevent AAA formation through inhibition of inflammation. Uncovering the effects of testosterone on inflammation in vessel provides mechanistic insight into the cardioprotective effects of testosterone."}

Progesterone deficiency is a hormone imbalance that could lead to luteal-phase deficiency, which is a common problem in assisted reproductive technologies. Testosterone has been explored for treating postmenopausal symptoms, such as vaginal atrophy. The ex vivo experiments were performed using porcine vaginal mucosa and phosphate buffered saline + 0.5% 2-hydroxypropyl-\u00df-cyclodextrin as the receptor media, which was later quantified through high-performance liquid chromatography. The percentage of the permeated drug was 0.4% and 20.3% for progesterone and testosterone, respectively. The permeation studies revealed that testosterone formulated with Pentravan is potentially effective in reaching the bloodstream and acts locally, whereas progesterone was mostly retained in the mucosa."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "Aims:The effects of testosterone on cardiovascular disease (CVD) as reported in literature have been ambiguous. Recently, the interplay between testosterone and oestradiol as assessed by testosterone/oestradiol (T/E2) ratio was suggested to be better informative on the normal physiological balance. Considering the role in CVD, we hypothesized that a low T/E2 ratio in men with CVD is associated with increased inflammation, a more unstable plaque and a worse cardiovascular outcome. Methods and results:Testosterone and oestradiol concentrations were determined in blood samples of 611 male carotid endarterectomy patients included in the Athero-Express Biobank Study. T/E2 ratio was associated with baseline characteristics, atherosclerotic plaque specimens, inflammatory biomarkers, and 3 year follow-up information. Patients with low T/E2 ratio had more unfavourable inflammatory profiles compared with patients with high T/E2 as observed by higher levels of C-reactive protein [2.81\u2009\u03bcg/mL vs. 1.22\u2009\u03bcg/mL (P\u2009<\u20090.001)] and higher leucocyte counts [8.98*109/L vs. 7.75*109/L (P\u2009=\u20090.001)] in blood. In atherosclerotic plaques, a negative association between T/E2 ratio and number of neutrophils [B = -0.366 (P\u2009=\u20090.012)], plaque calcifications [OR: 0.816 (P\u2009=\u20090.044)], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [B = -0.15 (P\u2009=\u20090.009)], and IL-6 receptor [B = -0.13 (P\u2009=\u20090.024)] was found. Furthermore, in multivariate Cox regression analysis, low T/E2 ratio was independently associated with an increased risk for major cardiovascular events (MACE) during 3 year follow-up [hazard ratio 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.02-2.76), P\u2009=\u20090.043]. In men with elevated body mass index (BMI), these effects were strongest. Conclusion:In male patients with manifest atherosclerotic disease, low T/E2 ratio was associated with increased systemic inflammation, increased inflammatory plaque proteins, and an increased risk of future MACE as compared to men with normal T/E2 ratio. These effects are strongest in men with elevated BMI and are expected to be affected by aromatase activity in white fat tissues. Normalization of T/E2 ratio may be considered as target for the secondary prevention of CVD in men."}

We describe the clinical and hormonal features of a series of children who were referred to endocrine evaluation due to premature pubarche. METHODS:This is a retrospective case series study of 14 children with premature pubarche and/or virilization. Five were unintentionally exposed to testosterone gel (parental use). Nine patients were intensely exposed to diaper rash prevention creams. Clinical and laboratory data were revised. RESULTS:Moderate to severe virilization was detected in the 5 patients (2 boys and 3 girls) who were exposed to testosterone gel. These patients had pubic hair development associated with clitoromegaly (3/3), penile enlargement (2/2), and accelerated growth (5/5). Testosterone levels were elevated in 4/5 patients associated with normal prepubertal gonadotropin levels and adrenal androgen precursors. The 9 children who were intensely exposed to diaper rash prevention creams had mild pubarche (intermediate hair) without any other clinical manifestation of pubertal development. Three of them exhibited pubic hair thinning after cream withdrawal. CONCLUSION:Unintentional topical androgen exposure or the intense use of diaper rash prevention cream should be ruled out in children with precocious pubarche and/or virilization signs to avoid misdiagnosis and expendable investigation."}

The body weight (kg), scrotal circumference (cm) and testicular biometry (cm) of post-weaning 18 Osmanabadi male kids was recorded every 15\u00a0days from weaning, i.e., 120\u2009\u00b1\u200910\u00a0days along with serum testosterone (ng/ml) by radioimmunoassay method at monthly intervals for the next 6\u00a0months. Semen was collected six times on the seventh month onward during post-pubertal age at 15-day interval from 18 bucks. The semen was evaluated for macroscopic and microscopic tests. The body weight increased from 14.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.67 to 19.57\u2009\u00b1\u20090.70\u00a0kg from four to nine and a half months of age. The average daily body weight gain was 31.27\u00a0g. Maximum body weight gain was 01.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u00a0kg from 5 to 6 followed by 01.15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.16\u00a0kg from 4 to 5\u00a0months of age. The scrotal circumference increased from 17.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.56 to 19.03\u2009\u00b1\u20090.55\u00a0cm from four to nine and a half months of age with maximum increased between 4 and 5 followed by 6 and 7\u00a0months of age. The testicular length, width and thickness of right and left testicles were recorded by ultrasonography method. There was increase in mean right and left testicular length, width and thickness from 5.25\u2009\u00b1\u20090.19 to 5.84\u2009\u00b1\u20090.18 and 5.49\u2009\u00b1\u20090.21 to 6.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.20; 2.99\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 to 3.32\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 and 3.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13 to 3.44\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 and 2.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 to 3.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 and 3.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.12 to 3.31\u2009\u00b1\u20090.11\u00a0cm, respectively by ultrasonography, between four to nine and a half months of age. Testicular length, width and thickness gain was at maximum in 5 to 6\u00a0months of age. Left testicular length was more than the right testis. Before puberty, there was sudden gain in body weight, testicular length and width. However, scrotal circumference showed significant increase after puberty. Body weight had highest correlation with ultrasonographic left testicular thickness (r\u2009=\u20091) followed by scrotal circumference, ultrasonographic right and left testicular width, left testicular length, right testicular length and thickness and least by right testicular thickness (r\u2009=\u20090.95). The semen was thin to thick in consistency and average semen density was 3.10\u2009\u00b1\u20090.05. Average semen volume was 0.81\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02\u00a0ml, mass activity, initial motility, live and dead sperm count, abnormal sperm count and sperm concentration were 3.45\u2009\u00b1\u20090.13, 76.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.16 and 75.16\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28% and 24.84\u2009\u00b1\u20091.28, 12.30\u2009\u00b1\u20090.50% and 2631.04\u2009\u00b1\u200945.74 million/ml, respectively in 18 bucks in six collection at 15\u00a0days. There was significant rise in semen volume, mass activity, initial motility and concentration at 8.5\u00a0months and live count, density at 9\u00a0months of age which indicates the age of sexual maturity is 8.5 to 9\u00a0months in Osmanabadi bucks. The body weight had highest positive correlation with mass activity (r\u2009=\u200998) followed by initial motility, live sperm count and total sperm concentration, semen volume (r\u2009=\u200976). The scrotal circumference had highest positive correlation with initial motility (r\u2009=\u200998) followed by live sperm count, total sperm count, mass activity, semen volume (r\u2009=\u200986). On the other hand, body weight and scrotal circumference were negatively correlated with abnormal and dead sperm count. The mean testosterone concentration increased from 0.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.004 to 5.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.80\u00a0ng/ml between four and half to nine and half months of age, respectively. There was significant rise (p\u2009<\u20090.01) up to 1.38\u2009\u00b1\u20090.28\u00a0ng/ ml at 6.5\u00a0months, i.e., age of puberty and up to 5.75\u2009\u00b1\u20090.80\u00a0ng/ml at 9.5\u00a0months, i.e., age of sexual maturity. Testosterone had highest positive correlation with testicular length followed by testicular width, length, body weight and scrotal circumference, mass activity, live sperm count, initial motility, while it had highest negative correlation with dead and abnormal sperm count. From the present research work, it was concluded that the scrotal circumference, testicular length, width and thickness increased with increasing body weight. Before puberty, there was sudden gain in body weight, testicular length and width. However, scrotal circumference increased significantly at post-pubertal age. So testicular length, body weight, testicular width in pre pubertal age and scrotal circumference post-pubertal age can be used as indicator for selection of Osmanabadi bucks for breeding purpose. On the other hand, the semen parameters should consider only after 8.5 to 9\u00a0months of age for selection of Osmanabadi bucks for breeding."}

The primary outcome was live birth rate (LBR); secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), miscarriage rate (MR), total and MII oocytes, and total embryos. METHODS:This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluates the effects of testosterone administration before/during COS compared with a control group in patients defined as POR. The primary outcome was live birth rate (LBR); secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), miscarriage rate (MR), total and MII oocytes, and total embryos. Pooled results were expressed as risk ratio (RR) or mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Sources of heterogeneity were investigated through sensitivity and subgroup analysis. All analyses were performed by using the random-effects model. RESULTS:Women receiving testosterone showed higher LBR (RR 2.29, 95% CI 1.31-4.01, p\u2009=\u20090.004), CPR (RR 2.32, 95% CI 1.47-3.64, p\u2009=\u20090.0003), total oocytes (MD\u2009=\u20091.28 [95% CI 0.83, 1.73], p\u2009<\u20090.00001), MII oocytes (MD\u2009=\u20090.96 [95% CI 0.28, 1.65], p\u2009=\u20090.006), and total embryos (MD\u2009=\u20091.17 [95% CI 0.67, 1.67], p\u2009<\u20090.00001) in comparison to controls, with no difference in MR (p\u2009=\u2009ns). Sensitivity and subgroup analysis did not provide statistical changes to the pooled results. CONCLUSIONS:Testosterone therapy seems promising to improve the success at IVF in POR patients. Further RCTs with rigorous methodology and inclusion criteria are still mandatory."}

In birds, maternally-transferred egg substances may exert positive or negative influence over the offspring phenotype. Among these, testosterone can upregulate the bioavailability of certain antioxidants but simultaneously promotes the production of pro-oxidants, leading to an oxidative stress situation, which is one of the main forces causing telomere attrition However, no study has investigated the role of this androgen on telomere dynamics in birds and little is known about the effects of yolk testosterone on oxidative status in early-life of these species. We physiologically increased the levels of yolk testosterone by in ovo injections in yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) to evaluate the effects induced by this androgen on hatchlings plasma total antioxidant capacity, amount of pro-oxidant molecules and telomere length at hatching. Testosterone supplementation did not increase hatchling body growth, did not result in the overproduction of pro-oxidant molecules nor a reduction of antioxidant capacity. Accordingly, telomere length at hatching was not affected by testosterone treatment, although hatchlings from the third-laid eggs showed shorter telomeres than their siblings from first- and second-laid eggs, independently of testosterone treatment. Our results suggest that injection of physiological levels of testosterone does not induce oxidative stress to hatchlings and, consequently do not affect telomere dynamics during early post-natal periods."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "AIMS:Testosterone is implicated as a potential contributing factor to heat-induced injury. We examined effects of testosterone on thermal response of mice to heat exposure. MAIN METHODS:Adult C57BL/6J male mice received gonadectomy or sham surgery subsequent vehicle (Gnx) or testosterone implants (Gnx+T). Body core temperature (Tc) of mice was recorded telemetrically during acute heat exposure. Thermal responses to heat exposure were also examined in age-matched female mice at each stage of the estrous cycle. KEY FINDINGS:Basal Tc was lower in sham male mice than females, but did not differ among sham, Gnx or Gnx+T males. No alterations in expression of uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 in the gastrocnemius muscle were found in either Gnx or Gnx+T mice compared to sham males. During heat exposure, sham male mice had a faster and greater rise in Tc, compared to females. This rapid hyperthermic response to heat was abolished in Gnx males, but not in Gnx+T males. No significant correlation was revealed between peak Tc values and plasma testosterone concentrations in Gnx+T males treated with either low- or high-dose testosterone. No effects of estrous cycle phase on the thermal response to heat exposure were detected in female mice. SIGNIFICANCE:We found that male mice were more susceptible to development of heat-induced hyperthermia than females and this was prevented by castration, not by castration with testosterone replacement. These results suggest that testosterone mediates heat-induced hyperthermia and is a heat stress susceptibility factor."}

{"keyword": "Testosterone", "texts": "BACKGROUND:GATA4 is a transcription factor essential for male sex determination, testicular differentiation during fetal development, and male fertility in the adult. GATA4 exerts part of its function by regulating multiple genes in the steroidogenic enzyme pathway. In spite of these crucial roles, how the activity of this factor is regulated remains unclear. OBJECTIVES:Studies in gonadal cell lines have shown that GATA4 is phosphorylated on at least two serine residues-serine 105 (S105) and serine 261 (S261)-and that this phosphorylation is important for GATA4 activity. The objective of the present study is to characterize the endogenous role of GATA4 S105 and S261 phosphorylation in the mouse testis. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We examined both previously described GATA4 S105A mice and a novel GATA4 S261A knock-in mouse that we generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The male phenotype of the mutants was characterized by assessing androgen-dependent organ weights, hormonal profiles, and expression of multiple testicular target genes using standard biochemical and molecular biology techniques. RESULTS:The fecundity of crosses between GATA4 S105A mice was reduced but without a change in sex ratio. The weight of androgen-dependent organs was smaller when compared to wild-type controls. Plasma testosterone levels showed a 70% decrease in adult GATA4 S105A males. This decrease was associated with a reduction in Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd17b3 expression. GATA4 S261A mice were viable and testis morphology appeared normal. Testosterone production and steroidogenic enzyme expression were not altered in GATA4 S261A males. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:Our analysis showed that blocking GATA4 S105 phosphorylation is associated with decreased androgen production in males. In contrast, S261 phosphorylation by itself is dispensable for GATA4 function. These results confirm that endogenous GATA4 action is essential for normal steroid production in males and that this activity requires phosphorylation on at least one serine residue."}

Using data from the PFT and the overall TTrials study population, we also aimed to identify whether the effect of testosterone on mobility differed according to baseline walking speed, mobility limitation, or other participant-level factors. METHODS:The TTrials included 790 men aged 65 years or older and with an average of two total testosterone concentrations below 275 ng/dL (9\u00b75 nmol/L), of whom 390 had mobility limitation and a walking speed below 1\u00b72 m/s and were enrolled in the PFT. Participants were assigned (by minimisation method) to 1% testosterone gel or placebo gel daily for 12 months, with participants and study staff masked to intervention allocation. The primary outcome of the PFT was an increase in 6 min walk test (6MWT) distance of 50 m or more. Here we report data for absolute change in 6MWT distance and physical component of Short Form-36 (PF10), and for PGIC and falls. Data are reported for men enrolled in the PFT and those who were not, and for all men in TTrials; data are also reported according to baseline walking speed and mobility limitation. Analyses were done in a modified intention-to-treat population in all patients who were allocated to treatment, had a baseline assessment, and at least one post-intervention assessment. The TTrials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00799617. FINDINGS:The TTrials took place between April 28, 2011 and June 16, 2014. Of 790 TTrials participants, 395 were allocated to testosterone and 395 to placebo; of the 390 participants enrolled in the PFT, 193 were allocated to testosterone and 197 to placebo. As reported previously, 6MWT distance improved significantly more in the testosterone than in the placebo group among all men in the TTrials, but not in those who were enrolled in the PFT; among TTrials participants not enrolled in the PFT, 6MWT distance improved with a treatment effect of 8\u00b79 m (95% CI 2\u00b72-15\u00b76; p=0\u00b7010). As reported previously, PF10 improved more in the testosterone group than in the placebo group in all men in TTrials and in men enrolled in the PFT; among those not enrolled in the PFT, PF10 improved with an effect size of 4\u00b70 (1\u00b75-6\u00b75; p=0\u00b70019). Testosterone-treated men with baseline walking speed of 1\u00b72 m/s or higher had significantly greater improvements in 6MWT distance (treatment effect 14\u00b72 m, 6\u00b75-21\u00b79; p=0\u00b70004) and PF10 (4\u00b79, 2\u00b72-7\u00b77; p=0\u00b70005) than placebo-treated men. Testosterone-treated men reporting mobility limitation showed significantly more improvement in 6MWT distance (7\u00b76 m, 1\u00b70-14\u00b71; p=0\u00b70237) and PF10 (3\u00b76, 1\u00b73-5\u00b79; p=0\u00b70018) than placebo-treated men. Men in the testosterone group were more likely to perceive improvement in their walking ability (PGIC) than men in the placebo group, both for men enrolled in the PFT (effect size 2\u00b721, 1\u00b735-3\u00b763; p=0\u00b70018) and those not enrolled in the PFT (3\u00b701, 1\u00b761-5\u00b763; p=0\u00b70006). Changes in 6MWT distance were significantly associated with changes in testosterone, free testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and haemoglobin concentrations. Fall frequency during the intervention period was identical in the two treatment groups of the TTrials (103 [27%] of 380 analysed in both groups had at least one fall). INTERPRETATION:Testosterone therapy consistently improved self-reported walking ability, modestly improved 6MWT distance (across all TTtrials participants), but did not affect falls. The effect of testosterone on mobility measures were related to baseline gait speed and self-reported mobility limitation, and changes in testosterone and haemoglobin concentrations.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:Comorbidities of men undergoing TURP for BPH from 2004-15 were assessed with the validated ACTIONS phenotype totaling a score from 0-2 for each domain (Anxiety, Cardiovascular, Testosterone, Insulin/diabetes, Obesity, Neurologic, Sleep apnea). BPH medication discontinuation, change in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), post-void residual (PVR), and patient satisfaction were assessed. Descriptive and comparative statistics were calculated with significance set at p<0.05. RESULTS:The 319 men had a median age of 74.0 (IQR 67-78). Mean ACTIONS score was significantly lower in men who discontinued alpha-blockers or 5-alpha reductase inhibitors compared to those who did not (3.37\u00b12.14 vs 4.79\u00b12.75, p<0.0001). ACTIONS score < 4 was significantly associated with medication discontinuation (p=0.0014). Lower scores in Testosterone (p=0.04), Neurologic (p=0.003), and Sleep apnea (p=0.04) domains were significantly associated with medication discontinuation. Total ACTIONS score was not independently associated with changes in IPSS or PVR. CONCLUSIONS:Lower ACTIONS score was associated with BPH medication discontinuation after TURP, suggesting men with lower comorbidity burdens do better after the procedure. The ACTIONS phenotype score is easily calculated and may aid the preoperative counseling of men undergoing TURP for BPH."}

N-Glycanase, encoded by the gene NGLY1, is an important enzyme involved in protein deglycosylation of misfolded proteins. Deglycosylation of misfolded proteins precedes the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) process. NGLY1 patients produce little or no N-glycanase (Ngly1), and the symptoms include global developmental delay, frequent seizures, complex hyperkinetic movement disorder, difficulty in swallowing/aspiration, liver dysfunction, and a lack of tears. Unfortunately, there has not been any therapeutic option available for this rare disease so far. Recently, a proposed molecular mechanism for NGLY1 deficiency suggested that endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase) inhibitors may be promising therapeutics for NGLY1 patients. Herein, we performed structure-based virtual screening utilizing FDA-approved drug database on this ENGase target to enable repurposing of existing drugs. Several Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs), a series of substituted 1H-benzo [d] imidazole, and 1H-imidazo [4,5-b] pyridines, among other scaffolds, have been identified as potent ENGase inhibitors. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was employed to assess the inhibition of ENGase activity by these PPIs. Our efforts led to the discovery of Rabeprazole Sodium as the most promising hit with an IC50 of 4.47\u00b10.44\u03bcM. This is the first report that describes the discovery of small molecule ENGase inhibitors, which can potentially be used for the treatment of human NGLY1 deficiency."}

Although the toxicity profile of fluconazole has been evaluated in clinical trials, there are scant data regarding its tolerability with long-term therapy. Treatment guidelines for coccidioidomycosis recommend fluconazole therapy and severe or disseminated infections can require lifelong treatment. OBJECTIVES:To assess the prevalence of long-term fluconazole adverse effects, their consequences for antifungal therapy, time to adverse effects and the association between dosing regimen or fluconazole serum level and adverse effect status. METHODS:We conducted a single-centre, retrospective study of adult patients (\u226518\u2009years) with proven or probable coccidioidomycosis receiving long-term fluconazole therapy for an intended duration of \u226528\u2009days. RESULTS:Out of 124 patients included, 64 (51.6%) experienced adverse effects. The most common adverse effects were xerosis (16.9%), alopecia (16.1%) and fatigue (11.3%). Of the 64 patients experiencing adverse effects, 42 (65.6%) required a therapeutic intervention such as dose reduction, discontinuation or switch to a new antifungal. Patients experiencing adverse effects were prescribed higher total daily fluconazole doses (6.7 versus 5.7\u2009mg/kg; P\u2009<\u20090.01). The median therapeutic drug levels did not differ significantly between patients who experienced adverse effects and those who did not (36.1 versus 28.1\u2009mg/L; P\u2009=\u20090.35). CONCLUSIONS:A significant number of patients receiving long-term fluconazole therapy for coccidioidomycosis experienced adverse effects. Of these, around two-thirds required a therapeutic change. We believe these findings are representative of the adverse effect profile of long-term fluconazole therapy as it is used in clinical practice for coccidioidomycosis as opposed to use in clinical trials."}
{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Objectives:The emergence of fluconazole resistance in Candida parapsilosis healthcare-associated infections has recently been increasingly reported. Antifungal susceptibility profiles and mechanisms of fluconazole resistance in C. parapsilosis (n\u2009=\u2009199) from nine hospitals in India collected over a period of 3\u2009years were studied. Further, clonal transmission of fluconazole-resistant isolates in different hospitals was investigated. Methods:Antifungal susceptibility testing of five azoles, amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine was performed by the CLSI microbroth dilution method. The azole target ERG11 gene was sequenced, and the significance of a novel ERG11 mutation in C. parapsilosis was determined using a gap-repair cloning approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, microsatellite analysis was performed to determine the clonal lineage of C. parapsilosis-resistant strains circulating among different hospitals. Results:A total of 64 (32%) C. parapsilosis isolates were non-susceptible to fluconazole, which included resistant (n\u2009=\u200955; MIC >4\u2009mg/L) and susceptible dose-dependent (n\u2009=\u20099) isolates. Of these 64 non-susceptible isolates, a novel K143R amino acid substitution was noted in 92%, and the remaining five isolates had the Y132F substitution. Elevated azole MICs (\u226516-fold) were detected in S. cerevisiae upon expression of C. parapsilosis ERG11 alleles carrying Y132F or K143R substitutions. Two major clusters of non-susceptible isolates were circulating in seven Indian hospitals. Conclusions:We report a novel K143R amino acid substitution in ERG11p causing fluconazole resistance in C. parapsilosis. Fluconazole-non-susceptible C. parapsilosis isolates carrying the novel K143R amino acid substitution should be identified in clinical microbiology laboratories to prevent further clonal transmission."}

Fluconazole-loaded proniosomal gels were prepared by the coacervation phase separation method using different nonionic surfactants (spans and tweens). The prepared fluconazole proniosomal gels were evaluated for various parameters such as particle size (PS), drug entrapment efficiency percentage (EE%), and in vitro drug release. The experimental results showed that the EE% for the prepared formulae are acceptable (85.14%-97.66%) and they are nanosized (19.8-50.1 nm) and the diffusion from the gels gave the desired sustaining effect. F4, which was prepared from span 60, tween 80 (1:1), and cholesterol showed highest EE% and gave slow release (40.50% \u00b1 1.50% after 6 h), was subjected to zeta potential (ZP) test, transmission electron microscopy as well as microbiological study. The results showed a well-defined spherical vesicle with sharp boundaries with good physical stability of fluconazole within the prepared gel. Moreover, F4 showed an excellent microbiological activity represented by a greater zone of inhibition (5.3 cm) compared to control gel (fluconazole in 2% hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) gel formula) (4.2 cm) and plain gel with no drug (0 cm) against Candida albicans. This study showed the suitability of the proniosomal gel in attaining the desired sustainment effect for topical delivery of fluconazole for the management of fungal infection. The physical stability study showed that there was no significant change in EE%, PS, and ZP of fluconazole proniosomal gel after storage for 6 months."}

Twenty-three C. albicans clinical isolates were collected from two hospitals in Shanghai, China. Antifungal susceptibility tests were performed on biofilm and planktonic cells. A crystal violet assay was used to monitor biofilm growth. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantify the expression of the transporter-related genes MDR1, CDR1, and CDR2 as well as ERG11, a gene encoding an enzyme targeted by antifungal drugs. Fluconazole resistance was shown to increase in biofilm in a time-dependent manner. No significant differences were observed between different strains of C. albicans. Genes encoding efflux pumps were overexpressed in early stages of biofilm formation and could also be induced by fluconazole. While ERG11 was not upregulated in biofilm, it was overexpressed upon the addition of fluconazole to biofilm and planktonic cells. Gene expression also appeared to be related to the original genotype of the strain. The upregulation of genes encoding efflux pumps demonstrates their role in the development of fluconazole resistance during the early stages of C. albicans biofilm formation."}

To investigate the influence of different triazoles (voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole) on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics. Adjusted physicochemical data and pharmacokinetic parameters of voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and tamoxifen were obtained from published literatures. PBPK models were built and verified in healthy subjects using GastroPlus\u2122. Voriconazole, itraconazole, and tamoxifen were administered orally. Fluconazole was administered intravenously. Simulated plasma concentration-time curves of the voriconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and tamoxifen showed good agreement with the observed profiles, respectively. The DDI simulations showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters of tamoxifen were increased by various degrees when coadministered with different triazoles. In healthy subjects, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to t h (AUC0-t) of tamoxifen was increased by 41%, 5%, and1% when coadministrated with voriconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole, respectively. The PBPK models adequately characterized the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen and triazoles. Among the three triazoles, voriconazole exhibited the greatest effect on tamoxifen pharmacokinetics. In clinical practice, an effective dosage adjustment of tamoxifen may need to be considered and TDM for tamoxifen is advisable to guide dosing and optimize therapy when coadministered with voriconazole."}

The complete phenotype is characterized by hypophosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis, leading to chronic kidney disease and osteoporosis in adults. We report a 15-year-old boy referred for nephrocalcinosis.

Fluconazole, an inhibitor of 1\u03b1-hydroxylase, was effective in normalizing calciuria without decreasing glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that children with SLC334A3 mutations can present with a less-typical phenotype, having normal serum phosphate levels and normal renal phosphate reabsorption.

Fluconazole is a first-generation triazole antifungal used in the treatment of several fungal infections including coccidioidomycosis. Treatment guidelines for coccidioidomycosis recommend high-dose fluconazole and severe or disseminated infections frequently require greater than 1 year of therapy. Although the toxicity profile of fluconazole has been evaluated in clinical trials, there is a paucity of data regarding the tolerability of this agent with long-term therapy.MethodsWe conducted a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients (\u226518 years) with proven or probable coccidioidomycosis between 2010 and 2018 receiving long-term fluconazole therapy for an intended duration of 28 days or greater. Outcomes: (1) Incidence and type of adverse events. (2) Result of adverse event on treatment course. (3) Association between adverse events and therapeutic drug levels. (4) Association between adverse events and fluconazole dose. (5) Efficacy of fluconazole therapy via modified Mycoses Study Group criteria.

Forty-eight patients (48.9%) experienced adverse effects directly attributed to fluconazole therapy by the evaluating physician. The most common adverse effects were xerosis (19.4%), alopecia (16.3%), fatigue (10.2%), and arthralgia (6.1%).

We sought to better understand the effect of prophylactic fluconazole on a selection of fluconazole-resistant Candida species. Methods:We evaluated the susceptibility to fluconazole of Candida isolates from premature infants (<750\u2009g birth weight) enrolled in a multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of fluconazole prophylaxis. Candida species were isolated through surveillance cultures at baseline (study day 0-7), period 1 (study day 8-28) and period 2 (study day 29-49). Fluconazole MICs were determined for all Candida isolates. Results:Three hundred and sixty-one infants received fluconazole (n\u2009=\u2009188) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009173). After the baseline period, Candida colonization was significantly lower in the fluconazole group compared with placebo during periods 1 (5% versus 27%; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 2 (3% versus 27%; P\u2009<\u20090.001). After the baseline period, two infants (1%) were colonized with at least one fluconazole-resistant Candida in each group. Median fluconazole MIC was similar in both treatment groups at baseline and period 1. However, in period 2, median MIC was higher in the fluconazole group compared with placebo (1.00 versus 0.50\u2009mg/L, P\u2009=\u20090.01).

Whereas weak trailing (<25% of the positive growth control) is common and found not to impair fluconazole efficacy, we investigated if more pronounced trailing impacted treatment efficacy. Fluconazole efficacy against two weakly (\u226425% growth), two moderately (26% to 50% growth), and one heavily (>70% growth) trailing resistant isolate and one resistant (100% growth) isolate were investigated in vitro and in vivo (in a Galleria mellonella survival model and two nonlethal murine models). CDR1 expression levels and ERG11 sequences were characterized. The survival in fluconazole-treated G. mellonella was inversely correlated with the degree of trailing (71% to 9% survival in treatment groups). In mice, resistant and heavily trailing isolates responded poorly to fluconazole treatment. CDR1 expression was significantly higher in trailing and resistant isolates than in wild-type isolates (1.4-fold to 10-fold higher). All isolates exhibited ERG11 wild-type alleles. Heavily trailing isolates were less responsive to fluconazole in all in vivo models, indicating an impact on fluconazole efficacy. CDR1 upregulation may have contributed to the observed differences. Moderately trailing isolates responded less well to fluconazole in larvae only. This confirms clinical data suggesting fluconazole is effective against infections with such isolates in less severely ill patients and supports the current 50% growth endpoint for susceptibility testing. However, it is still unclear if the gradual loss of efficacy observed for moderately trailing isolates in the larva model may be a reason for concern in selected vulnerable patient populations."}

Microcolonies were a common phenomenon among Candida isolates following incubation on RPMI agar, with a higher frequency among C. albicans isolates as compared to non-albicans Candida across generations (57-93% vs 31-93%, respectively) and a similar fluconazole susceptibility rate over three generations. The rate of microcolonies was similar in both patients with successful and unsuccessful outcome (41%\u00a0vs 42%, respectively). Microcolonies are a common phenomenon.

Despite its extensive use, reports on its genotoxic/mutagenic effects are controversial; therefore, further studies are needed to better clarify such effects. African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were exposed in vitro to different concentrations of fluconazole and were then evaluated for different parameters, such as cytotoxicity (MTT/cell death by fluorescent dyes), genotoxicity/mutagenicity (comet assay/micronucleus test), and induction of oxidative stress (DCFH-DA assay). Fluconazole was used at concentrations of 81.6, 163.2, 326.5, 653, 1306, and 2612.1\u03bcM for the MTT assay and 81.6, 326.5, and 1306\u03bcM for the remaining assays.

First, Isolates were identified by ITS sequencing and then, MICs of fluconazole, isavuconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, anidulafungin, micafungin, and amphotericin-B were determined by EUCAST and SensititreYeastOne\u00ae (SYO) (only bloodstream isolates), and Liofilchem\u00ae MIC Test Strip (all isolates). Agreement between the methods was analyzed and MICs (ours and published data) were categorized by using recently proposed ECVs. Fluconazole MICs were >256 mg/L, while >60% of voriconazole MICs were >1 mg/L by the three methods. Posaconazole was the most active azole (EUCAST GM MIC 0.053 mg/L), followed by isavuconazole (GM MIC 0.066 mg/L) and itraconazole (GM MIC 0.157 mg/L). Echinocandins MICs were \u22640.5 mg/L by SYO and EUCAST. The overall, lowest amphotericin-B MICs (\u2264 0.25 mg/L) were obtained by EUCAST. The essential agreement (\u00b12 dilutions) between EUCAST and SYO was >93% for the eight antifungal agents. For this new C. auris clade all isolates were fluconazole resistant, and for anidulafungin, micafungin, and amphotericin-B MICs were \u22641 mg/L using dilution methods. Voriconazole MICs were method-dependent. The number of non-wild type (non-WT) isolates depends on the ECV applied; by the 97.5% ECV all isolates were WT except for isavuconazole (1.8% non-WT). Good essential agreement (>93%) was observed between EUCAST and SYO."}

{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "CONTEXT:Fluconazole (FNZ) is a drug used in antifungal therapy. However, the minimum FNZ dose to interfering with immune responses or inducing DNA damage is still unknown. OBJECTIVE:This study investigated the toxicological profile of FNZ on cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with different concentrations of this azole. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Cultured PBMCs were exposed to FNZ (6, 12, 30, 60 and 120\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and the toxicological profile was assessed by the following parameters: cytotoxic and nuclear division index (necrotic, apoptotic and viable cells), DNA damage (alkaline comet test), mutagenic potential (micronucleus test), cytokine modulation (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), and predictive toxicity (Osiris\u00ae and LAZAR\u00ae programs). RESULTS:Our results demonstrated that FNZ induced cellular DNA damage and mutagenicity at concentrations above the plasma peak (>30\u2009\u03bcg/mL) and 6\u2009\u03bcg/mL, respectively, which was associated with increased TNF-\u03b1, and decrease IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations. These effects may be related to increased apoptosis and cytotoxic nuclear division index in the cultured PBMCs. In silico results indicated potential mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant, and carcinogenic effects, which were partially confirmed by the above assays. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS:Together, these findings suggest the need to rationalize the use of FNZ, especially if it is used for long periods or with concomitant pathologies requiring azole therapy that may increase FNZ's plasma concentration."}

METHODS:We studied 507 C.\u00a0tropicalis isolates causing invasive candidiasis from ten hospitals over 5\u00a0years. Antifungal susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution methods. Point mutations in the C.\u00a0tropicalis ERG11 gene that may confer azole resistance were explored and verified. The expression levels of ERG11, CYTb, MDR1 and CDR1 genes were compared in 20 fluconazole-susceptible and 20 fluconazole-resistant isolates. RESULTS:Fluconazole-susceptible, -susceptible dose-dependent and -resistant strains accounted for 76.7% (389/507), 10.5% (53/507) and 12.8% (65/507) of C.\u00a0tropicalis isolates, respectively. The ERG11 mutation A395T/W occurred in 10.7% (54/507) of isolates, all of which were resistant to fluconazole. The nucleotide mutation C461T/Y was the second most common (50/507 isolates, 9.9%), and all isolates carrying C461T/Y also had the mutation A395T/W. However, the presence of C461T did not contribute to the azole-resistant phenotype. Substitutions V125A, Y257H and G464S (<2% of isolates), which were reported for the first time in C.\u00a0tropicalis, also conferred fluconazole non-susceptible phenotypes. Compared with fluconazole susceptible isolates, fluconazole-resistant isolates had higher ERG11 (fold expression level 1.42 versus 0.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but lower CYTb (fold expression level 1.26 versus 2.67, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) gene expression levels. Three azole-resistant isolates carrying the wild-type ERG11 gene had higher levels of CDR1 and MDR1 expression. CONCLUSIONS:ERG11 missense mutations were the major mechanism responsible for azole resistance in C.\u00a0tropicalis isolates, but overexpression of ERG11, CDR1 and MDR1, as well as reduced expression of CYTb, also contributed to resistance."}

{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Biofilm formation is a relevant risk factor for mortality in candidemia. Data about serum-based susceptibility testing against Candida biofilms are scant; therefore, the activity of fluconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin and micafungin was determined against Candida albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms with or without 50% human serum using XTT-based assays. Serum caused a remarkable adverse effect regarding biofilm structure for both species. Additionally, the ratio of nonviable cells increased for C. parapsilosis biofilms, as confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry. Despite impaired biofilm development, traditionally biofilm-active antifungals, surprisingly, showed decreased activity against C. albicans biofilms in serum at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1\u00a0mg/l and from 0.015 to 1\u00a0mg/l for amphotericin B and echinocandins, respectively (P < .01-.05). However, C. parapsilosis showed higher susceptibility to these antifungals due to reduced biofilm mass and the fungicidal effect of serum at concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 1\u00a0mg/l and from 0.015 to 512\u00a0mg/l for amphotericin B and echinocandins, respectively (P < .01-.05). Fluconazole exerted better antifungal activity in serum than traditionally biofilm-active antifungals against both examined biofilms. For fluconazole, significant differences were observed in susceptibility between serum-treated and serum-free biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 8\u00a0mg/l and from 0.03 to 512\u00a0mg/l for C. albicans and C. parapsilosis isolates, respectively (P < .01-.05). The high antifungal activity of fluconazole in 50% serum both against C. albicans and C. parapsilosis biofilms supports the utility of fluconazole prophylaxis to reduce the risk of catheter-associated fungal infections."}

Although we had anecdotally observed a high proportion of patients reporting cutaneous adverse effects associated with fluconazole treatment, this observation was not well described in the medical literature, and we were unsure of the additional effect of the arid desert environment of Arizona. METHODS:We performed a one-time, voluntary survey of patients with coccidioidomycosis and compared the responses of patients treated with fluconazole with those of untreated patients. RESULTS:From January 1, 2015, to August 22, 2017, 62 fluconazole-treated and 35 untreated patients with coccidioidomycosis provided consent and were enrolled in the study; demographics were similar between the two groups. Among the 62 fluconazole-treated patients, daily dosages ranged from 200 mg to 800 mg. However, most (44/62, 71%) took 400 mg daily, the typical dose for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis. The median fluconazole treatment duration at the time of study participation was 6 months. When compared with untreated patients, those taking fluconazole had more moderate to severe dry lips (74.2% [46/62] vs. 23.5% [8/34]; P < 0.001), dry skin (45.8% [27/59] vs. 22.9% [8/35]; P = 0.03), and alopecia (31.1% [19/61] vs. 11.4% [4/35]; P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS:For the treatment of coccidioidomycosis, patients receiving fluconazole reported significantly more severe cutaneous effects, including dry lips, dry skin, and alopecia, than untreated patients. Our findings identify an association but do not prove causality."}

{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Invasive candidiasis is a common and serious infection in premature newborns. Preventing and treating fungal infections is very important to improve the prognosis of premature infants. Fluconazole and amphotericin B are used as the first choice in the treatment of invasive fungal infections of the newborns. In some cases, fluconazole and amphotericin B cannot be used due to nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity or resistant strains. Micafungin, which is among recently developed echinocandins, is the drug of choice in these cases. The use of micafungin in newborns is new and there is a limited experience about the effect of high dose usage in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the electronic files of patients who used micafungin for the treatment of culture-proven or possible invasive fungal infection during their hospital stay in the neonatal intensive care unit during a 24-month period (2016-2017) in the third-level intensive care unit. A total of 15 patients (10 premature and 5 term babies) were included in the study. The mean birth weight of the patients was 1732 \u00b1 999 g and the mean gestational age was 32.2 \u00b1 5.8 weeks. All patients had long-term intensive care and increased risk of invasive candidiasis infection. Central venous catheterization and multiple antibiotics usage were the most common risk factors in these patients. The other risk factors included intubation, total parenteral nutritional use and surgical procedure application. Candida species were isolated from the cultures of four patients. Candida species isolated from patients were Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida catenulata, Candida parapsilosis. The mean time for onset of micafungin was 29.9 \u00b1 16.6 days. Mean duration of micafungin therapy was 22.4 \u00b1 11.2 days. Eight patients received amphotericin B, three patients received fluconazole therapy and four patients did not receive any antifungal therapy before the onset of micafungin. None of these patients had an abnormal kidney or liver function tests due to micafungin use. As a conclusion, high dose (10 mg/kg/day) micafungin is a safe and effective treatment choice both in the treatment of neonatal culture proven or probable invasive candida infections that were caused by refractory Candida strains, and in the case of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity."}

Over the past 20 years, 61 patient isolates of C auris (4 blood and 57 ear) have been obtained from 13 hospitals in Korea. Here, we reanalyzed those molecularly identified isolates using two matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) systems, including Biotyper and Vitek MS, followed by antifungal susceptibility testing, sequencing of the ERG11 gene, and genotyping. With a research-use-only (RUO) library, 83.6% and 93.4% of the isolates were correctly identified by Biotyper and Vitek MS, respectively. Using an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) library of Vitek MS, 96.7% of the isolates were correctly identified. Fluconazole-resistant isolates made up 62.3% of the isolates, while echinocanidin- or multidrug-resistant isolates were not found. Excellent essential (within two dilutions, 96.7%) and categorical agreements (93.4%) between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Vitek 2 (AST-YS07 card) methods were observed for fluconazole. Sequencing ERG11 for all 61 isolates revealed that only 3 fluconazole-resistant isolates showed Erg11p amino-acid substitution K143R. All 61 isolates showed identical multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses revealed that both blood and ear isolates had the same or similar patterns. These results show that MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek 2 antifungal susceptibility systems can be reliable diagnostic tools for testing C auris isolates from Korean hospitals. The Erg11p mutation was seldom found among Korean isolates of C auris, and multidrug resistance was not found. Both MLST and PFGE analyses suggest that these isolates are genetically similar."}
{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "The purpose of this review is to critically analyze published data evaluating the impact of azole pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, MICs, and Candida species on clinical outcomes in patients with candidemia. Clinical breakpoints (CBPs) for fluconazole and voriconazole, which are used to determine susceptibility, have been defined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) for Candida species. Studies evaluating the relationship between treatment efficacy and in vitro susceptibility, as well as the pharmacodynamic targets, have been conducted in patients treated with fluconazole for candidemia; however, for species other than Candida albicans and Candida glabrata, and for other forms of invasive candidiasis, data remain limited and randomized trials are not available. Limited data evaluating these relationships with voriconazole are available. While pharmacodynamic targets for posaconazole and isavuconazole have been proposed based upon studies conducted in murine models, CBPs have not been established by CLSI. Fluconazole remains an important antifungal agent for the treatment of candidemia, and data supporting its use based on in vitro susceptibility are growing, particularly for C. albicans and C. glabrata Further investigation is needed to establish the roles of voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole in the treatment of candidemia and for all agents in the treatment of other forms of invasive candidiasis."}

We evaluated the activity of rezafungin (RZF; previously CD101), an echinocandin with extended half-life, and comparators using CLSI broth microdilution methods against 719 invasive fungal isolates collected worldwide during 2017.MethodsSusceptibility tests were conducted on 616 Candida spp. (6 species), 25 C. neoformans (CNEO), 18 A. flavus (AFL), and 60 A. fumigatus (AFU) for RZF, anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and azoles. CLSI clinical breakpoint (CBP) and epidemiological cutoff value (ECV) interpretive criteria were applied.ResultsRZF inhibited 100.0% of C. albicans (CA) isolates, 96.3% of C. tropicalis (CT), 93.4% of C. glabrata (CG), 100.0% of C. krusei, and 100.0% of C. dubliniensis at \u22640.12 \u00b5g/mL. All but 2 (116/118 [98.3%]) C. parapsilosis (CP) isolates were inhibited by RZF at \u22642 \u00b5g/mL. Resistance to fluconazole was detected among 10.7% of CG, 10.2% of CP, 1.9% of CT, and 0.7% of CA. The activity of RZF against these 6 Candida spp. was similar to that of the other echinocandins, the vast majority of which were susceptible/wild type (WT) using CBP/ECV. Fluconazole and other triazoles displayed good activity against CNEO whereas echinocandins, including RZF, displayed limited activity against CNEO isolates (MIC90 >8 \u00b5g/mL). Echinocandins displayed good activity against ASF and AFL, and RZF activity was similar to that of anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin. All isolates displayed WT MIC values for the mold-active azoles.ConclusionRezafungin was as active as other echinocandins against common fungal organisms recovered from invasive fungal infections. The extended half-life and stability of rezafungin is very desirable for prevention and treatment, especially in patients who could be discharged on outpatient therapy.  Disclosures M. A.

{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Imrecoxib is one type of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor with the capability of reducing the potential cardiovascular risk caused by other NSAIDs. Co-administration with other medications can affect the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 enzyme function; thus, imrecoxib metabolism can be affected. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of fluconazole, which is known to inhibit CYP2C9, on imrecoxib's pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters.In this single-center, single-arm, open-label, self-controlled study, 12 healthy Chinese male volunteers (mean [SD] age, 22.6 [2.43] years) received the following 2 treatments separated by a washout period of 8 days under a fasting state: (1) a single oral dose of imrecoxib 100 mg; and (2) fluconazole 200 mg/d over 6 days followed by concurrent dosing of imrecoxib 100 mg and fluconazole 200 mg. Plasma concentrations of imrecoxib (M0) and its metabolites (4'-hydroxymethyl metabolite [M1] and 4'-carboxylic acid metabolite [M2]) for PK analysis were obtained at 0 (baseline) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after imrecoxib dosing. Safety and tolerability assessments were performed throughout the study.All subjects completed the study. There was 1 adverse event; drug-induced liver damage in 1 subject occurred after he received imrecoxib plus fluconazole, and the subject recovered without any sequelae. Coadministration with fluconazole resulted in much higher plasma imrecoxib concentrations, with an increase of 88% in Cmax and 72% in AUC0-t compared with only imrecoxib treatment, which showed that fluconazole may increase plasma exposure to imrecoxib. Fluconazole also caused a small, but not clinically relevant, decrease in M1 and M2 mean Cmax (13% and 14%, respectively), but there was minimal change in M1 and M2 mean AUC0-t (3% and 2%). However, there were no statistically significant differences in vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, ECGs, or adverse events between treatments.Concurrent administration of imrecoxib and fluconazole did not seem to change imrecoxib's safety profile. The ratio (imrecoxib\u202f+\u202ffluconazole/imrecoxib) for AUC0-t was 1.72 (90% CI, 1.41-2.11) and for Cmax it was 1.88 (90% CI, 1.59-2.21). Hence, it is necessary to adjust the imrecoxib dose when it is concurrently used with other CYP2C9 inhibitors."}

Materials and methods:Species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) supplemented by rDNA sequencing, and fluconazole and voriconazole susceptibilities of yeasts were determined by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk diffusion methods. Results:Overall, 884 noncandidal isolates belonging to 38 species were collected. Cryptococcus neoformans was the most common (75.6%), which also comprised 96.5% of the isolates from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 62.6% from blood, followed by Trichosporon asahii (6.9%) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (5.1%). Fluconazole susceptibility and resistant rates were 74.1% and 9.7% for C. neoformans and 81.0% and 5.2% for T. asahii. Voriconazole exhibited good activity in comparison to these two species (99.5% and 98.3% of the isolates, were susceptible). However, 100% of the R. mucilaginosa isolates were resistant to both azoles. Other noncandidal yeast species showed reduced susceptibility to fluconazole (53.3%) but most were susceptible to voriconazole (94.3%). Over the 5 years, a decrease in the proportion of fluconazole-susceptible isolates was observed for C. neoformans (90%-67%, P<0.001) and other noncandidal yeast species (91%-66%, P<0.001). Moreover, the prevalence of azole-resistant R. mucilaginosa increased from 1% to 7% (P<0.001). Conclusion:The shift in azole susceptibilities in mainland China calls for continued surveillance for noncandidal yeasts."}
{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Candidiasis is a major challenge among renal transplant recipients (RTRs) worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Fluconazole is the most commonly used agent for Candida infections. However, frequent relapse and treatment failure are still reported among patients affected with this infection. In the present study, Candida species obtained from RTRs were characterized based on conventional and molecular assays. Furthermore, the antifungal susceptibility profiles of these species were determined. This study was conducted on a total of 126 RTRs within 2012-2016. The patients were categorized according to the referenced diagnostic criteria. The identification of Candida species was accomplished based on conventional examination, assimilation profile test, and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and caspofungin were determined based on the guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The patients with Candida infection were diagnosed with urinary tract candidiasis (n\u202f=\u202f17), peritonitis (n\u202f=\u202f8), intra-abdominal candidiasis (n\u202f=\u202f6), candidemia (n\u202f=\u202f4), hepatosplenic candidiasis (n\u202f=\u202f3), and Candida pneumonia (n\u202f=\u202f3).

Fluconazole-resistance was observed in seven isolates, entailing C. albicans (n\u202f=\u202f6) and C. tropicalis (n\u202f=\u202f1). Fluconazole MIC for C. lusitaniae isolates was above the epidemiologic cut-off value (4-16\u202f\u03bcg/ml). Furthermore, MIC range values of fluconazole against C. famata and C. kefyr were obtained as 4-32\u202f\u03bcg/ml and 4-8\u202f\u03bcg/ml, respectively. Posaconazole exhibited potent activity against Candida isolates, followed by caspofungin. The identification of Candida species, together with susceptibility testing, provides important data about the geographic trends of the fluconazole-resistance profiles of Candida species.

RESULTS:Nineteen patients were recruited. A two-compartment model with first-order intravenous input and first-order elimination was developed. Patient's age and time elapsed from LTx were the covariates included in the final model. At an MIC of 2\u00a0mg/L, a LD of 600\u00a0mg was required for optimal PTAs between days 1 and 20 from LTx, while 400\u00a0mg was sufficient from days 21 on. A MD of 200\u00a0mg was required for patients aged 40-49\u00a0years old, while a dose of 100\u00a0mg was sufficient for patients aged \u2265\u200950\u00a0years. CONCLUSIONS:Fluconazole dosages of 100-200\u00a0mg daily may ensure optimal PTA against C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis. Higher dosages are required against C. glabrata. Estimated creatinine clearance is not a reliable predictor of fluconazole clearance in LT patients."}

Specifically, antifungal therapy in three main areas is updated as follows: a) Prophylaxis of premature neonates against invasive candidiasis; b) management of candidemia and meningoencephalitis in neonates; and c) prophylaxis, empiric therapy, and targeted antifungal therapy in children with primary or secondary immunodeficiencies. Fluconazole remains the most frequent antifungal prophylactic agent given to high-risk neonates and children. However, the emergence of fluconazole resistance, particularly in non-albicans Candida species, should be considered during preventive or empiric therapy. In very-low birth-weight neonates, although fluconazole is used as antifungal prophylaxis in neonatal intensive care units (NICU's) with relatively high incidence of invasive candidiasis (IC), its role is under continuous debate. Amphotericin B, primarily in its liposomal formulation, remains the mainstay of therapy for treating neonatal and pediatric yeast and mold infections. Voriconazole is indicated for mold infections except for mucormycosis in children >2 years. Newer triazoles-such as posaconazole and isavuconazole-as well as echinocandins, are either licensed or under study for first-line or salvage therapy, whereas combination therapy is kept for refractory cases."}
{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Introduction:Ketoconazole has long been the first-line medical therapy for controlling hypercortisolism secondary to either pituitary or adrenal pathology. However, it is largely unavailable in most countries. As a result, we have turned to fluconazole as a viable alternative in view of its favourable safety profile. Case Presentation:A 50-year-old lady developed recurrent Cushing's disease after being in remission following transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) for a left pituitary microadenoma 16 years ago. The repeat MRI showed a right pituitary microadenoma (1.7 mm \u00d7 1.3 mm) for which she underwent a second TSS. However, she continued to have persistent hypercortisolism despite repeated MRIs showing absence of tumour recurrence. She refused bilateral adrenalectomy and external radiotherapy. Ketoconazole was commenced at 200 mg twice daily for disease control but this was hindered by intolerable side effects including pruritus and skin exfoliation. In the meantime, she suffered a right hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage. Treatment was subsequently switched to cabergoline and the dose titrated to 0.5 mg daily. Fluconazole 400 mg daily was later added to control the persistent disease. Her clinical and biochemical parameters improved markedly three months after the addition of fluconazole. No adverse event was reported. Her disease has remained stable for the last 15 months up until the time of the recent clinic review. Conclusions:This case demonstrates the long-term efficacy of fluconazole in tandem with cabergoline for the control of recurrent Cushing's disease."}

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends screening HIV-positive people with low CD4 counts for cryptococcal antigenaemia (CrAg), and treating those who are CrAg-positive. This Cochrane Review examined the effects of an approach where those with low CD4 counts received regular prophylactic antifungals, such as fluconazole. OBJECTIVES:To assess the efficacy and safety of antifungal drugs for the primary prevention of cryptococcal disease in adults and children who are HIV-positive. SEARCH METHODS:We searched the CENTRAL, MEDLINE PubMed, Embase OVID, CINAHL EBSCOHost, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, conference proceedings for the International AIDS Society (IAS) and Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), and reference lists of relevant articles up to 31 August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA:Randomized controlled trials of adults and children, who are HIV-positive with low CD4 counts, without a current or prior diagnosis of cryptococcal disease that compared any antifungal drug taken as primary prophylaxis to placebo or standard care. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted and analysed data. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We summarized all outcomes using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled data in meta-analyses. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS:Nine trials, enrolling 5426 participants, met the inclusion criteria of this review. Six trials administered fluconazole, while three trials administered itraconazole.Antifungal prophylaxis may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 6 trials, 3220 participants; low-certainty evidence). For cryptococcal specific outcomes, prophylaxis probably reduces the risk of developing cryptococcal disease (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.49; 7 trials, 5000 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably reduces deaths due to cryptococcal disease (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.72; 5 trials, 3813 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Fluconazole prophylaxis may make no clear difference to the risk of developing clinically resistant Candida disease (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.56; 3 trials, 1198 participants; low-certainty evidence); however, there may be an increased detection of fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates from surveillance cultures (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.55; 3 trials, 539 participants; low-certainty evidence). Antifungal prophylaxis was generally well-tolerated with probably no clear difference in the risk of discontinuation of antifungal prophylaxis compared with placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.13; 4 trials, 2317 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Antifungal prophylaxis may also make no difference to the risk of having any adverse event (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30; 4 trials, 2317 participants; low-certainty evidence), or a serious adverse event (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.41; 4 trials, 888 participants; low-certainty evidence) when compared to placebo or standard care. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:Antifungal prophylaxis reduced the risk of developing and dying from cryptococcal disease. Therefore, where CrAG screening is not available, antifungal prophylaxis may be used in patients with low CD4 counts at diagnosis and who are at risk of developing cryptococcal disease."}

Fluconazole, itraconazole and micafungin can be used to prevent fungal infections in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but fluconazole is not effective against Aspergillus, and itraconazole has less tolerability from gastrointestinal toxicity. Micafungin is approved for prophylaxis at a dose of 50 mg/day, less than a therapeutic dose. Voriconazole, the current preferred agent for invasive Aspergillus infection, is available in both oral and intravenous preparations, and has recently been approved for prophylaxis in Japan.

Hence, this prospective study of voriconazole as prophylaxis against invasive fungal infections in patients who have received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is being performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety, including incidence rate of proven/probable invasive aspergillosis and other fungal infections, and adverse event(s) due to voriconazole administration.

In heart transplant recipients, everolimus should be maintained at a target blood concentration of 3\u00a0-\u00a08\u00a0ng/mL, in combination with reduced-dose calcineurin inhibitors and therefore, requires strict monitoring. Fluconazole, an azole antifungal agent, affects blood concentration of tacrolimus by inhibiting the cytochromes P450 (CYP) 3A4 and 3A5. Therefore, to avoid overexposure during everolimus-azole cotreatment, the dose of everolimus should be reduced. However, the mechanism of interaction between everolimus and fluconazole remains unclear.We report the case of a heart transplant recipient who experienced a 2.8-fold increase in everolimus clearance and a 3.5-fold increase in everolimus dosage, following withdrawal of fluconazole therapy. The clearance and dosage of tacrolimus increased 4.7- and 3.0-fold, respectively.The concentrations of everolimus and tacrolimus should be carefully monitored when administered concomitantly with fluconazole to heart transplant recipients. The patient in this case had a CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype, and CYP3A5 constituted the metabolic pathway.

{"keyword": "Fluconazole", "texts": "Pathogenic basidiomycetous yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, causes fatal meningitis in immunocompromised individuals. Fluconazole (FLC) is a fungistatic drug commonly administered to treat cryptococcosis. Unfortunately, FLC-resistant strains characterized by various degree of chromosomal instability were isolated from clinical patients. Importantly, the underlying mechanisms that lead to chromosomal instability in FLC-treated C. neoformans remain elusive. Previous studies in fungal and mammalian cells link chromosomal instability to the reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study provides the evidence that exposure of C. neoformans to FLC induces accumulation of intracellular ROS, which correlates with plasma membrane damage. FLC caused transcription changes of oxidative stress related genes encoding superoxide dismutase (SOD1), catalase (CAT3), and thioredoxin reductase (TRR1). Strikingly, FLC contributed to an increase of the DNA damage in vitro, when complexed with iron or copper in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Strains with isogenic deletion of copper response protein metallothionein were more susceptible to FLC. Addition of ascorbic acid (AA), an anti-oxidant at 10 mM, reduced the inhibitory effects of FLC. Consistent with potential effects of FLC on DNA integrity and chromosomal segregation, FLC treatment led to elevated transcription of RAD54 and repression of cohesin-encoding gene SCC1. We propose that FLC forms complexes with metals and contributes to elevated ROS, which may lead to chromosomal instability in C. neoformans."}

When patients receive recommended therapy, mortality at 10 weeks has been reported to vary between 20 to 36%. However, mortality rate and factors affecting mortality after completing recommended therapy are not well known. We investigated mortality rate, and factors affecting mortality at 2 years among CCM patients following completion of recommended CCM therapy in Uganda. METHODS:A retrospective cohort study was conducted among HIV infected patients that had completed 10 weeks of recommended therapy for CCM (2 weeks of intravenous amphotericin B 1mg/kg and 10 weeks of oral Fluconazole 800mg daily) in the CryptoDex trial (ISRCTN59144167) between 2013 and 2015. Survival analysis applying Cox regression was used to determine the mortality rate and factors affecting mortality at 2 years. RESULTS:This study followed up 112 participants for 2 years. Mean age (\u00b1SD) was 34.9 \u00b1 8, 48 (57.1%) were female and 80 (74.8%) had been on ART for less than 1 year. At 2 years, overall mortality was 30.9% (20 deaths per 100 person-years). Majority of deaths (61.8%) occurred during the first 6 months. In multivariable analysis, mortality was associated with ever being re-admitted since discharge after hospital-based management of CCM (aHR = 13.33, 95% CI: 5.92-30.03), p<0.001; and self-perceived quality of life, with quality of life 50-75% having reduced risk compared to <50% (aHR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09-0.5), p<0.001, as well as >75% compared to <50% (HR = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.11-0.81), p = 0.018.

The MSH2 gene was sequenced, and isolates were genotyped using six microsatellite markers and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) based on six housekeeping genes. According to EUCAST, isolates causing candidemia (n = 90) were echinocandin susceptible, and four of them were fluconazole resistant (MIC \u226564\u2009mg/liter).

MSH2 gene mutations were present in 44.4% of the incident isolates, the most common being V239L. The presence of MSH2 mutations was not correlated with in vitro or in vivo antifungal resistance. Microsatellite and MLST revealed 27 genotypes and 17 sequence types, respectively. Fluconazole-resistant isolates were unrelated. Most MSH2 mutations were found in cluster isolates; conversely, some mutations were found in more than one genotype. No clinical differences, including previous antifungal use, were found between patients infected by wild-type MSH2 gene isolates and isolates with any point mutation.

One strain was found to be micafungin resistant due to a mutation in the FKS2 gene. Fluconazole resistance remained stable throughout the period and was observed in 20 (10.7%) of the isolates. An analysis of the antifungal consumption data revealed that recent prior exposure to fluconazole increased the risk to be infected by a resistant strain. In particular, the duration of the treatment was significantly longer for patients infected by a resistant isolate, while the total and mean daily doses received did not impact the acquisition of resistance in C. glabrata No link between genotype and resistance was found. However, multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analyses indicated a potential intrahospital spread of some isolates between patients. These isolates shared the same genetic profiles, and infected patients were hospitalized in the same unit during an overlapping period. Finally, quantitative real-time PCR analyses showed that, unlike that for other ABC efflux pumps, the expression of CgCDR1 was significantly greater in resistant strains, suggesting that it would be more involved in fluconazole (FLC) resistance.

With the growing mismatch between antimicrobial resistance and development, it is essential we understand the molecular mechanisms of resistance in order to prioritize and generate new effective antimicrobials. BcrR is a unique membrane-bound one-component system that regulates high-level bacitracin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis. In the presence of bacitracin, BcrR activates transcription of the bcrABD operon conferring resistance through a putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (BcrAB). BcrR has three putative functional domains, an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain, an intermediate oligomerization domain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. However, the molecular mechanisms of signal transduction remain unknown. Random mutagenesis of bcrR was performed to generate loss- and gain-of-function mutants using transcriptional reporters fused to the target promoter PbcrA. Fifteen unique mutants were isolated across all three proposed functional domains, comprising 14 loss-of-function and one gain-of-function mutant. The gain-of-function variant (G64D) mapped to the putative dimerization domain of BcrR, and functional analyses indicated that the G64D mutant constitutively expresses the PbcrA-luxABCDE reporter. DNA-binding and membrane insertion were not affected in the five mutants chosen for further characterization. Homology modelling revealed putative roles for two key residues (R11 and S33) in BcrR activation. Here we present a new model of BcrR activation and signal transduction, providing valuable insight into the functional characterization of membrane-bound one-component systems and how they can coordinate critical bacterial responses, such as antimicrobial resistance."}

{"keyword": "Bacitracin", "texts": "Bacitracin is a broad-spectrum polypeptide antibiotic, which is formed by 11 amino acids residues. Precursor amino acids supply might be the limit factor during bacitracin fermentation. First, our results demonstrated that increasing Ile and Leu supplies were regarded as the efficient strategies for the enhanced titer of bacitracin. Then, the amino acid permease YhdG, which was identified as the BCAA permease, was deleted and overexpressed in DW2, respectively. Our results showed that knocking out of permease YhdG could improve bacitracin production remarkablely. The bacitracin titer of the yhdG deficient strain DW2\u0394yhdG reached 917.35 U/mL by flask fermentation, increased by 11% compared with that of DW2. In addition, the bacitracin titer was decreased by 25% in the YhdG overexpressed strain. Meanwhile, the intracellular concentrations of BCAA were higher than DW2 during the biosynthesis of bacitracin. The above results suggested that the permease YhdG might act as an exporter for branched chain amino acids in B. licheniformis DW2. Taken together, the increasing intracellular concentrations of branched chain amino acids by deleting amino acid permease YhdG could improve bacitracin titer. This study provided a new strategy for high-level production of bacitracin."}

Our preliminary study showed that bacitracin might enhance the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (HBMSCs). The present study investigated whether bacitracin affects the osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs and the molecular mechanisms involved. The proliferation of HBMSCs in the presence of bacitracin was examined using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The effects of bacitracin on the cell cycle and apoptosis of HBMSCs were observed using flow cytometry assay. Staining and quantitative assays for alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, collagen deposition (Sirius Red), and mineralization (Alizarin Red) were used to study osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs. The expression of osteogenic differentiation markers was detected using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses. The activation of related signaling pathways was examined using a luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. Bacitracin treatment increased osteogenic differentiation of HBMSCs without cytotoxicity and did not adversely affect cell cycle progression or apoptosis. The luciferase reporter assay showed that bacitracin activated the transcription of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2) gene, a key gene in the BMP2/Smad signaling axis. Western blotting indicated that this axis was markedly activated by bacitracin stimulation of osteogenesis. Moreover, the activation of Smad phosphorylation and osteogenic differentiation by bacitracin was inhibited by a transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2/Smad inhibitor (LDN-193189 HCl) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) gene silencing (si-BMP2). In conclusion, our results suggest that bacitracin can promote osteogenesis of HBMSCs by activating the BMP2/Smad signaling axis."}

Global concern about the recurrent emergence and spreading of antimicrobial resistance is challenging the livestock producers to search for alternatives to feed added antibiotics. The use of phytogenic compounds appears as a feasible option due to their ability to emulate the bioactive properties of antibiotics. However, detailed description about the effects of in-feed antibiotics and alternative natural products on chicken intestinal microbiota is lacking. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was used to study composition of cecal microbiota in broiler chickens supplemented with either bacitracin or a blend of chestnut and quebracho tannins over a 30-day grow-out period. Both tannins and bacitracin had a significant impact on diversity of cecal microbiota. Bacitracin consistently decreased Bifidobacterium while other bacterial groups were affected only at certain times. Tannins-fed chickens showed a drastic decrease in genus Bacteroides while certain members of order Clostridiales mainly belonging to the families Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae were increased. Different members of these groups have been associated with an improvement of intestinal health and feed efficiency in poultry, suggesting that these bacteria could be associated with productive performance of birds."}

In dental biofilms, S. mutans often faces life-threatening insults, such as killing by antimicrobial compounds from competing species and from the host. How such insults affect the physiology and virulence of S. mutans is poorly understood. In this study, we explored this question by investigating the responses of S. mutans strains to several host defence peptides and bacitracin.S. mutans UA159 and its isogenic mutants, Sm\u0394bceA, Sm\u0394bceB, Sm\u0394bceR and Sm\u0394bceS, were examined for their antibiotic susceptibility and biofilm formation. The lux reporter strains were constructed to assay the responses of S. mutans to host defence peptides. In addition, the competitive fitness of these mutants against the parent in response to peptide antibiotics was determined in dual-strain mixed cultures.S. mutans UA159 (WT) was generally insensitive to physiological concentrations of \u03b1-defensin-1, \u03b2-defensin-3, LL-37 and histatin-5, but all of the BceABRS mutants were sensitive to these peptide antibiotics. The response of S. mutans to these peptide antibiotics involved the transcriptional activation of the bceABRS operon itself. Bacitracin or \u03b2-defensin-3 at a sub-inhibitory concentration induced biofilm formation in the parent, but not in any of the BceABRS mutants. None of the mutants were able to compete with the parent for persistence in duel-strain cultures in the presence of bacitracin or \u03b2-defensin-3.The BceABRS four-component system in S. mutans is involved in sensing, response and resistance to host defence peptides, and is required for the biofilm formation and fitness of S. mutans."}

The performance traits like feed intake, body weight gain and feed conversion ratio (FCR) and carcass traits like cut-up parts, giblet and abdominal fat yield remained unaffected due to dietary treatments for overall trial period; however, the average feed intake in early phase (0-3\u00a0weeks) reduced significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in treatment birds than both controls (T1 & T6). Serum protein concentration remained unchanged, whereas significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduction in serum lipids like triglyceride, LDL and total cholesterol concentration was noticed due to dietary inclusion of seeds. Serum enzymes like AST and ALT concentrations depleted significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) treated groups, except at higher seed doses (T5); however, alkaline phosphatase levels were unaffected. Coliform count in caecum and jejunum reduced linearly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) due to seed inclusion, whereas dose-dependent proliferation of lactobacilli was evident (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in caecum and jejunum of treated birds. No effect was observed on the villus height and crypt depth of the jejunal mucosa. To conclude, dietary supplementation of hemp and dill seed could not affect the growth performance and carcass traits; however, it positively altered the serum lipid profile of the birds and improved gut health as well, thereby enhanced overall performance of broiler chickens."}

We aimed to compare and rank treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with C difficile in adults.We did a random effects network meta-analysis within a frequentist setting to obtain direct and indirect comparisons of trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for published and unpublished trials from the creation of these databases until June 30, 2017. We included randomised controlled trials of treatments for non-multiply recurrent infections with confirmed C difficile in adults (at least 18 years) that reported both primary cure and recurrence rates, and we used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to appraise trial methods. For our analysis, we extracted the total numbers of patients with primary cure and recurrence from published and unpublished reports. The primary outcome was sustained symptomatic cure, defined as the number of patients with resolution of diarrhoea minus the number with recurrence or death.Of 23\u2008004 studies screened, 24 trials, which comprised 5361 patients and 13 different treatments, were included in the analysis. The overall quality of evidence was rated as moderate to low. For sustained symptomatic cure, fidaxomicin (odds ratio 0\u00b767, 95% CI 0\u00b755-0\u00b782) and teicoplanin (0\u00b737, 0\u00b714-0\u00b794) were significantly better than vancomycin.

{"keyword": "Bacitracin", "texts": "Antibiotic-mediated changes to the intestinal microbiome have largely been assumed to be the basis of antibiotic-induced neurophysiological and behavioral changes. However, relatively little research has addressed whether antibiotics act directly on the host nervous system to produce these changes. We aimed to identify whether acute exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to antibiotics directly modulates neuronally dependent motility reflexes, ex vivo. Motility of colon and jejunum segments in a perfusion organ bath was recorded by video and alterations to neuronally dependent propagating contractile clusters (PCC), measured using spatiotemporal maps of diameter changes. Short latency (<10 min) changes to PCC serve as an index of putative effects on the host nervous system. Bacitracin, penicillin V, and neomycin, all produced dose-dependent alterations to the velocity, frequency, and amplitude of PCC. Most significantly, colonic PCC velocity increased by 53% [probability of superiority (PS) = 87%] with 1.42 mg/ml bacitracin, 19% (PS = 81%) with 0.91 mg/ml neomycin, and 19% (PS = 86%) with 3.88 mg/ml penicillin V. Colonic frequency increased by 16% (PS = 73%) with 1.42 mg/ml bacitracin, 21% (PS = 79%) with 0.91 mg/ml neomycin, and 34% (PS = 85%) at 3.88 mg/ml penicillin V. Conversely, colonic amplitude decreased by 41% (PS = 79%) with 1.42 mg/ml bacitracin, 30% (PS = 80%) with 0.27 mg/ml neomycin and 25% (PS = 79%) at 3.88 mg/ml penicillin V. In the jejunum, antibiotic-specific changes were identified. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that acute exposure of the gastrointestinal lumen to antibiotics modulates neuronal reflexes. Future work should acknowledge the importance of this mechanism in mediating antibiotic-driven changes on gut-brain signaling."}

STUDY DESIGN:TiO2 nanoparticles enriched GIC was prepared by adding 3% TiO2 nanoparticles (w/w) into the powder component of conventional GIC. CPC containing GIC was developed by incorporating 1% CPC (w/w) into conventional GIC powder. Samples were segregated into three groups: GIC with 3% TiO2 nanoparticles, GIC with 1% CPC and unmodified conventional GIC. Compressive strength was assessed using the universal testing machine on cylindrical specimens made from each material. Antibacterial activity was assessed by measuring inhibition zones on Mitis Salivarius Bacitracin (MSB) agar inoculated with pure strain of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). RESULTS:GIC containing TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited significantly greater compressive strength as compared with CPC and conventional GIC groups (P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between the compressive strengths of CPC and conventional GIC group (P >0.05). Antibacterial activity was significantly greater for TiO2 group than conventional GIC (P <0.05). CPC increased the antibacterial activity of conventional GIC, though not significantly. CONCLUSION:The addition of 3% TiO2 nanoparticles improves the compressive strength of GIC as well as its antibacterial activity against S. mutans."}

Appropriate preoperative intravenous antibiotics were administered for all patients. Bacitracin topical antibiotic ointment was routinely applied to the sternal surgical incision after skin closure for all patients during this period. The incidence of sternal wound infection was assessed.During this 9-year experience, no episodes of deep sternal wound infections were observed, compared with a predicted rate of 0.29% (interquartile range: 0.19% to 0.46%) based on The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database risk calculator. Four episodes of superficial sternal wound infections were noted; gram-positive organisms were cultured in the majority of these cases. Bacitracin ointment was well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse effects reported.This study suggests that the routine application of topical bacitracin over the surgical skin incision is safe after cardiac surgery. Deep sternal wound infections were notably absent during this period.

BACKGROUND:Local antibiotic usage for CIED infection prophylaxis, in particular pocket irrigation, is a well-known strategy but with little data on its clinical effectiveness. METHODS:An anonymous voluntary online\u00a0survey was sent to a total of 2,092 arrhythmia-oriented cardiologists in 51 countries (1,490 from the United States). RESULTS:There were 487 responses (response rate 23.3%: U.S. 28.2%, outside of the U.S. 11.1%). Eighty-seven percent of respondents use intraoperative antimicrobial agent pocket irrigation and/or an antimicrobial eluting pouch to reduce CIED infection. Fifty-four percent of respondents believe that it is effective to use an antimicrobial agent pocket irrigation to reduce CIED infection; 33% of respondents are uncertain; a few consider this strategy ineffective (13%) or offered no opinion. Significant differences exist in the practice patterns and beliefs between the U.S. and non-U.S. countries (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Ninety-eight percent of respondents report using the same pocket irrigation protocol for permanent pacemaker versus implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Bacitracin (48%), vancomycin (39%), and a cephalosporin (29%) are the most commonly chosen antibiotics. A majority of the respondents are unaware of the cost of using antimicrobial agent pocket irrigation (69%) and neither are they concerned (67%). CONCLUSION:This international survey suggests that, while there are little clinical data to support or discourage such practice, the usage of antimicrobial agent pocket irrigation for CIED infection prophylaxis is widely used in current practice."}
{"keyword": "Bacitracin", "texts": "Bacitracin was discovered and named after a 7 year old American girl, Margaret Tracey in 1943 as Bacillus was isolated from her wounds. Bacillus licheniformis is usually present in soil and bird feathers. This bacterium is most commonly present around back plumage and chest of birds. There are different types of bacitracin but the one most potent is Bacitracin A. Bacitracin induced proteins are localized in bacterial membrane. Production of antibiotic initially stopped, resumed by induction of bacitracin induced protein but after few mitotic divisions microbes reverted to their vulnerable state. Induction of protein ceases after 4th hour of stationary phase. Immobilization is necessary for economic, process convenience and stability of the cell. Moreover, immobilization increases the ability of the cell to produce product in high quantity.Maximum production of antibiotic was noted at pH 8 after 4 hours of incubation at various glucose concentrations in shake flask fermentation at 30\u00b0C when immobilized in polyacrylamide gel. Increase in antibiotic activity was also found with increase in use of cells. Efforts have been made to alter heterocyclic metal binding subunit of bacitracin by synthesizing heterocyclic building blocks that can be coupled to linear decapeptide and consequently cyclization by PCPTE biodomain of bacitracin. Derivatives of bacitracin showed antimicrobial activities indicating the possibility of overcoming existing limitations just by altering their heterocyclic subunit. Bioactivity and stability can be increased by modifying peptide backbone of compounds."}

The drinking water samples were collected at the point of use in 25 cities in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, South Africa, Singapore and the USA. In total, 181 ARG subtypes belonging to 16 ARG types were detected with an abundance range of 2.8\u2009\u00d7\u200910-2 to 4.2\u2009\u00d7\u200910-1 copies of ARG per cell.

A rat osteomyelitis model with femoral medullary cavity placement of Ti rods was employed to analyze the prophylactic effect of bacitracin-modified Ti (Ti-BC). Thirty-six female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish the Ti implant-associated infection. The Ti and Ti-BC rods were incubated with and without Staphylococcus aureus to mimic the contaminated Ti rod and were implanted into the medullary cavity of the left femur, and sterile Ti rods were used as the blank control. After 3 weeks, the bone pathology was evaluated using X-ray and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) analysis.

Ti rods were implanted into the left femoral cavity and micro-CT and histological evaluation was conducted after 12 weeks. The in vivo study indicated that Ti-immobilized bacitracin owned the prophylaxis potential for the infection associated with the Ti implants and allowed for the osseointegration. Thus, the multiple biofunctionalized Ti implants could be realized via immobilization of bacitracin, making them promising candidates for preventing the Ti implant-associated infections while retaining the osseointegration effects."}

The aims of this study are to investigate the anti-migration effect of bacitracin, which is an inhibitor of PDI, and the associated factor in this process.Materials and Methods:U87-MG glioma cells were treated with bacitracin in 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, and 5.0\u2009mM concentrations. Western blot with caspase-3 was applied to evaluate the cytotoxicity of bacitracin. Adhesion, morphology, migration assays, and organotypic brain-slice culture were performed to evaluate the effect of bacitracin to the tumor cell. Western blot, PCR, and gelatin zymography were performed to investigate the associated factors. Thirty glioma tissues were collected following immunohistochemistryand Western blot.Results:Bacitracin showed a cytotoxicity in 3rd (p<0.05) and 4th (p<0.001) days, in 5.0 Mm concentration. The cell adhesion significantly decreased and the cells became a round shape after treated with bacitracin. The migration ability, the expression of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) decreased in a bacitracin dose- and time-dependent manner. The U87-MG cells exhibited low-invasiveness in the 2.5\u2009mM, compared with the untreated in organotypic brain-slice culture. PDI was expressed in the tumor margin, and significantly increased with histological glioma grades (p<0.001).Conclusions:Bacitracin, as a functional inhibitor of PDI, decreased the phosphorylated FAK and the secreted MMP-2, which are the downstream of integrin and play a major role in cell migration and invasion, might become one of the feasible therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma."}

The generated model's predictions for both the native and zinc complex of bacitracin for both formation of the major degradation product (F) and loss of the active isoform (A) were consistent with longer-term measured values at 30\u00b0C/53%RH and 40\u00b0C/75%RH, validating this approach for accelerating the determination of long-term stability of a peptide."}

{"keyword": "Bacitracin", "texts": "Bacitracin is a mixture of nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) that is extensively used as an antibiotic in both human and veterinary medicine. Despite its widespread use over the past six decades, very few studies have addressed the environmental fate of bacitracin and zinc-bacitracin complexes. In this study, the photochemical transformation of bacitracin components (i.e., cyclic dodecapeptides) in the aquatic environment was investigated. A high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based approach enabled monitoring of the photochemical degradation kinetics of individual bacitracin components, investigation of the relative contribution of reactive oxygen species (e.g., singlet oxygen, (1)O2) in dissolved organic matter-sensitized photoreactions, and identification of oxidative modifications in bacitracin photoproducts. The results of this study support the hypothesis that indirect photochemical oxidation of the histidine (His) residue by (1)O2 is a major degradation pathway for bacitracin A, the most potent congener of the mixture. Furthermore, the photooxidation rate of bacitracin A with (1)O2 decreased upon bacitracin A coordination with Zn(2+), demonstrating that the photochemistry of metal-bound His is different from that of metal-free His. Overall, these results provide insight into the fate of bacitracin components in the aquatic environment and highlight the potential of utilizing this HRMS-based methodology to study transformations of other environmentally relevant NRPs."}

However, the effect of mosquitoes feeding on birds, independent of disease, has not been well studied. We studied Barn Owls ( Tyto alba) nesting in artificial nest boxes in sugarcane ( Saccharum officinarum) fields in Florida. To reduce mosquito effects on nestlings, we used an insecticide spray in half of the nest boxes. Mosquito suction traps were fixed to the outside of eight nest boxes (four treated and four untreated) to collect mosquitoes over a 24-h period (one trap night) once weekly, from incubation until all nestlings fledged. Collected mosquitoes were counted, sorted into blood-fed and un-fed females, and identified to species when possible. The dominant mosquito species captured were Culex nigripalpus, Mansonia dyari, and Mansonia titillans. The highest total number of mosquitoes and blood-fed mosquitoes captured in a suction trap in one trap night was 3,193 and 379, respectively. Overall, significantly fewer mosquitoes were captured from treated nest boxes compared to untreated boxes. Nestling age influenced the total number of mosquitoes captured, with the highest numbers associated with fledglings 22-42 d old. The highest numbers of blood-fed mosquitoes were captured when nestlings were 22-28 d old. Nestlings in insecticide-treated boxes had higher survival rates compared to those in untreated boxes during months with high mosquito numbers. Mosquitoes can impose energetic costs on nestlings by causing stress from irritation, dehydration, and the constant regeneration of blood cells. These costs, in addition to factors such as food shortage, temperature, and overall health of the nestling, can contribute to higher mortality rates during nesting periods with high mosquito numbers."}

Unlike the Asian Tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) present in Spain since 2004, there has been no record of Ae. japonicus in the country until now. RESULTS:Here, we report the first detection of Ae. japonicus in Spain, at its southernmost location in Europe. This finding was triggered by the citizen science platform Mosquito Alert. In June 2018, a citizen sent a report via the Mosquito Alert app from the municipality of Siero in the Asturias region (NW Spain) containing pictures of a female mosquito compatible with Ae. japonicus. Further information was requested from the participant, who subsequently provided several larvae and adults that could be classified as Ae. japonicus. In July, a field mission confirmed its presence at the original site and in several locations up to 9 km away, suggesting a long-time establishment. The strong media impact in Asturias derived from the discovery raised local participation in the Mosquito Alert project, resulting in further evidence from surrounding areas. CONCLUSIONS:Whilst in the laboratory Ae. japonicus is a competent vector for several mosquito-borne pathogens, to date only West Nile virus is a concern based on field evidence. Nonetheless, this virus has yet not been detected in Asturias so the vectorial risk is currently considered low. The opportunity and effectiveness of combining citizen-sourced data to traditional surveillance methods are discussed."}
{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "Context Talking about Poverty is not obvious without examples, I would like to understand the link between Parasitology, Poverty and Prevention (the three P). I explain the three P by saying that there is four level of knowledge in Parasitology and the fourth level is the integration with other disciplines including virology with preventive measures, nutrition aspects with denutrition leading by some parasites as Ascaris, economy involving patients income and Poverty. As a reminder, the first level in Parasitology is the knowledge of the parasitic cycle with an emphasis on the mode of contamination, the second level is that of the implementation of technical or diagnostic means to identify the parasite in the laboratory or the bench and the third level is that of treating infected cases diagnosed in the laboratory. Objective The objective of this work is to contribute to reach the first sustainable development goal i.e. no Poverty. Specifically, this manuscript aimed to evaluate poverty with the protective measures against the harmful effects of mosquitoes that contribute to the quality of care given to patients of the University Hospital of Kinshasa (UHK). Findings Residual mosquito capture, carried out in 31 randomly selected rooms per block and per level in hospital departments, presented the number of 1,144 female mosquitoes (845 Culex, 207 Anopheles and 62 Aedes). Overall considered, the Mean Mosquito Density (MMD) was 36.2 / mosquito per room (6.9 Anopheles / room, 29.1 Culex / room and 2.1 Aedes / room with an extreme between 0 and 144 mosquitoes / room. The lowest MMD (6.2 mosquitoes / room) was observed in Block II (clinical biology and microbiology laboratories, delivery and private hospitalization rooms) compared to other hospital blocks that had the highest MMD and statistically identical (ranging between 29.2 and 45.5 mosquitoes / room). Our observations give a good idea of Poverty inside this hospital and where to concentrate in the prevention of malaria transmission within the hospital. Regardless of the block considered, it was the ground floor with an MMD of 52.8 mosquitoes / room which were the most dangerous places compared with the first and second floors with MMD respectively 17.6 and 25.6 mosquitoes / room. Conclusion In conclusion, the insufficiency of the UHK anti-mosquito measures was obvious. These should be applied without delay to prevent the risk of infection transmission by mosquitoes, even within the hospital, of hepatitis B virus and strains of Plasmodium falciparum, sometimes highly virulent, which may be concentrated there. Limits We were on the right track and this study needs more research because of its limitations: we investigate and did not find if any of the mosquitoes collected were infected; we did not investigate if the hospital had any patients with a mosquito transmitted disease in the rooms where the mosquitoes were collected. Recommendation The recommendation is if it is not possible to eradicate parasitic diseases as malaria without eliminating poverty, then we need to eliminate them both.

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Different mosquito-borne pathogens are circulating in Iran including Sindbis virus, West Nile virus, filarioid worms and malaria parasites. However, the local transmission cycles of these pathogenic agents are poorly understood, especially because ecological data on vector species are scarce and there is limited knowledge about the host range; this understanding could help to direct species-specific vector control measurements or to prioritize research. METHODS:In the summers of 2015 and 2016, blood-fed mosquitoes were collected at 13 trapping sites on the coast of the Caspian Sea in northern Iran and at an additional trapping site in western Iran. Mosquitoes were generally collected with either a Biogents Sentinel trap or a Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey trap installed outside. A handheld aspirator was used at the trapping site in western Iran, in addition to a few samplings around the other trapping sites. On average, eight trapping periods were conducted per trapping site. The sources of blood meals were identified using a DNA barcoding approach targeting the cytochrome b or 16S rRNA gene fragment. RESULTS:The source of blood meals for 580 blood-fed mosquito specimens of 20 different taxa were determined, resulting in the identification of 13 different host species (9 mammals including humans, 3 birds and 1 reptile), whereby no mixed blood meals were detected. Five mosquito species represented more than 85.8% of all collected blood-fed specimens: Culex pipiens pipiens form pipiens (305 specimens, 55.7% of all mosquito specimens), Cx. theileri (60, 10.9%), Cx. sitiens (51, 9.3%), Cx. perexiguus (29, 5.3%) and Anopheles superpictus (25, 4.6%). The most commonly detected hosts of the four most abundant mosquito species were humans (Homo sapiens; 224 mosquito specimens, 40.9% of all mosquito specimens), cattle (Bos taurus; 171, 31.2%) and ducks (Anas spp.; 75, 13.7%). These four mosquito species had similar host-feeding patterns. The only exceptions were a relatively high proportion of birds for Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens (23.2% of detected blood meal sources) and a high proportion of non-human mammals for Cx. theileri (73.4%). Trapping month, surrounding area, or trapping method had no statistically significant impact on the observed host-feeding patterns of Cx. pipiens pipiens f. pipiens. CONCLUSIONS:Due to the diverse and overlapping host-feeding patterns, several mosquito species must be considered as potential enzootic and bridge vectors for diverse mosquito-borne pathogens in Iran. Most species can potentially transmit pathogens between mammals as well as between mammals and birds, which might be the result of a similar host selection or a high dependence on the host availability."}
{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "Mosquito-borne pathogens contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, infecting millions of people each year. Mosquito feeding is critical to the transmission dynamics of pathogens, and thus it is important to understanding and interpreting mosquito feeding patterns. In this paper we explore mosquito feeding patterns and their implications for disease ecology through a meta-analysis of published blood meal results collected across Australia from more than 12,000 blood meals from 22 species. To assess mosquito-vertebrate associations and identify mosquitoes on a spectrum of generalist or specialist feeders, we analysed blood meal data in two ways; first using a novel odds ratio analysis, and secondly by calculating Shannon diversity scores. We find that each mosquito species had a unique feeding association with different vertebrates, suggesting species-specific feeding patterns. Broadly, mosquito species could be grouped broadly into those that were primarily ornithophilic and those that fed more often on livestock. Aggregated feeding patterns observed across Australia were not explained by intrinsic variables such as mosquito genetics or larval habitats. We discuss the implications for disease transmission by vector mosquito species classified as generalist-feeders (such as Aedes vigilax and Culex annulirostris), or specialists (such as Aedes aegypti) in light of potential influences on mosquito host choice. Overall, we find that whilst existing blood meal studies in Australia are useful for investigating mosquito feeding patterns, standardisation of blood meal study methodologies and analyses, including the incorporation of vertebrate surveys, would improve predictions of the impact of vector-host interactions on disease ecology. Our analysis can also be used as a framework to explore mosquito-vertebrate associations, in which host availability data is unavailable, in other global systems."}

A better understanding of the temporal factors that modify transmission is needed. Here, we examined the effects of age at the time of infectious bloodmeal and the interaction with age-dependent life traits on the transmission potential of Zika virus (ZIKV) by Aedes aegypti. To do this, we applied three treatments: treatment Z, where mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV at 5 days post-emergence; treatment M.Z, where mosquitoes were given a non-infectious bloodmeal at 5 days post-emergence, followed by a ZIKV-infectious bloodmeal at 12 days post-emergence; and treatment S.Z, where mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV at 12 days post-emergence. We then observed the impact of these treatments on mosquito mortality, vector competence, and biting rate where we introduce a modification of the human landing rate to measure \"laboratory bloodmeal landing rate\" in the laboratory. Mosquitoes from treatment Z survived significantly longer than treatments M.Z and S.Z, though this difference was modest. There were no statistically significant differences observed in either vector competence or in biting rates among the three treatment groups when assessed as functions of days post exposure. When results were put in the context of mosquito age, we found a significant age effect in both vector competence and biting rate. Subsequently, we combined the life traits and viral kinetics results and modified the vectorial capacity equation in a way that addresses these age-dependent interactions, providing insight into the transmission potential of arboviruses as a function of mosquito age. Our principal finding is that mosquito age at the time of the infectious bite affects the subsequent transmission potential of the arbovirus, and offers a means by which to quantify this effect in our modified vectorial capacity equation."}

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SAMPLE 2,572 mosquitoes and 96 residents of 2 northern Florida communities. PROCEDURES A 32-item questionnaire was orally administered to a convenience sample of community residents to collect information on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding heartworms. Afterward, mosquito larvae were collected from the respondents' properties and adult mosquitoes were collected in both communities from surrounding wooded areas and residences of respondents. Mosquito species distribution and D immitis infection rates were determined. RESULTS Many residents (59% [57/96]) were unaware that mosquitoes transmit heartworms. Compared with non-dog owners, dog owners were significantly more likely to know about mosquito transmission, be concerned about heartworms, accurately estimate cost of treatment, and demonstrate willingness to pay for treatment. Most owners (71% [47/66]) administered heartworm preventives; those who did not cited lack of risk awareness, and cost was the least common reason. Of 28 mosquito species collected, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Culex erraticus, Culex nigripalpus, Coquillettidia perturbans, Culiseta inornata, Aedes albopictus, and Aedes aegypti were positive for D immitis infection. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings suggested that improved veterinary and public health messaging regarding the role of mosquitoes as vectors, higher cost of heartworm treatment versus prevention, and mosquito reduction and avoidance methods is needed."}

We performed bioinformatic analyses to identify putative protein-coding sequences that are specific to mosquito genomes. Systematic RNA interference (RNAi) screening of 40 mosquito-specific genes was performed by injecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. This experimental approach led to the identification of eggshell organizing factor 1 (EOF1, AAEL012336), which plays an essential role in the formation and melanization of the eggshell. Eggs deposited by EOF1-deficient mosquitoes have nonmelanized fragile eggshells, and all embryos are nonviable. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis identified that exochorionic eggshell structures are strongly affected in EOF1-deficient mosquitoes. EOF1 is a potential novel target, to our knowledge, for exploring the identification and development of mosquito-selective and biosafe small-molecule inhibitors."}

We tested the efficacy of two commercial-grade oviposition attractant formulations that were developed for the container-inhabiting Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes present in urban or semi-urban environments. These attractants can lure gravid females. Field trials were conducted in residential yards during a post-rainy season in September and October. Our data showed considerable efficacy for both attractants. Aedes-attractant collected 1.6-fold more larvae (101.2\u2009\u00b1\u200910.5 larvae/trap) than the control, and Culex-attractant collected 1.27-fold more larvae (151.2\u2009\u00b1\u200912.5 larvae/trap) than the control, resulting in 0.8 and 0.7 oviposition attraction indices (OAIs), respectively. Regression analysis indicated that the Aedes-attractant was more stable than the Culex-attractant. Location and time did not alter the efficacy of these attractants.

Different species of Anopheles mosquitoes have different epidemiological characteristics, behaviors, and ecological requirements, and so an understanding of their biology and ecology in a particular area is critical for successful disease control. The aim of this study was to determine which environmental factors are associated with Anopheles larvae in a malaria-endemic area in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand, which shares a border with Myanmar. In October 2016, we collected mosquito larvae and measured six environmental factors at 10 study sites located along Lam Pachi River, which flows through Huay Nam Nak village in Ratchaburi Province. We found two species of Anopheles larvae (An. subpictus sensu lato (s.l.) Grassi and An. barbirostris s.l. van der Wulp) at 7 of the 10 study sites, the numbers of which significantly differed between sites (p < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed that the numbers of larvae of both species were significantly positively correlated with the dissolved oxygen level (p < 0.01) and significantly negatively correlated with the width of the river (p < 0.05) and pH (p < 0.01). By contrast, turbidity, water depth, and water temperature were not associated with larval abundance. Mosquito species which belong to genus Anopheles are considered to be of public health and medical importance. Therefore, Anopheles mosquito surveillance and control in the study sites are essential. This information will facilitate vector-borne disease control and improve our understanding of the biology of Anopheles vectors in rivers located along international borders, further reducing the number of patients in this malaria-endemic area."}

Although we increasingly know more about the role of chemosensory behaviours in mediating mosquito-host interactions [1], the role of visual cues remains comparatively less studied [3], and how the combination of olfactory and visual information is integrated in the mosquito brain remains unknown. In the present study, we used a tethered-flight LED arena, which allowed for quantitative control over the stimuli, to show that CO2 exposure affects target-tracking responses, but not responses to large-field visual stimuli. In addition, we show that CO2 modulates behavioural responses to visual objects in a time-dependent manner. To gain insight into the neural basis of this olfactory and visual coupling, we conducted two-photon microscopy experiments in a new GCaMP6s-expressing mosquito line. Imaging revealed that the majority of ROIs in the lobula region of the optic lobe exhibited strong responses to small-field stimuli, but showed little response to a large-field stimulus. Approximately 20% of the neurons we imaged were modulated when an attractive odour preceded the visual stimulus; these same neurons also elicited a small response when the odour was presented alone. By contrast, imaging in the antennal lobe revealed no modulation when visual stimuli were presented before or after the olfactory stimulus. Together, our results are the first to reveal the dynamics of olfactory modulation in visually evoked behaviours of mosquitoes, and suggest that coupling between these sensory systems is asymmetrical and time-dependent."}

This virus is transmitted through the bite of Aedes aegypti, the main mosquito vector, and Ae. albopictus.

Mosquito saliva contains potent immunogens capable of inducing antibody production directly related to mosquito bite exposure intensity and disease risk. In this study, we first determined the DENV infection status by two different DENV non-structural protein 1 (NS1) based rapid tests and qRT-PCR, then measured the levels of IgG1 and IgG4 antibodies against salivary proteins of Ae. aegypti female mosquitoes in volunteers living in a dengue endemic area. Our results show that people with a positive DENV diagnosis present higher levels of IgG4 antibodies than people with a negative diagnostic test, and that these antibody levels were higher in people with secondary DENV infections. With this study, we show that detection of IgG4 antibodies against mosquito saliva may be a reliable method to evaluate the risk of dengue infection."}

Several artificial meal compositions were tested and Anopheles oogenesis, egg laying and development into the next generation of adult mosquitoes were followed. We identified blood-substitute-diets that supported ovarian development, egg maturation and fertility as well as, low progeny larval mortality, and normal development of offspring into adult mosquitoes. The formulated diet is an effective artificial meal, free of fresh blood that mimics a vertebrate blood meal and represents an important advance for the sustainability of Anopheles mosquito rearing in captivity."}

This is a major issue in building a predictive model for the mosquito trap counts over time across a particular region. The collective impact of all unobservable factors for one particular site is estimated by a hidden dimension method. Application to mosquito trap counts in Peel Region has shown that our model can significantly improve the modeling accuracy of the generalized linear model.

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Mosquito-borne viruses-such as Zika, chikungunya, dengue fever, and yellow fever, among others-are of global importance. Although vaccine development for prevention of mosquito-borne arbovirus infections has been a focus, mitigation strategies continue to rely on vector control. However, vector control has failed to prevent recent epidemics and arrest expanding geographic distribution of key arboviruses, such as dengue. As a consequence, there has been increasing necessity to further optimize current strategies within integrated approaches and advance development of alternative, innovative strategies for the control of mosquito-borne arboviruses. METHODS AND FINDINGS:This review, intended as a general overview, is one of a series being generated by the Worldwide Insecticide resistance Network (WIN). The alternative strategies discussed reflect those that are currently under evaluation for public health value by the World Health Organization (WHO) and represent strategies of focus by globally recognized public health stakeholders as potential insecticide resistance (IR)-mitigating strategies. Conditions where these alternative strategies could offer greatest public health value in consideration of mitigating IR will be dependent on the anticipated mechanism of action. Arguably, the most pressing need for endorsement of the strategies described here will be the epidemiological evidence of a public health impact. CONCLUSIONS:As the burden of mosquito-borne arboviruses, predominately those transmitted by Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus, continues to grow at a global scale, new vector-control tools and integrated strategies will be required to meet public health demands. Decisions regarding implementation of alternative strategies will depend on key ecoepidemiological parameters that each is intended to optimally impact toward driving down arbovirus transmission."}

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "BACKGROUND:The global strategy for elimination of lymphatic filariasis is by annual mass drug administration (MDA). Effective implementation of this strategy in endemic areas reduces Wuchereria bancrofti in the blood of infected individuals to very low levels. This minimises the rate at which vectors successfully pick microfilariae from infected blood, hence requiring large mosquito numbers to detect infections. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using trained community vector collectors (CVCs) to sample large mosquito numbers with minimal supervision at low cost for potential scale-up of this strategy. METHODS:CVCs and supervisors were trained in mosquito sampling methods, i.e. human landing collections, pyrethrum spray collections and window exit traps. Mosquito sampling was done over a 13-month period. Validation was conducted by a research team as quality control for mosquitoes sampled by CVCs. Data were analyzed for number of mosquitoes collected and cost incurred by the research team and CVCs during the validation phase of the study. RESULTS:A total of 31,064 and 8720 mosquitoes were sampled by CVCs and the research team, respectively. We found a significant difference (F(1,13) = 27.1606, P = 0.0001) in the total number of mosquitoes collected from southern and northern communities. Validation revealed similar numbers of mosquitoes sampled by CVCs and the research team, both in the wet (F(1,4) = 1.875, P = 0.309) and dry (F(1,4) = 2.276, P = 0.258) seasons in the southern communities, but was significantly different for both wet (F(1,4) = 0.022, P = 0.005) and dry (F(1,4 ) = 0.079, P = 0.033) seasons in the north. The cost of sampling mosquitoes per season was considerably lower by CVCs compared to the research team (15.170 vs 53.739 USD). CONCLUSIONS:This study revealed the feasibility of using CVCs to sample large numbers of mosquitoes with minimal supervision from a research team at considerably lower cost than a research team for lymphatic filariasis xenomonitoring. However, evaluation of the selection and motivation of CVCs, acceptability of CVCs strategy and its epidemiological relevance for lymphatic filariasis xenomonitoring programmes need to be assessed in greater detail."}

There is little evidence of resistance to plant allelochemicals; it is likely that their efficacy varies between genetically diverse populations, which may lead to the development of resistance in the future. This study evaluated the response of Anopheles gambiae (larvae and adults) from spatially different populations to acetone extracts of two botanicals, Piper guineense and Eugenia aromatica. Mosquito samples from 10 locations within Akure metropolis in Southwest Nigeria were tested for variation in susceptibility to the toxic effect of botanical extracts. The spatial distribution of the tolerance magnitude (T.M.) of the mosquito populations to the botanicals was also mapped. The populations of An. gambiae manifested significant differences in their level of tolerance to the botanicals. The centre of the metropolis was the hot spot of tolerance to the botanicals. There was a significant positive correlation between the adulticidal activities of both botanicals and initial knockdown. Hence, knockdown by these botanicals could be a predictor of their subsequent mortality. In revealing variation in response to botanical pesticides, our work has demonstrated that any future use of botanicals as alternative environmentally friendly vector control chemicals needs to be closely monitored to ensure that resistance does not develop."}

Available products for personal protection against mosquitoes lack adequate efficacy and in most cases need to be reapplied or replaced frequently. In recent years, the encapsulation of the active repellents in various matrices has arisen as an alternative method for the development of new-generation repellent systems. The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of functional micro/nanofibrous matrices as systems for the sustained release of the highly volatile insect-repellent citronella oil. RESULTS:Micro/nanofibrous single- and triple-layer systems incorporating citronella oil as the active agent were developed via the electrospinning technique using the low-cost, non-toxic, biodegradable polymers cellulose acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone. All the micro/nanofiber systems produced exhibited prolonged release of citronella oil and a high repellent activity in laboratory bioassays against the mosquito Aedes albopictus for at least 4 weeks. CONCLUSION:Considering the high volatility of the embedded repellent, the present study demonstrates the strong potential of the micro/nanofibrous matrices to act as carriers of highly volatile repellents for an effective and sustained protection from mosquitoes. \u00a9 2019 Society of Chemical Industry."}

Mosquitoes are ubiquitous insects, responsible for transmitting many deadly arboviruses causing millions of human deaths every year. The lack of efficient and flexible gene delivery strategies in mosquitoes are among the major hurdles for the study of mosquito biology and mosquito-pathogen interactions. We found that Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV), the type baculovirus species, can efficiently transduce mosquito cells without viral propagation, allowing high level gene expression upon inducement by suitable promoters without obvious negative effects on cell propagation and viability. AcMNPV transduces into several mosquito cell types, efficiently than in commonly used mammalian cell lines and classical plasmid DNA transfection approaches. We demonstrated the application of this system by expressing influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) into mosquito hosts. Moreover, AcMNPV can transduce both larvae and adults of essentially all blood-sucking mosquito genera, resulting in bright fluorescence in insect bodies with little or no tissue barriers. Our experiments establish baculovirus as a convenient and powerful gene delivery vector in vitro and in vivo that will greatly benefit research into mosquito gene regulation, development and the study of mosquito-borne viruses."}

Primary surveillance protocols and mosquito control interventions focus on indoor vectors of malaria, while many potential vectors feed and rest outdoors. Here we describe the application of novel tools that advance our understanding of diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection in the Anopheline mosquitoes of the Western Highland Fringe of Madagascar. Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed a novel outdoor trap, the QUadrant Enabled Screen Trap (QUEST), in conjunction with the recently developed multiplex BLOOdmeal Detection Assay for Regional Transmission (BLOODART). We captured a total of 1252 female Anopheles mosquitoes (10 species), all of which were subjected to BLOODART analysis. QUEST collection captured a heterogenous distribution of mosquito density, diversity, host choice, and Plasmodium infection. Concordance between Anopheles morphology and BLOODART species identifications ranged from 93-99%. Mosquito feeding behavior in this collection frequently exhibited multiple blood meal hosts (single host = 53.6%, two hosts = 42.1%, three hosts = 4.3%). The overall percentage of human positive bloodmeals increased between the December 2017 and the April 2018 timepoints (27% to 44%). Plasmodium positivity was found primarily in vectors considered to be of secondary importance, with an overall prevalence of 6%. Conclusions/Significance: The QUEST was an efficient tool for sampling Anopheline mosquitoes. Vectors considered to be of secondary importance were commonly found with Plasmodium DNA in their abdomens, indicating a need to account for these species in routine surveillance efforts. Mosquitoes exhibited multiple blood feeding behavior within a gonotrophic cycle, with predominantly non-human hosts in the bloodmeal. Taken together, this complex feeding behavior could enhance the role of multiple Anopheline species in malaria transmission, possibly tempered by zoophilic feeding tendencies."}

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Mosquito-borne arboviruses, like dengue virus, continue to cause significant global morbidity and mortality, particularly in Southeast Asia. When the infectious mosquitoes probe into human skin for a blood meal, they deposit saliva containing a myriad of pharmacologically active compounds, some of which alter the immune response and influence host receptivity to infection, and consequently, the establishment of the virus. Previous reports have highlighted the complexity of mosquito vector-derived factors and immunity in the success of infection. Cumulative evidence from animal models and limited data from humans have identified various vector-derived components, including salivary components, that are co-delivered with the pathogen and play an important role in the dissemination of infection. Much about the roles and effects of these vector-derived factors remain to be discovered. METHODS/DESIGN:We describe a longitudinal, pagoda (community)-based pediatric cohort study to evaluate the burden of dengue virus infection and document the immune responses to salivary proteins of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito vector of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. The study includes community-based seroprevalence assessments in the peri-urban town of Chbar Mon in Kampong Speu Province, Cambodia. The study aims to recruit 771 children between the ages of 2 and 9 years for a three year period of longitudinal follow-up, including twice per year (rainy and dry season) serosurveillance for dengue seroconversion and Ae. aegypti salivary gland homogenate antibody intensity determinations by ELISA assays. Diagnostic tests for acute dengue, Zika and chikungunya viral infections will be performed by RT-PCR. DISCUSSION:This study will serve as a foundation for further understanding of mosquito saliva immunity and its impact on Aedes-transmitted arboviral diseases endemic to Cambodia.

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "Background: Heterogeneity in malaria transmission has household, temporal, and spatial components. These factors are relevant for improving the efficiency of malaria control by targeting heterogeneity. To quantify variation, we analyzed mosquito counts from entomological surveillance conducted at three study sites in Uganda that varied in malaria transmission intensity. Mosquito biting or exposure is a risk factor for malaria transmission. Methods: Using a Bayesian zero-inflated negative binomial model, validated via a comprehensive simulation study, we quantified household differences in malaria vector density and examined its spatial distribution. We introduced a novel approach for identifying changes in vector abundance hotspots over time by computing the Getis-Ord statistic on ratios of household biting propensities for different scenarios. We also explored the association of household biting propensities with housing and environmental covariates. Results: In each site, there was evidence for hot and cold spots of vector abundance, and spatial patterns associated with urbanicity, elevation, or other environmental covariates. We found some differences in the hotspots in rainy vs. dry seasons or before vs. after the application of control interventions. Housing quality explained a portion of the variation among households in mosquito counts. Conclusion: This work provided an improved understanding of heterogeneity in malaria vector density at the three study sites in Uganda and offered a valuable opportunity for assessing whether interventions could be spatially targeted to be aimed at abundance hotspots which may increase malaria risk. Indoor residual spraying was shown to be a successful measure of vector control interventions in Tororo, Uganda.\u00a0 Cement walls, brick floors, closed eaves, screened airbricks, and tiled roofs were features of a house that had shown reduction of household biting propensity. Improvements in house quality should be recommended as a supplementary measure for malaria control reducing risk of infection."}
{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "Major efforts are currently underway to develop novel, complementary methods to combat mosquito-borne diseases. Mosquito genetic control strategies (GCSs) have become an increasingly important area of research on account of their species-specificity, track record in targeting agricultural insect pests, and their environmentally non-polluting nature. A number of programs targeting Aedes and Anopheles mosquitoes, vectors of human arboviruses and malaria respectively, are currently being developed or deployed in many parts of the world. Operationally implementing these technologies on a large scale however, beyond proof-of-concept pilot programs, is hampered by the absence of adequate sex separation methods. Sex separation eliminates females in the laboratory from male mosquitoes prior to release. Despite the need for sex separation for the control of mosquitoes, there have been limited efforts in recent years in developing systems that are fit-for-purpose. In this special issue of Parasites and Vectors we report on the progress of the global Coordinated Research Program on \"Exploring genetic, molecular, mechanical and behavioural methods for sex separation in mosquitoes\" that is led by the Insect Pest Control Subprogramme of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture with the specific aim of building efficient sex separation systems for mosquito species. In an effort to overcome current barriers we briefly highlight what we believe are the three main reasons why progress has been so slow in developing appropriate sex separation systems: the availability of methods that are not scalable, the difficulty of building the ideal genetic systems and, finally, the lack of research efforts in this area."}

Moreover, Culex pipiens is the most widespread mosquito vector in several regions of Iran and is the main vector for transmission of West Nile virus (WNV). Mosquitoes were collected at 14 sites in northern regions of Iran in 2015 and 2016. A subset of mosquito specimens was selected for identification confirmation using a DNA-barcoding technique. Construction of a phylogenetic tree showed clustering of mosquito sequences into three main genera: Aedes, Anopheles and Culex with individuals of a single species clustered closely together, regardless of where and when they were collected. Cx. pipiens complex and Cx. torrentium were identified and differentiated using multiplex real-time PCR targeting the gene locus for acetylcholinesterase 2 (ace2) to discriminate between Cx. pipiens pipiens and Cx. torrentium. The CQ11 microsatellite locus was used for discrimination between Cpp. biotypes. The predominant mosquito species in investigated regions were Cx. pipiens pipiens biotype pipiens, but we also detected Culex pipiens pipiens biotype molestus and hybrids of the two pipiens biotypes, as well as Cx. torrentium. The results of this study represent the first certain evidence of the presence of Cx. pipiens pipiens biotype molestus and hybrids between pipiens and molestus forms, and Cx. torrentium in Iran through a molecular identification approach.

A critical step in the implementation of MALDI-TOF MS identification is the creation of spectra databases (DB) for the species of interest. Mosquito legs were the body part most frequently used to create identification DB. However, legs are one of the most fragile mosquito compartments, which can put identification at risk. Here, we assessed whether mosquito thoraxes could also be used as a relevant body part for mosquito species identification using a MALDI-TOF MS biotyping strategy; we propose a double DB query strategy to reinforce identification success. METHODS:Thoraxes and legs from 91 mosquito specimens belonging to seven mosquito species collected in six localities from Guadeloupe, and two laboratory strains, Aedes aegypti BORA and Aedes albopictus Marseille, were dissected and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Molecular identification using cox1 gene sequencing was also conducted on representative specimens to confirm their identification. RESULTS:MS profiles obtained with both thoraxes and legs were highly compartment-specific, species-specific and species-reproducible, allowing high identification scores (log-score values, LSVs) when queried against the in-house MS reference spectra DB (thorax LSVs range: 2.260-2.783, leg LSVs range: 2.132-2.753). CONCLUSIONS:Both thoraxes and legs could be used for a double DB query in order to reinforce the success and accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS identification."}

The epidemic peaked in August to October 2016 and waned after April 2017. There was a preintervention period in October/November 2016 and IVM lasted until August 2017. The area under treatment (23.1 km2) had 61,511 inhabitants and 25,363 buildings. The city was divided into eight even clusters and treated following a cluster randomized stepped-wedge design. We analyzed pools of female Ae. aegypti adults for RNA detection of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses using 360 surveillance AGO traps every week. Rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity were monitored in each cluster. Mosquito density significantly changed (generalized linear mixed model; F8, 14,588 = 296; P < 0.001) from 8.0 \u00b1 0.1 females per trap per week before the intervention to 2.1 \u00b1 0.04 after the percentage of buildings treated with traps was 60% and to 1.4 \u00b1 0.04 when coverage was above 80%. Out of a total 12,081 mosquito pools, there were 1 DENV-, 7 CHIKV-, and 49 ZIKV-positive pools from October 2016 to March 2017. Afterward, we found only one positive pool of DENV in July 2017.

Although epidemics of arboviral emerging infectious diseases have risen in frequency in recent years, the extent to which mosquitoes maintain pathogens in circulation during inter-epidemic periods is still poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate whether arboviruses may be maintained by vertical transmission via immature life stages of different mosquito vector species. METHODOLOGY:We collected immature mosquitoes (egg, larva, pupa) on the shores and islands of Lake Baringo and Lake Victoria in western Kenya and reared them to adults. Mosquito pools (\u226425 specimens/pool) of each species were screened for mosquito-borne viruses by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of multiplex PCR products of genus-specific primers (alphaviruses, flaviviruses, phleboviruses and Bunyamwera-group orthobunyaviruses). We further confirmed positive samples by culturing in baby hamster kidney and Aedes mosquito cell lines and re-sequencing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Culex univittatus (2/31pools) and Anopheles gambiae (1/77 pools) from the Lake Victoria region were positive for Bunyamwera virus, a pathogenic virus that is of public health concern. In addition, Aedes aegypti (3/50), Aedes luteocephalus (3/13), Aedes spp. (2/15), and Culex pipiens (1/140) pools were positive for Aedes flaviviruses at Lake Victoria, whereas at Lake Baringo, three pools of An. gambiae mosquitoes were positive for Anopheles flavivirus. These insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFVs), which are presumably non-pathogenic to vertebrates, were found in known medically important arbovirus and malaria vectors. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that not only ISFVs, but also a pathogenic arbovirus, are naturally maintained within mosquito populations by vertical transmission, even in the absence of vertebrate hosts. Therefore, virus and vector surveillance, even during inter-epidemics, and the study of vector-arbovirus-ISFV interactions, may aid in identifying arbovirus transmission risks, with the potential to inform control strategies that lead to disease prevention."}

Mosquito control programs should implement resistance management strategies by assessing resistance in targeted populations, rotating different classes of insecticides based on resistance testing, and/or increasing insecticide concentration (i.e., saturation, using maximum labeled rate) to overcome emerging resistance. Resistance testing is often done solely on AIs, but should, in some cases, include both AIs and FPs at the concentrations mosquitoes may encounter in the field. The resistance/susceptibility status was determined for adulticides used in mosquito control. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle bioassays were used to assess resistance/susceptibility status for eight AIs (i.e., bifenthrin, permethrin, sumethrin/prallethrin, deltamethrin, tau-fluvalinate, chlorpyrifos, malathion, and naled) and eight FPs (TalStar, Biomist 3 + 15, Duet, Suspend Polyzone, Mavrik, MosquitoMist, Fyfanon, and Dibrom) that respectively contain the AIs.

Due to a combination of anthropogenic change, including the effects on global climate and wildlife migration there is strong evidence that temperate regions are undergoing repeated introduction of mosquito-borne viruses and the re-emergence of viruses that previously were not detected by surveillance. In Europe, the repeated introductions of West Nile and Usutu viruses have been associated with bird migration from Africa, whereas the autochthonous transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses has been driven by a combination of invasive mosquitoes and rapid transcontinental travel by infected humans. In addition to an increasing number of humans at risk, livestock and wildlife, are also at risk of infection and disease. This in turn can affect international trade and species diversity, respectively. Addressing these challenges requires a range of responses both at national and international level.

A questionnaire survey was used to measure social acceptability. RESULTS:Mosquito coils in a metal casing worn on a belt resulted in 92.3% (95% confidence interval, CI: 88.9-94.6%). landing protection from female mosquitoes in the afternoon and 68.8% (95% CI: 41.7-83.3%) protection in the evening compared to short untreated clothing.

Whilst long permethrin-treated overalls were protective (afternoon, 61.1%, 95% CI: 51.4-68.8%; evening, 43.0%, 95% CI: 25.5-56.4%), short permethrin-treated overalls and long untreated overalls were not.

These viruses affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, yet no clinically approved therapy is currently available for treating these viral infections. Thus, innovative therapies, especially inhibitors with broad antiviral activities against all these viruses, are urgently needed. While traditional therapeutic strategies mainly focus on inhibiting viral replication in a \"one lock, one key\" manner (e.g., viral protease and polymerase inhibitors), inhibitors targeting virions have recently emerged as a promising approach to achieve broad antiviral activities. Within this approach, Lipid Envelope Antiviral Disruption (LEAD) molecules were shown to broadly inhibit mosquito-borne viruses and other lipid membrane-enveloped viruses. Several LEAD molecules have been demonstrated to act against viral membranes in vitro, some of which have even shown in vivo efficacy to treat mosquito-borne viral infections. This therapeutic potential is further enhanced by molecular engineering to improve the inhibitors' pharmacological properties, laying the foundation for the LEAD antiviral strategy to be explored for possible treatment of mosquito-borne viral infections."}

A total of 12 rain pools were sampled biweekly over a 1-yr period in search of mosquito immature stages. Mosquito immature stages were present in all the occasions in which water bodies were recorded. A total of 14 species of five genera were identified, with the highest abundances observed in autumn and spring. The total abundance varied among dates according to previous temperature, precipitation, and flooding conditions. Only one species, Psorophora cyanescens (Coquillett) (Diptera: Culicidae), was associated with extreme conditions (high temperature and prolonged period of drought). Besides drought periods, two main variables were related to species composition: temperature, which accounted for seasonal changes in species composition, and flooding history, which accounted for the predominance of floodwater mosquito species on recently flooded dates and for that of stagnant water species on dates with a longer permanence of water. Regarding the pools, the most important variables accounting for species composition were the insolation level and the variability in the flooded area, with floodwater mosquitoes associated with pools with high variability in the flooded area. Interestingly, Culex (Mel.) pilosus (Dyar and Knab) (Diptera: Culicidae) showed temporal and spatial dynamics more similar to floodwater species than to stagnant water species in the rain pools studied."}

{"keyword": "Mosquito", "texts": "Malaria is mainly a tropical disease and its transmission cycle is heavily influenced by environment: The life-cycles of the Anopheles mosquito vector and Plasmodium parasite are both strongly affected by ambient temperature, while suitable aquatic habitat is necessary for immature mosquito development. Therefore, how global warming may affect malaria burden is an active question, and we develop a new ordinary differential equations-based malaria transmission model that explicitly considers the temperature-dependent Anopheles gonotrophic and Plasmodium sporogonic cycles. Mosquito dynamics are coupled to infection among a human population with symptomatic and asymptomatic disease carriers, as well as temporary immunity. We also explore the effect of incorporating diurnal temperature variations upon transmission. Rigorous analysis of the model show that the non-trivial disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is less than unity (this equilibrium is globally-asymptotically for a special case with no density-dependent larval and disease-induced host mortality). Numerical simulations of the model, for the case where the ambient temperature is held constant, suggest a nonlinear, hyperbolic relationship between the reproduction number and clinical malaria burden. Moreover, malaria burden peaks at 29.5 o C when daily ambient temperature is held constant, but this peak decreases with increasing daily temperature variation, to about 23-25 o C. Malaria burden also varies nonlinearly with temperature, such that small temperature changes influent disease mainly at marginal temperatures, suggesting that in areas where malaria is highly endemic, any response to global warming may be highly nonlinear and most typically minimal, while in areas of more marginal malaria potential (such as the East African highlands), increasing temperatures may translate nearly linearly into increased disease potential. Finally, we observe that while explicitly modelling the stages of the Plasmodium sporogonic cycle is essential, explicitly including the stages of the Anopheles gonotrophic cycle is of minimal importance."}

Data from a previous unrandomised phase 2 trial suggested that lomustine-temozolomide plus radiotherapy might be superior to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylation of the MGMT promoter. In the CeTeG/NOA-09 trial, we aimed to further investigate the effect of lomustine-temozolomide therapy in the setting of a randomised phase 3 trial. METHODS:In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients from 17 German university hospitals who were aged 18-70 years, with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter, and a Karnofsky Performance Score of 70% and higher. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a predefined SAS-generated randomisation list to standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (75 mg/m2 per day concomitant to radiotherapy [59-60 Gy] followed by six courses of temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 per day on the first 5 days of the 4-week course) or to up to six courses of lomustine (100 mg/m2 on day 1) plus temozolomide (100-200 mg/m2 per day on days 2-6 of the 6-week course) in addition to radiotherapy (59-60 Gy). Because of the different schedules, patients and physicians were not masked to treatment groups. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the modified intention-to-treat population, comprising all randomly assigned patients who started their allocated chemotherapy. The prespecified test for overall survival differences was a log-rank test stratified for centre and recursive partitioning analysis class. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01149109. FINDINGS:Between June 17, 2011, and April 8, 2014, 141 patients were randomly assigned to the treatment groups; 129 patients (63 in the temozolomide and 66 in the lomustine-temozolomide group) constituted the modified intention-to-treat population. Median overall survival was improved from 31\u00b74 months (95% CI 27\u00b77-47\u00b71) with temozolomide to 48\u00b71 months (32\u00b76 months-not assessable) with lomustine-temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b760, 95% CI 0\u00b735-1\u00b703; p=0\u00b70492 for log-rank analysis). A significant overall survival difference between groups was also found in a secondary analysis of the intention-to-treat population (n=141, HR 0\u00b760, 95% CI 0\u00b735-1\u00b703; p=0\u00b70432 for log-rank analysis). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were observed in 32 (51%) of 63 patients in the temozolomide group and 39 (59%) of 66 patients in the lomustine-temozolomide group. There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION:Our results suggest that lomustine-temozolomide chemotherapy might improve survival compared with temozolomide standard therapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter. The findings should be interpreted with caution, owing to the small size of the trial. FUNDING:German Federal Ministry of Education and Research."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Patients suffering from glioblastoma have a dismal prognosis, indicating the need for new therapeutic targets. Here we provide evidence that the DNA damage kinase HIPK2 and its negative regulatory E3-ubiquitin ligase SIAH1 are critical factors controlling temozolomide-induced cell death. We show that HIPK2 downregulation (HIPK2kd) significantly reduces the level of apoptosis. This was not the case in glioblastoma cells expressing the repair protein MGMT, suggesting that the primary DNA lesion responsible for triggering HIPK2-mediated apoptosis is O6-methylguanine. Upon temozolomide treatment, p53 becomes phosphorylated whereby HIPK2kd had impact exclusively on ser46, but not ser15. Searching for the transcriptional target of p-p53ser46, we identified the death receptor FAS (CD95, APO-1) being involved. Thus, the expression of FAS was attenuated following HIPK2kd, supporting the conclusion that HIPK2 regulates temozolomide-induced apoptosis via p-p53ser46 driven FAS expression. This was substantiated in chromatin-immunoprecipitation experiments, in which p-p53ser46 binding to the Fas promotor was regulated by HIPK2. Other pro-apoptotic proteins like PUMA, NOXA, BAX and PTEN were not affected in HIPK2kd, and also double-strand breaks following temozolomide remained unaffected. We further show that downregulation of the HIPK2 inactivator SIAH1 significantly ameliorates temozolomide-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the ATM/ATR target SIAH1 together with HIPK2 plays a proapoptotic role in glioma cells exhibiting p53wt status. A database analysis revealed that SIAH1, but not SIAH2, is significantly overexpressed in glioblastomas. Implications: The identification of a novel apoptotic pathway triggered by O6-methylguanine supports the role of p53 in the decision between survival and death and suggests SIAH1 and HIPK2 as new therapeutic targets."}

Temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy used to treat glioblastoma (GBM) and has been shown to have variable effects on immune response to immunotherapy. Therefore, we aimed to determine the immune modulatory effects of temozolomide that would impact response to immune checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of experimental GBM. Methods:Immune function and anti-tumor efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition were tested after treatment with metronomic dose (MD) temozolomide (25mg/kg x 10 days) or standard dose (SD) temozolomide (50 mg/kg x 5 days) in the GL261 and KR158 murine glioma models. Results:SD temozolomide treatment resulted in an upregulation of markers of T cell exhaustion such as LAG-3 and TIM-3 in lymphocytes which was not seen with MD temozolomide. When temozolomide treatment was combined with PD-1 antibody therapy, MD temozolomide / PD-1 antibody group demonstrated a decrease in exhaustion markers in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that were not observed in the SD temozolomide /PD-1 antibody group. Also, the survival advantage of PD-1 antibody therapy in a murine syngeneic intracranial glioma model was abrogated by adding SD temozolomide to treatment. However, when MD temozolomide was added to PD-1 inhibition, it preserved the survival benefit that was seen by PD-1 antibody therapy alone. Conclusion:The peripheral and intratumoral immune microenvironments are distinctively affected by dose modulation of temozolomide."}

Herein, we present a case series of three patients with metastatic melanoma who after progression on pembrolizumab showed a radiological response after just one cycle of metronomic temozolomide (75\u2009mg/m daily for 6 weeks on 8-week cycle).

It is traditionally investigated in vitro by culturing cells as a monolayer (2D culture) or as neurospheres (clusters enriched in cancer stem cells) but neither system accurately reflects the complexity of the three-dimensional (3D) chemoresistant microenvironment of GBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Using three GBM cell-lines (U87, U251, and SNB19), the effect of culturing cells in a Cultrex-based basement membrane extract (BME) [3D Tumour Growth Assay (TGA)] on morphology, gene expression, metabolism, and temozolomide chemoresistance was investigated. RESULTS:Cells were easily harvested from the 3D model and cultured as a monolayer (2D) and neurospheres. Indeed, the SNB19 cells formed neurospheres only after they were first cultured in the 3D model. The expression of CD133 and OCT4 was upregulated in the neurosphere and 3D assays respectively. Compared with cells cultured in the 2D model, cells were more resistant to temozolomide in the 3D model and this resistance was potentiated by hypoxia. CONCLUSION:Taken together, these results suggest that micro-environmental factors influence GBM sensitivity to temozolomide. Knowledge of the mechanisms involved in temozolomide resistance in this 3D model might lead to the identification of new strategies that enable the more effective use of the current standard of care agents."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "The standard treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surgery followed by chemo/radiotherapy. A major limitation on patient improvement is the high resistance of tumors to drug treatment, likely responsible for their subsequent recurrence and rapid progression. Therefore, alternatives to the standard therapy are necessary. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether mifepristone, an antihormonal agent, has a synergistic effect with temozolomide (used in standard therapy for gliomas). Whereas the mechanism of temozolomide involves damage to tumor DNA leading to apoptosis, tumor resistance is associated with DNA damage repair through the O\u2076-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) enzyme. Temozolomide/mifepristone treatment, herein examined in Wistar rats after orthotopically implanting C6 glioma cells, markedly reduced proliferation. This was evidenced by a decreased level of the following parameters: a proliferation marker (Ki-67), a tumor growth marker (18F-fluorothymidine uptake, determined by PET/CT images), and the MGMT enzyme. Increased apoptosis was detected by the relative expression of related proteins, (e.g. Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), Bax (bcl-2-like protein 4) and caspase-3). Thus, greater apoptosis of tumor cells caused by their diminished capacity to repair DNA probably contributed significantly to the enhanced activity of temozolomide. The results suggest that mifepristone could possibly act as a chemo-sensitizing agent for temozolomide during chemotherapy for GBM."}

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was widely employed to treat osteoporosis and some epidemiological studies showed that HRT regimes including progesterone analogs such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) decreased risk of glial tumors. Tibolone is a unique progesterone analog employed in HRT with tissue specific estrogenic effects and stimulates gene expressions very similar to those induced by MPA. Tibolone's pro-estrogenic effects occur particularly in bone and brain and both MPA and tibolone inhibit AKR1C enzymes, which involve in temozolomide chemoresistance. Hence, we aimed to investigate interactions between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide in modification of glioma cell growth and fine structure. PATIENTS AND METHODS:For our studies, we have particularly chosen C6 rat glioma cell line due to several reasons: i) We previously showed that MPA reduced growth and induced procarbazine-sensitization in C6 cells; ii) temozolomide has a triazene-type molecular structure like procarbazine; iii) other groups previously showed that C6 glioma cell line is more resistant to temozolomide than human glioma cells; hence it may provide a native model of chemoresistance. Monolayer plating efficacy, soft agar colony growth, 3D-spheroid S-phase (as determined by BrdU-labeling) and electron microscopical analyses were performed to assess mutual interactions between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide. RESULTS:MPA inhibited clonogenic growth of C6 glioma and this effect is augmented by both tibolone and temozolomide. MPA and tibolone inhibited DNA synthesis in C6 glioma spheroids to similar levels which can be achieved with temozolomide. Electron microscopical analyses revealed synergisms between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide involved mitochondrial proliferation, condensation, mitophagy and autophagy. CONCLUSIONS:MPA and tibolone shall be studied in further experimental models of glioblastoma in vitro and in vivo."}

However, its clinical applications suffer from serious side effects owing to the high concentration in blood and normal tissues. In this study, mathematical modelling is applied to simulate the liposome-mediated delivery of temozolomide under different conditions in a 3-D realistic brain tumour model reconstructed from MR images. Delivery outcomes are evaluated by the bioavailability of free temozolomide across time. As compared to the oral and intravenous administration of free temozolomide, liposome-mediated delivery can successfully improve the drug accumulation in tumour while reducing the drug exposure in blood and normal tissue. Results show that the delivery is less sensitive to the duration of intravenous infusion but highly dependent on the liposome properties. The treatment can be improved by either enhancing the liposome transvascular permeability or using the liposomes with high extracellular release rates. Intravascular release can only increase the risk of adverse effects rather than improving the drug bioavailability in tumour. Results obtained in this study could be applied for optimising the treatment using liposome encapsulated temozolomide."}

We have previously shown ectopic overexpression of CCND1 in human malignant gliomas cell lines. METHODS:Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot (WB) was performed to investigate the expression of CCND1 in glioma tissues and cell lines. The biological function of CCND1 was also investigated through knockdown and overexpression of BCYRN1 in vitro. RESULTS:Here we reported that CCND1 expression was positively associated with the pathological grade and proliferative activity of astrocytomas, as the lowest expression was found in normal brain tissue (N = 3) whereas the highest expression was in high-grade glioma tissue (N = 25). Additionally, we found that the expression level of CCND1 was associated with IC50 values in malignant glioma cell lines. Forced inhibition of CCND1 increased temozolomide efficacy in U251 and SHG-44 cells. After CCND1 overexpression, the temozolomide efficacy decreased in U251 and SHG-44 cells. Colony survival assay and apoptosis analysis confirmed that CCND1 inhibition renders cells more sensitive to temozolomide treatment and temozolomide-induced apoptosis in U251 and SHG-44 cells. Inhibition of P-gp (MDR1) by Tariquidar overcomes the effects of CCND1 overexpression on inhibiting temozolomide-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CCND1 inhibited cell growth in vitro and in vivo significantly more effectively after temozolomide treatments than single temozolomide treatments. Finally, inhibition of CCND1 in glioma cells reduced tumor volume in a murine model.

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "PURPOSE:Preclinical studies have suggested promising activity for the combination of disulfiram and copper (DSF/Cu) against glioblastoma (GBM) including re-sensitization to temozolomide (TMZ). A previous phase I study demonstrated the safety of combining DSF/Cu with adjuvant TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM. This phase II study aimed to estimate the potential effectiveness of DSF/Cu to re-sensitize recurrent GBM to TMZ. METHODS:This open-label, single-arm phase II study treated recurrent TMZ-resistant GBM patients with standard monthly TMZ plus concurrent daily DSF 80\u00a0mg PO TID and Cu 1.5\u00a0mg PO TID. Eligible patients must have progressed after standard chemoradiotherapy and within 3\u00a0months of the last dose of TMZ. Known isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant or secondary GBMs were excluded. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit (response or stable disease for at least 6\u00a0months), and safety. RESULTS:From March 2017 to January 2018, 23 recurrent TMZ-resistant GBM patients were enrolled across seven centers, and 21 patients were evaluable for response. The median duration of DSF/Cu was 1.6 cycles (range: 0.1-12.0). The ORR was 0%, but 14% had clinical benefit. Median PFS was 1.7\u00a0months, and median OS was 7.1\u00a0months. Only one patient (4%) had dose-limiting toxicity (grade three elevated alanine transaminase). CONCLUSIONS:Addition of DSF/Cu to TMZ for TMZ-resistant IDH-wild type GBM appears well tolerated but has limited activity for unselected population."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Temozolomide was recognized as the first-line therapy for glioblastoma to prolong the survival of patients noticeably, while recent clinical studies found that some patients were not sensitive to temozolomide treatment. The possible mechanisms seemed to be methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), mismatch repair, PARP, etc. And the abnormal expression of MGMT might be the most direct factor. In this study, we provide evidence that Fstl1 plays a vital role in temozolomide resistance by sequentially regulating DIP2A protein distribution, H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac), and MGMT transcription. As a multifunctional protein widely distributed in cells, DIP2A cooperates with the HDAC2-DMAP1 complex to enhance H3K9Ac deacetylation, prevent MGMT transcription, and increase temozolomide sensitivity. Fstl1, a glycoprotein highly expressed in glioblastoma, competitively binds DIP2A to block DIP2A nuclear translocation, so as to hinder DIP2A from binding the HDAC2-DMAP1 complex. The overexpression of Fstl1 promoted the expression of MGMT in association with increased promoter H3K9Ac. Upregulation of Fstl1 enhanced temozolomide resistance, whereas Fstl1 silencing obviously sensitized GBM cells to temozolomide both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, DIP2A depletion abolished the effects of Fstl1 on MGMT expression and temozolomide resistance. These findings highlight an important role of Fstl1 in the regulation of temozolomide resistance by modulation of DIP2A/MGMT signaling."}

METHODS:The current study included 102 patients with GBM that had been newly diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 who underwent our iFC analysis and received the standard treatment protocol. We evaluated MI values in each patient, then statistically analyzed the relationship between MI and prognosis using survival analysis that include other clinicopathological factors (age, sex, Karnofsky performance status [KPS], extent of resection, second-line bevacizumab, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase [MGMT] status, MIB-1 labeling index, and mutation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene [IDH1]). RESULTS:Log-rank test revealed that age, KPS, extent of resection, MGMT status, IDH1 mutation, and high MI (\u226526.3%) significantly correlated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis with Cox regression modeling identified MI as the most significant prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 2.246; 95% confidence interval = 1.347-3.800; P = .0019). MI showed strong correlation with IDH1 mutation status in chi-square test (P = .0023). In addition, log-rank test revealed that MI affects overall survival more strongly in patients with IDH1 wildtype than those with IDH1 mutant. CONCLUSION:MI from an iFC study may help predict the prognosis in patients with GBM who receive the standard treatment. Survival can be related to sensitivity to radio-chemotherapy."}

Although MCCK1 alone showed inhibitory effects on in vitro proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT of U251MG and U-87MG cells, combination of MCCK1 and TMZ showed enhanced inhibitory effects. In the U251MG GBM xenograft models, MCCK1 showed synergistic therapeutic effects in combination with TMZ to reduce tumor volumes significantly.

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Despite advances in cancer therapies, glioblastoma multiforme treatment remains inefficient due to the brain-blood barrier (BBB) inhibitory activity and to the low temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapeutic selectivity. To improve therapeutic outcomes, in this work we propose two strategies, (i) photodynamic therapy (PDT) as adjuvant treatment and (ii) engineering of multifunctional theranostic/targeted nanoparticles ( m-NPs) that integrate biotin as a targeting moiety with rhodamine-B as a theranostic agent in pluronic P85/F127 copolymers. These smart m-NPs can surmount the BBB and coencapsulate multiple cargoes under optimized conditions. Overall, the present study conducts a rational m-NP design, characterization, and optimizes the formulation conditions. Confocal microscopy studies on T98-G, U87-MG, and U343 glioblastoma cells and on NIH-3T3 normal fibroblast cells show that the m-NPs and the encapsulated drugs are selectively taken up by tumor cells presenting a broad intracellular distribution. The formulations display no toxicity in the absence of light and are not toxic to healthy cells, but they exert a robust synergic action in cancer cells in the case of concomitant PDT/TMZ treatment, especially at low TMZ concentrations and higher light doses, as demonstrated by nonlinear dose-effect curves based on the Chou-Talalay method. The results evidenced different mechanisms of action related to the disjoint cell cycle phases at the optimal PDT/TMZ ratio. This effect favors synergism between the PDT and the chemotherapy with TMZ, enhances the antiproliferative effect, and overcomes cross-resistance mechanisms. These results point out that m-NP-based PDT adjuvant therapy is a promising strategy to improve TMZ-based glioblastoma multiforme treatments."}

Specifically, multicellular spheroids deriving from either 5 patients with glioblastoma (GBM) or a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) PDX model were incorporated into VersaGel and treated with temozolomide and several other therapies, guided by the most recent advances in GBM treatment. RCC ex vivo tissue displayed invasive phenotypes in conditioned media. For the GBM patient tumor testing, all five clinical responses were predicted by the results of our 3D-temozolomide assay. In contrast, the MTT assay found no response to temozolomide regardless of the clinical outcome, and moreover, basement membrane extract failed to predict the 2 patient responders. Finally, 1 patient was tested with repurposed drugs currently being administered in GBM clinical trials. Interestingly, IC50s were lower than C max for crizotinib and chloroquine, but higher for sorafenib. In conclusion, a novel hydrogel platform, VersaGel, enables ex vivo tumor growth of patient and PDX tissue and offers insight into patient response to clinically relevant therapies.

METHODS:Nationwide population-based cohort study including all patients with newly-diagnosed and histologically confirmed glioblastoma in France in 2008 and followed until 2015. RESULTS:Data from 2053 glioblastoma patients were analyzed (male/female ratio 1.5, median age 64\u00a0years). Median overall survival (OS) was 11.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.7-11.9] months. The first-line therapy and corresponding median survival (MS, in months) were: 13% did not receive any oncological treatment (biopsy only) (MS\u2009=\u20091.8, 95% CI 1.6-2.1), 27% received treatment without the combination of radiotherapy (RT)-temozolomide (MS\u2009=\u20095.9, 95% CI 5.5-6.6), 60% received treatment including the initiation of the concomitant phase of RT-temozolomide (MS\u2009=\u200916.4, 95% CI 15.2-17.4) whom 44% of patients initiated the temozolomide adjuvant phase (MS\u2009=\u200918.9, 95% CI 18.0-19.8).

However, temozolomide does not reach the brain in sufficient doses when administered orally and has poor efficiency in more than half of the patients. Strategies to improve the treatment of glial malignancies are therefore needed. We have recently developed a system (Temodex) for local administration of temozolomide by encapsulating the drug in a biologically inert matrix. Here, we assessed the effect of Temodex in combination with standard therapy in a small-scale clinical study. Since the efficacy of temozolomide therapy is known to depend on the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene (MGMT) promoter, we also analyzed whether the effect of Temodex was influenced by the methylation status of MGMT. Our data show that the combination of standard therapy and Temodex was more efficient than standard therapy alone, promoting the overall patient survival by up to 33 weeks. Moreover, the efficacy of Temodex was not dependent on the methylation status of MGMT. Local Temodex administration in combination with standard therapy thereby emerges as a novel therapeutic option, with applicability that is independent on the methylation status of the MGMT promoter."}

Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating cytostaticum and has been reported to reduce pituitary tumor size and hormone hypersecretion, However, this is far from enough. Pituitary adenomas have relatively high expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Therefore, antiangiogenic agent has been used in a small number of aggressive or malignant pituitary tumors after recurrence. Apatinib (YN968D1) is a small-molecule antiangiogenic agent that selectively inhibits VEGFR-2 and also mildly inhibits c-Kit and c-Src tyrosine kinases, abundant in invasive pituitary adenomas. CASE PRESENTATION:present a 41-year-old female with a growth hormone (GH)-secreting invasive pituitary adenoma causing menstrual disorder and headache symptoms. Over three years, she underwent four surgeries and a stereotactic radiosurgery, but the results were poor. Two months after the fourth operation, she started treatment with temozolomide (200mg/m2, d1-5, 28d, orally) and apatinib (0.425g, daily, orally). Her GH level dropped to normal with a >90% decrease in tumor size, after 1-year treatment. There was no evidence of recurrence by imaging or by serum GH levels over 31.5 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION:we successfully treated this patient with recurrent invasive pituitary adenoma with temozolomide and apatinib for 31.5 months without recurrence. Angiogenesis is an active process in the cases of invasive pituitary adenomas that cannot be controlled by conventional therapy."}

Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the ability of temozolomide to induce senescence in glioblastoma cells. Temozolomide-induced senescence was triggered by the specific DNA lesion O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) and characterized by arrest of cells in the G2-M phase. Inhibitor experiments revealed that temozolomide-induced senescence was initiated by damage recognition through the MRN complex, activation of the ATR/CHK1 axis of the DNA damage response pathway, and mediated by degradation of CDC25c. Temozolomide-induced senescence required functional p53 and was dependent on sustained p21 induction. p53-deficient cells, not expressing p21, failed to induce senescence, but were still able to induce a G2-M arrest. p14 and p16, targets of p53, were silenced in our cell system and did not seem to play a role in temozolomide-induced senescence. In addition to p21, the NF-\u03baB pathway was required for senescence, which was accompanied by induction of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Upon temozolomide exposure, we found a strong repression of the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MSH6, and EXO1 as well as the homologous recombination protein RAD51, which was downregulated by disruption of the E2F1/DP1 complex. Repression of these repair factors was not observed in G2-M arrested p53-deficient cells and, therefore, it seems to represent a specific trait of temozolomide-induced senescence. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings reveal a mechanism by which the anticancer drug temozolomide induces senescence and downregulation of DNA repair pathways in glioma cells."}

Overexpression of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was identified in human GBM specimens that were MGMT methylated but showed poor survival. This correlation was confirmed in an independent cohort of human GBM. MIF overexpression has been reported in several cancer types, including GBM. We repurposed ibudilast, a specific MIF inhibitor, and treated patient derived cell lines. Ibudilast showed modest anti-proliferative activity however, when combined with TMZ, significant synergism was observed, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, combined ibudilast and TMZ treatment of a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model resulted in significantly longer overall survival. Our findings have significant clinical implications for people with GBM.

A clinically optimized cutoff was sought allowing patient selection for therapy without temozolomide, while avoiding to withhold it from patients who may potentially benefit.Experimental Design: Quantitative MGMT methylation-specific PCR data were obtained for newly diagnosed patients with GBM screened or treated with standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in four randomized trials. The pooled dataset was randomly split into a training and test dataset. The unsupervised cutoff was obtained at a 50% probability to be (un)methylated. ROC analysis identified an optimal cutoff supervised by overall survival (OS).Results: For 4,041 patients valid MGMT results were obtained, whereof 1,725 were randomized. The unsupervised cutoff in the training dataset was 1.27 (log2[1,000 \u00d7 (MGMT+1)/ACTB]), separating unmethylated and methylated patients. The optimal supervised cutoff for unmethylated patients was -0.28 (AUC = 0.61), classifying \"truly unmethylated\" (\u2264-0.28) and \"gray zone\" patients (>-0.28, \u22641.27), the latter comprising approximately 10% of cases. In contrast, for patients with MGMT methylation (>1.27) more methylation was not related to better outcome. Both methylated and gray zone patients performed significantly better for OS than truly unmethylated patients [HR = 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.45, P < 0.0001; HR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.43-0.78, P < 0.001], validated in the test dataset. The MGMT assay was highly reproducible upon retesting of 218 paired samples (R 2 = 0.94).Conclusions: Low MGMT methylation (gray zone) may confer some sensitivity to temozolomide treatment, hence the lower safety margin should be considered for selecting patients with unmethylated GBM into trials omitting temozolomide."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Despite significant advances in the understanding of glioblastoma genetics and biology, survival is still poor. Hypoxia and nutrient depletion in the tumour microenvironment induce adaptive signalling and metabolic responses, which can influence sensitivity to therapeutic regimens. DNA damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4) is a protein induced by hypoxia and in response to DNA stress. Mechanistically, DDIT4 inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling by activation of the tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2) complex. METHODS:Using short hairpin RNA-mediated gene suppression as well as doxycycline-regulated gene induction, we developed a glioblastoma cell model to study effects of DDIT4 under conditions of the glioblastoma microenvironment and therapy. RESULTS:We found an intact DDIT4-mTORC1 signalling axis in human glioblastoma cells that was inducible by hypoxia. Temozolomide and radiotherapy also induced DDIT4 and repressed mTORC1 activity in some glioblastoma cell lines. DDIT4 gene suppression sensitised glioma cells towards hypoxia-induced cell death, while DDIT4 overexpression protected them. Additionally, in clonogenic survival analyses, DDIT4 induction conferred protection from radiotherapy and temozolomide, while DDIT4 gene suppression sensitised cells. CONCLUSIONS:We identified DDIT4 as a cell-intrinsic regulator for adaptive responses and therapy resistance in glioblastoma cells which may interfere with cell death induction by temozolomide, radiotherapy or hypoxia by inhibiting mTORC1 activity."}

Although chemotherapy combining 5fluorouracil (5FU)-dacarbazine (DTIC) or temozolomide (TEM)-capecitabine (CAP) are extensively used in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET), they were never compared. We compared their tolerance and efficacy in advanced NET. METHODS:We evaluated the records of consecutive patients with pancreatic or small-intestine advanced NET who received 5FU-DTIC or TEM-CAP between July 2004 and December 2017 in five French centers. Tolerance, tumor response and progression-free survival (PFS) were compared. Factors associated with PFS were analyzed using Cox multivariate regression model. To reduce the confounding bias of the nonrandomized design, PFS was compared using propensity score analyses. RESULTS:Ninety-four (5FU-DTIC) patients and 153 (TEM-CAP) patients were included. Pancreatic NET represented 82.3% of cases and 17.1%, 61.8% and 10.9% of patients had G1, G2 or G3 NET, respectively. Progression at baseline was reported in 92.7% of patients with available data. Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 24.7% and 8.5% of TEM-CAP and 5FU-DTIC patients, respectively (p=0.002). The overall response rate was 38.3% and 39.2%, respectively (p=0.596). Median PFS on raw analysis was similar with 5FU-DTIC and TEM-CAP (13.9 vs. 18.3 months, respectively p=0.86). TEM-CAP was associated with an increased risk of progression on the raw multivariate analysis (HR 1.90, 95% CI [1.32-2.73], p=0.001) and when adjusted on propensity score (HR 1.65, 95% CI [1.18-2.31], p=0.004). CONCLUSION:PFS may be longer with 5FU-DTIC than TEM-CAP in patients with advanced NET. Although patients often prefer oral chemotherapy, 5FU-DTIC is a relevant alternative. A randomized comparison is needed to confirm these results. <br>."}

The level of MGMT promoter methylation did not correlate with patients' gender (p = 0.409), age (p = 0.536), and OS (p = 0.394). Treatment with TMZ significantly prolonged the median survival of a patient (from 5 to 15 months; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Due to a small cohort of primary GBM patients, our study is not sufficient for definitive conclusions regarding the prognostic value of MGMT methylation for the Serbian population. Our preliminary data suggest a lack of association between MGMT promoter methylation and overall survival and a significant correlation of TMZ treatment with overall survival. Further population-based studies are needed to assess the prognostic value of the MGMT promoter methylation status for patients with primary glioblastoma."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Standard-of-care treatment of glioblastomas involves maximal safe resection and adjuvant temozolomide chemo-radiotherapy. Although extent of resection (EOR) is a well-known surgical predictor for overall survival most lesions cannot be completely resected. We hypothesize that in the event of incomplete resection, residual tumor volume (RTV) may be a more significant predictor than EOR. This was a multicenter retrospective review of 147 adult glioblastoma patients (mean age 53\u202fyears) that underwent standard treatment. Semiautomatic magnetic resonance imaging segmentation was performed for pre- and postoperative scans for volumetric analysis. Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were performed for prognostic factors including: age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status, EOR and RTV. EOR and RTV cut-off values for improved OS were determined and internally validated by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis for 12-month overall survival. Half of the tumors had MGMT promoter methylation (77, 52%). The median tumor volume, EOR and RTV were 43.20\u202fcc, 93.5%, and 3.80\u202fcc respectively. Gross total resection was achieved in 52 patients (35%). Cox proportional hazards regression, ROC and maximum Youden index analyses for RTV and EOR showed that a cut-off value of <3.50\u202fcc (HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.48-0.98) and \u226584% (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43-0.96) respectively conferred an overall survival advantage. Independent overall survival predictors were MGMT promoter methylation (adjusted HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.23-0.55) and a RTV of <3.50\u202fcc (adjusted HR 0.53; 95% CI 0.29-0.95), but not EOR for incompletely resected glioblastomas."}

Methods:Wistar rats (n = 30) were divided into three groups (n = 10 per group) to determine optimal CUES conditions for achieving BBB permeability, as assessed by ultrastructure transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and western blot assays for the tight junction protein claudin-5. Optimized mCEUS effects on BBB permeability were subsequently confirmed with Evans blue staining (2 groups of 10 rats). The glioma cell line 9L was injected into the brain striatum of Wistar rats. After temozolomide chemotherapy, we detected glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and in brain tissue by western blot, immunocytochemistry, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results:BBB permeability was maximized with 1\u2009ml/kg contrast agent mCEUS delivered via 10-min intermittent launches with a 400-ms interval. Evans blue staining confirmed BBB permeability following ultrasonic cavitation in the control group (P < 0.05). Following temozolomide chemotherapy, levels of the tumor marker GFAP were increased in the group with ultrasonic cavitation compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusions:When rats were treated by mCEUS with intermittent launches (interval, 400\u2009ms) and injected with 1\u2009mg/kg contrast agent, BBB permeability was increased and temozolomide BBB penetration was enhanced, therapeutic enhancement for glioblastoma."}

We evaluated the modulatory effects of RFP knockdown on cis-regulatory elements, gene expression, and chemosensitivity to temozolomide both in glioblastoma cells and in an intracranial glioblastoma model. The combination of RFP knockdown and temozolomide treatment markedly suppressed the glioblastoma cell growth due to oxidative stress and aberrant cell cycle and increased survival time in mice with glioblastoma. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq revealed that RFP knockdown increased or decreased activity of numerous cis-regulatory elements that lie adjacent to genes that control functions such as apoptosis, mitosis, DNA replication, and cell cycle: FOXO1, TBP2, and PARPBP. This study suggests that RFP contributes to chemoresistance via aberrant deacetylation of histone H3 at K27, whereas dysregulation of RFP-associated cis-regulatory elements in glioma and RFP knockdown combined with temozolomide is an effective treatment strategy for lethal glioma."}

Clarifying the underlying mechanism of chemoresistance might yield novel strategies to improve the patients' response to chemotherapeutics. Mounting evidence indicates that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in chemoresistance and tumorigenesis. At present, miR-7-5p has been recognized as a tumor suppressor involved in multiple cancers. However, the biological effects of miR-7-5p in TMZ resistance have not been illuminated. In this study, we used RNA sequencing and high-throughput screening techniques, which revealed that miR-7-5p is significantly downregulated in TMZ resistant LN229 cells (LN229/TMZ-R) compared to control cells (LN229), and low miR-7-5p expression was correlated with recurrence in GBM patients. Ectopic overexpression of miR-7-5p sensitized LN229/TMZ-R cells to TMZ and suppressed the stemness of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Further experiments demonstrated that miR-7-5p exerts its role by directly targeting the 3'-untranslated region of Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Our findings suggest that combinational use of miR-7-5p and TMZ might be a promising therapeutic strategy to increase the long-term drug response in GBM patients."}

The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival. Secondary endpoint was the radiological response. RESULTS:A total of 48 patients were included. Mean age was 43 years (range: 19-66 years), 26 were male (54.1%). Twenty-one patients received PCV and 27 temozolomide. The baseline characteristics were not difference between the groups. The progression-free survival and overall survival in the PCV group were 7.2 and 10.6 years respectively and temozolomide were 6.1 and 9.2 years, both statistically significant. The radiological response was present in 80.9% in PCV arm and 70.2% in temozolomide arm there was not statistical differences. The multivariate Cox model showed only the significant parameters the use of PCV protocol. The toxicity grade 3 or 4 was present in 42.8% in PCV arm and 11.1% in temozolomide arm.

The combination of capecitabine (CAP) and temozolomide (TEM) is associated with an extremely high and long-lasting response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, there is little evidence showing that the CAPTEM regimen is effective for TAC. For patients with unresectable or metastatic atypical carcinoid of the thymus, few treatment options are available, and the treatment efficacy is not satisfactory. To explore the efficacy and safety of the CAPTEM regimen against TAC, we conducted a retrospective review. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A total of nine patients with advanced atypical carcinoid of the thymus in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital were treated with capecitabine (750 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1-14) and temozolomide (200 mg/m2 once daily, days 10-14) every 28 days between 2014 and 2018. The disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse effects after treatment were analyzed. The DCR was calculated by RECIST version 1.1. Progression-free survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival method. RESULTS:A total of nine patients (six male and three female) were included. The median age at CAPTEM initiation was 50 years (range, 26-58). The median number of CAPTEM cycles was 8 (range, 3-23). The DCR was 89% (8/9), with eight patients achieving stable disease. Only one patient (11%) showed progressive disease. The median PFS was 8 months. Because we applied vitamin B6 and ondansetron before administering the drugs, the side effects of this regimen were very small. Adverse reactions were all below grade 3 and included myelosuppression and digestive tract reaction. CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that the CAPTEM regimen may be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of TAC. More evidence is needed to validate the effectiveness of this regimen. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Capecitabine and temozolomide regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced thymic atypical carcinoid."}

We found CAXII and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) coexpressed in neurospheres derived from 3 of 3 patients with different genetic backgrounds and low response to temozolomide (time to recurrence: 6-9 months). CAXII was necessary for the Pgp efflux of temozolomide and second-line chemotherapeutic drugs, determining chemoresistance in neurospheres. Psammaplin C, a potent inhibitor of CAXII, resensitized primary neurospheres to temozolomide by reducing temozolomide efflux via Pgp. This effect was independent of other known temozolomide resistance factors present in the patients. The overall survival in orthotopic patient-derived xenografts of temozolomide-resistant neurospheres, codosed with Psammaplin C and temozolomide, was significantly increased over temozolomide-treated (P < 0.05) and untreated animals (P < 0.02), without detectable signs of systemic toxicity. We propose that a CAXII inhibitor in combination with temozolomide may provide a new and effective approach to reverse chemoresistance in glioblastoma stem cells. This novel mechanism of action, via the interaction of CAXII and Pgp, ultimately blocks the efflux function of Pgp to improve glioblastoma patient outcomes.

Treatment with temozolomide, standard of care for gliomas, usually results in drug resistance and tumor recurrence. Therefore, there is a great need for drugs that target GBM. NEO214 was generated by covalently linking rolipram to perillyl alcohol (POH) via a carbamate bond to form the rolipram-perillyl alcohol conjugate. We show here that NEO214 is effective against both temozolomide-sensitive and temozolomide-resistant glioma cells. Furthermore, NEO214 is effective for different mechanisms of temozolomide resistance: overexpression of MGMT (O6-methylguanine methyl-transferase); deficiency in specific mismatch repair proteins; and overexpression of base excision repair (BER) proteins. NEO214-induced cytotoxicity involves apoptosis triggered by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as well as activating the Death Receptor 5 (DR5)/TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) pathway. In vitro studies show that glioma cells treated with NEO214 express DR5 and exhibit cell death in the presence of recombinant TRAIL, a growth factor constitutively produced by astrocytes. Our in vitro 3D coculture data show that induction of DR5 in glioma cells with NEO214 and TRAIL cause tumor cell death very effectively and specifically for glioma cells. In vivo studies show that NEO214 has antitumor efficacy in orthotropic syngeneic rodent tumor models. Furthermore, NEO214 has therapeutic potential especially for brain tumors because this drug can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and is effective in the TRAIL-rich astrocyte microenvironment.

Combination of veliparib and temozolomide was well-tolerated and demonstrated clinical activity in older patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or AML arising from pre-existing myeloid malignancies. We aimed to perform quantitative assessments of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of veliparib in this patient population to inform future trial design. METHODS:Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Phoenix\u00ae NLME with pharmacokinetic data obtained from 37 subjects after oral administration of veliparib in a Phase I study with and without temozolomide. Effect of covariates (age, sex, BMI, creatinine clearance (CLCR), and co-administration of temozolomide) on the pharmacokinetics of veliparib were evaluated, as well as impact of veliparib exposure on mucositis (dose-limiting toxicity), objective response rate (ORR), and overall survival. RESULTS:A two-compartment model with first-order elimination and a first-order absorption with lag-time adequately described veliparib pharmacokinetics. CLCR and body weight were clinically significant covariates for veliparib disposition. The proportion of subjects with all grade mucositis increased with veliparib exposure (AUC). However, no trend in ORR and overall survival was observed with increasing exposure. CONCLUSIONS:Veliparib with temozolomide presents a promising combination for older patients with myeloid leukemias. An exposure-safety relationship was established for this combination.

The aim of this study is to assess the role of postsurgical treatments. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS:We evaluated patients with LGGs with IDH mut and 1p19q codel; IDH1/2 was performed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In all wild-type cases, we performed next-generation sequencing. 1p19 codel analysis was performed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS:Among the 679 patients, 93 with LGGs with IDH mutation and 1p19q codel were included. Median follow-up (FU) was 96.1\u2009months. Eighty-four patients (90.3%) were high risk according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. After surgery, 50 patients (53.7%) received only FU, 17 (18.3%) chemotherapy (CT), and 26 (30.1%) radiotherapy (RT) with (RT\u2009+\u2009CT, 8 patients, 8.6%) or without (RT, 18 patients, 19.4%) chemotherapy. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) was 46.3\u2009months, 50.8 months, 103.6\u2009months, and 120.2\u2009months in patients with FU alone, with CT alone, with RT alone, or with RT\u2009+\u2009CT, respectively. Median PFS was significantly longer in patients who received postsurgical treatment (79.5\u2009months, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 66.4-92.7) than patients who received FU (46.3 months, 95% CI: 36.0-56.5). Moreover, mPFS was longer in patients who received RT (alone or in combination with CT, n\u2009=\u200926, 113.8 months, 95% CI: 57.2-170.5) than those who did not (n\u2009=\u200967, 47.3\u2009months, 95% CI: 36.4-58.2). In particular, temozolomide alone did not improve PFS with respect to FU. CONCLUSION:RT with or without chemotherapy, but not temozolomide alone, could extend PFS in IDH mut 1p19q codel LGGs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Low-grade gliomas with high-risk features, defined according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria, receive radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy as postsurgical treatments. Radiotherapy, however, has serious long-term effects (cognitive impairment), which are to be taken into account in these young patients. Moreover, low-grade gliomas with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and 1p19q codeletion (oligodendrogliomas) have an extremely long survival and a better prognosis. This study suggests that postsurgical treatments prolong the time before tumor progression in patients with good prognosis as well as those with oligodendroglioma.

In this study, we discovered that the increasing hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1\u00a0(HIF-1\u03b1) activated the hedgehog pathway in hypoxic microenvironment by promoting autocrine secretion of sonic hedgehog protein (Shh), and then upregulating transfer of Gli1 to the nucleus, finally contributed to TMZ resistance in glioma cells. Oroxylin A (C16H12O5), a bioactive flavonoid, could induce HIF-1\u03b1 degradation via prolyl-hydroxylases-VHL signaling pathway, resulting in the inactivation of the hedgehog. Besides, oroxylin A increased the expression of Sufu, which is a negative regulator of Gli1. By this mechanism, oroxylin A sensitized TMZ on glioma cells.

Nevertheless, few randomized, prospective clinical trials have analyzed these factors, and very little is known in the real-clinical world. We evaluated these characteristics in glioblastoma patients treated with standard first-line therapy outside clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS:In total, 111 newly, histologically diagnosed glioblastoma patients treated at our oncology center with radiotherapy and temozolomide were prospectively enrolled. No patient was enrolled in an experimental clinical trial. We assessed HRQoL, cognitive function, and psychological status before starting treatment, at the end of radiotherapy, and every 3 months until 9 months after the end of radiotherapy using EORTC QLQ-C30, BN20, MMSE, and HADS questionnaires. RESULTS:Global health status, physical, cognitive, and social functioning remained unchanged throughout the study period. A statistically significant change was found in emotional functioning as well as a clinically meaningful amelioration in role functioning between the baseline assessment and 9 months after radiotherapy. Patients older than 65 years reported greater impairment on the bladder control scale than younger patients. When considering tumor location, global health status, communication deficit, and drowsiness, scores were significantly different between the right and left hemispheres. Female patients had a clinically relevant lower score for physical functioning at baseline and 3 months after radiation therapy. Female patients also had a clinically relevant lower depression score at 9 months after radiation therapy. CONCLUSIONS:In routine neurooncology practice, HRQoL, cognitive function, and psychological status did not worsen during first-line treatment in glioblastoma patients receiving standard radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment.

Trypan blue exclusion assays were used to determine effects of DHT/TMZ combinatorial treatment on GBM cell viability.

An in vitro model of the BBB was constructed to predict the potential of DHT to penetrate the BBB in vivo. DHT and TMZ synergistically reduce cancer cell viability, NFkB activity, and markedly halt cell cycle progression. This regimen was also shown to exert minimal effects on astrocytes. Finally, DHT was shown to have the potential of passing through the BBB to a similar extent as TMZ and that paclitaxel's oncolytic effects are completely ablated in the presence of our in vitro BBB. Our data confirms the synergistic interaction between DHT and TMZ and also highlights the potential of combination treatment to sequester NFkB activity and inhibit cell cycle progression.

Programmed cell death 10 (PDCD10), a ubiquitously expressed apoptotic protein, has shown a dual function in different types of cancers and in chemo-resistance. Recently, we reported that PDCD10 was downregulated in human GBM. The aim of this study was to explore the function of PDCD10 in GBM cells. METHODS:PDCD10 was knocked down in three GBM cell lines (U87, T98g and LN229) by lentiviral-mediated shRNA transduction. U87 and T98g transduced cells were used for phenotype study and LN229 and T98g cells were used for apoptosis study. The role of PDCD10 in apoptosis and chemo-resistance was investigated after treatment with staurosporine and temozolomide. A GBM xenograft mouse model was used to confirm the function of PDCD10 in vivo. A protein array was performed in PDCD10-knockdown and control GBM cells. RESULTS:Knockdown of PDCD10 in GBM cells promoted cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis and caspase-3 activation. PDCD10-knockdown accelerated tumor growth and increased tumor mass by 2.1-fold and led to a chemo-resistance of mice treated with temozolomide. Immunostaining revealed extensive Ki67-positive cells and less activation of caspase-3 in PDCD10-knockdown tumors. The protein array demonstrated an increased release of multiple growth factors from PDCD10-knockdown GBM cells. CONCLUSIONS:Loss of programmed cell death 10 activates tumor cells and leads to temozolomide-resistance in GBM, suggesting PDCD10 as a potential target for GBM therapy."}

The goal of this work was to develop models for prediction of survival of GBM patients that can integrate clinical information and multi-omic profiles, using multi-layered Bayesian regressions. We apply the methodology to data from GBM patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 501) to evaluate whether integrating multi-omic profiles (SNP-genotypes, methylation, copy number variants and gene expression) with clinical information (demographics as well as treatments) leads to an improved ability to predict patient survival. The proposed Bayesian models were used to estimate the proportion of variance explained by clinical covariates and omics and to evaluate prediction accuracy in cross validation (using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, AUC). Among clinical and demographic covariates, age (AUC = 0.664) and the use of temozolomide (AUC = 0.606) were the most predictive of survival. Among omics, methylation (AUC = 0.623) and gene expression (AUC = 0.593) were more predictive than either SNP (AUC = 0.539) or CNV (AUC = 0.547). While there was a clear association between age and methylation, the integration of age, the use of temozolomide, and either gene expression or methylation led to a substantial increase in AUC in cross-validaton (AUC = 0.718). Finally, among the genes whose methylation was higher in aging brains, we observed a higher enrichment of these genes being also differentially methylated in cancer."}

The miR-181 family was discovered to play an important role in regulating biological functions in glioma, and miR-181b is less expressed in human gliomas as a tumor-suppressive miRNA. The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanism of miR-181b-5p and its target gene on modulating TMZ chemosensitivity in glioma cells. The enhanced chemosensitivity effect of miR-181b-5p to TMZ in glioma cells U87MG and U251 was detected by MTT method. Dual luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were performed to demonstrate that miR-181b-5p directly targets Bcl-2 to reduce the expression. Transwell and \ufb02ow cytometry assays showed that combination of miR-181b-5p and TMZ exerted stronger effects on inhibiting U87MG cells proliferation, migration and invasion as well as promoting apoptosis and S phase arrest than miR-181b-5p and TMZ alone. The same tendency was observed in the upregulation of apoptosis-related protein Bax and downregulation of cycle-related proteins CyclinD1 and CDK4. In vivo experiments indicated that miR-181b-5p could enhance the tumor-suppressive effect of TMZ. In conclusion, our findings indicate that upregulation of miR-181b-5p targets Bcl-2 directly and may function as an important modifier to sensitize glioma cells to TMZ."}

METHODS AND MATERIALS:Trial RTOG 04-20, a single-arm, multi-institutional phase 2 trial, was designed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of concomitant TMZ and radiation therapy (RT) followed by adjuvant TMZ combined with CPT-11 given for 12 cycles compared with historical controls of adjuvant TMZ alone given for 6 cycles. RESULTS:A total of 170 patients were enrolled, 152 of whom were eligible. Adjuvant CPT-11 combined with TMZ was more toxic than expected. A higher rate of hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities was more frequently noted with the combination regimen compared with adjuvant TMZ alone. Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity was 38% compared with 14% reported in the Stupp trial. After an early interim analysis, the adjuvant CPT-11 dose was reduced to 100\u00a0mg/m2 on days 1 and 5 for the first cycle. CPT-11 dose escalation proceeded over the first 3 cycles if tolerated. Median overall survival for all eligible patients was 16.9\u00a0months compared with 13.7\u00a0months of the historical control (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03). Post hoc subgroup analysis suggested an improvement in overall survival for patients with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class 3, although improvement was limited to 22 patients (14% of eligible patients). CONCLUSIONS:Although irinotecan and TMZ for 12 cycles given after chemoradiation for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma significantly improved median survival compared with historical control data at the time the study was conducted, the historical control median survival time of 13.7\u00a0months does not represent the current benchmark for this patient population. Treatment intensification does prolong overall survival compared with the current standard."}

However, the information about Cl- in cancer cell apoptosis and chemoresistance is poorly understood. In the present study, we found that temozolomide (TMZ) treatment led to a decrease in intracellular concentration of Cl- ([Cl-]i) in both U87 and TMZ-resistant U87/R glioma cells. The decrease in [Cl-]i was more noticeable in U87 cells than in U87/R cells. Moreover, the expression of LRRC8A was reduced in U87/R cells compared with U87 cells. LRRC8A downregulation inhibited TMZ, induced the decrease in [Cl-]i and abolished the difference of [Cl-]i between U87 cells and U87/R cells. Knockdown of LRRC8A using small interfering RNA attenuated TMZ-induced U87 cell growth inhibition and apoptosis, while overexpression of LRRC8A by adenoviral infection enhanced the effect of TMZ on U87 and U87/R cell viability and apoptosis. Furthermore, LRRC8A downregulation inhibited TMZ-induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, including elevated Bcl-2 expression, reduced Bax expression, cytochrome c release, and caspase nine and caspase three activation. On the contrary, upregulation of LRRC8A augmented the activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway in U87 and U87/R cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that LRRC8A potentiates TMZ-induced glioma cell apoptosis via promoting mitochondria-dependent apoptosis, suggesting that LRRC8A can be represented as a novel target for drug resistance treatment in glioma cells."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a poor prognosis with an overall survival of 14-15 months after surgery, radiation and chemotherapy using temozolomide (TMZ). A major problem is that the tumors acquire resistance to therapy. In an effort to improve the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ, we performed a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) synthetic lethality screen to establish a functional gene signature for TMZ sensitivity in human GBM cells. We then queried the Connectivity Map database to search for drugs that would induce corresponding changes in gene expression. By this approach we identified several potential pharmacological sensitizers to TMZ, where the most potent drug was the established antipsychotic agent Thioridazine, which significantly improved TMZ sensitivity while not demonstrating any significant toxicity alone. Mechanistically, we show that the specific chemosensitizing effect of Thioridazine is mediated by impairing autophagy, thereby preventing adaptive metabolic alterations associated with TMZ resistance. Moreover, we demonstrate that Thioridazine inhibits late-stage autophagy by impairing fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Finally, Thioridazine in combination with TMZ significantly inhibits brain tumor growth in vivo, demonstrating the potential clinical benefits of compounds targeting the autophagy-lysosome pathway. Our study emphasizes the feasibility of exploiting drug repurposing for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for GBM."}

This study assessed the reduction in tumour volume following intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and temozolomide in this favourable and more responsive tumour pathology. 56 patients were managed from 2011 to 2014 and 53 had residual disease. To assess radiological response, tumour volumes were created on representative T1/T2Flair MRI sequences using identical slice-levels in three planes for pre-IMRT, month\u202f+\u202f3 and month\u202f+\u202f12 post-IMRT scans. Change in volumes was assessed between time periods. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from start of radiotherapy. Median follow-up for survivors is 48.2\u202fmonths. Pathology was anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AOD) and anaplastic astrocytoma IDH-mutated (AAmut) in 32 and 21 patients respectively. 93% received sequential chemotherapy. The median residual disease on T1 and T2Flair imaging was 9.7\u202fcm3 and 20.6\u202fcm3. 17 patients relapsed for projected 5\u202fyear PFS of 74.9%; with 8 isolated relapses within initial surgical site. On MRI at month\u202f+\u202f3, the median volume for T1 and T2Flair reduced by 69.4% and 67.3% respectively; which further decreased to 82.4% and 81.3% at month\u202f+\u202f12. By month\u202f+\u202f12, 69.2% and 62.2% of patients had >75% volume reduction. Patients with AOD had superior reduction at month\u202f+\u202f3 compared with AAmut (p\u202f=\u202f0.02); but equivalent reduction at month\u202f+\u202f12 (p\u202f=\u202f0.14). Thus, in patients with anaplastic glioma harbouring an IDH mutation, where an attempt at near-total resection may be associated with unacceptable morbidity, this data suggests that the radiation therapy may provide effective cytoreduction of residual disease."}

This study evaluates the implementation of the radiologic aspects of HERBY. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We analyzed multimodal imaging compliance rates and scan quality for participating sites, adjudication rates and reading times for the central review process, the influence of different Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria in the final response, the incidence of pseudoprogression, and the benefit of incorporating multimodal imaging into the decision process. RESULTS:Multimodal imaging compliance rates were the following: diffusion, 82%; perfusion, 60%; and spectroscopy, 48%. Neuroradiologists' responses differed for 50% of scans, requiring adjudication, with a total average reading time per patient of approximately 3 hours. Pseudoprogression occurred in 10/116 (9%) cases, 8 in the radiation therapy/temozolomide arm and 2 in the bevacizumab arm (P < .01). Increased target enhancing lesion diameter was a reason for progression in 8/86 cases (9.3%) but never the only radiologic or clinical reason. Event-free survival was predicted earlier in 5/86 (5.8%) patients by multimodal imaging (diffusion, n = 4; perfusion, n = 1). CONCLUSIONS:The addition of multimodal imaging to the response criteria modified the assessment in a small number of cases, determining progression earlier than structural imaging alone. Increased target lesion diameter, accounting for a large proportion of reading time, was never the only reason to designate disease progression."}

The survival rate of people with a malignant glioma is extremely low, primarily due to a lack of effective treatments. We previously reported that miR-196b expression is upregulated in glioblastoma tissues and overexpression of miR-196b is associated with poor prognosis. miR-196b acts as an oncogene by enhancing cellular proliferation and increasing the expression of E2F1, which plays an important role in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In the present study, we explored the effects of miR-196b expression on glioma cells and characterized the relationship between miR-196b expression and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. We found that downregulation of miR-196b decreased the proliferation of U87 and U251 glioma cells. When anti-miR-196b and radiotherapy were used together, cellular proliferation decreased, whereas apoptosis and caspase 3/7activity, an indicator of apoptosis, increased. Meanwhile, downregulation of miR-196b remarkably inhibited glioma cell growth and colony formation when concurrent with temozolomide administration. Further studies demonstrated that neither upregulation nor downregulation of miR-196b markedly changed the protein expression levels of downstream molecules in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in cellular experiments. Therefore, whether miR-196b plays a role by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway has not yet been determined. Together, our findings indicate that downregulation of miR-196b increased glioma cell sensitivity to temozolomide chemotherapy and radiotherapy and may be a valuable target when treating malignant gliomas. However, further studies are required to accurately characterize the mechanism by which miR-196b elicits its pivotal role."}

Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment, however, adjuvant therapy is sometimes necessary. Given the rarity of PXA, chemotherapeutic efficacy data is limited. The importance of the BRAF V600E mutation in the context of MAP kinase pathway inhibition is unknown. The purpose of this study was to perform an in vivo screen of a variety to agents to determine efficacy against both V600E mutant and non-mutant PXA. METHODS:The efficacy of bevacizumab, temozolomide, lomustine (CCNU), irinotecan (CPT 11), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (sorafenib), a selective MEK1/2 inhibitor (cobimetinib), and a BRAF inhibitor (vemurafenib) were assessed in two subcutaneous xenografts: D645 PXA (V600E-mutant) and D2363 PXA (V600E-non-mutant) (n\u2009=\u20095-10 mice). Select agents were also assessed in an intracranial model of D2363 PXA (n\u2009=\u20096-9). Subcutaneous tumor growth and survival were the endpoints. RESULTS:Temozolomide, bevacizumab, CPT 11, and sorafenib significantly inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in both V600E-mutant and V600E-non-mutant models (P\u2009<\u20090.05). MEK inhibition (cobimetinib) but not BRAF inhibition (vemurafenib) also inhibited tumor growth regardless of V600E mutation (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Temozolomide, CPT 11, and bevacizumab also prolonged survival in a V600E-non-mutant intracranial model (median overall survival (OS) 68.5, 62.5, and 42.5\u00a0days, respectively) in contrast to controls (31.5\u00a0days, P\u2009<\u20090.001). CONCLUSIONS:These findings suggest that when adjuvant treatment is clinically indicated for PXA, temozolomide, CPT 11, or bevacizumab may be considered. Additionally, a trial of a MEK inhibitor or tyrosine kinase inhibitor could be considered for PXA regardless of V600E mutation status."}

METHODS:A total of 64 patients who received temozolomide chemotherapy at our institution was included; 35 patients received full-dose chemo-radiotherapy as per the STUPP protocol (Group A), and 9 patients received abbreviated radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy (Group B). Twenty patients received temozolomide alone with an intended 12 cycles of therapy for first relapse at least 6 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (Group C). RESULTS:In Group A, 27 of 35 (77%) patients completed the chemo-radiotherapy phase; 14% had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia leading to discontinuation. Of 27 patients, 16 (59%) completed adjuvant chemotherapy. There were no grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias, but 4% discontinued due to grade 2 thrombocytopenias. In Group B, four of nine (45%) patients completed the chemo-radiotherapy phase; 11% had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias and discontinued treatment. Three of four (75%) patients completed adjuvant chemotherapy. Of these, 75% had grade 3-4 thrombocytopenias, but none discontinued. Finally, in Group C, 8 of 20 (40%) patients completed, with 10% discontinuing due to thrombocytopenias and the rest due to disease progression.

It is commonly misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma or grade-3 neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN). Management is not well-defined. METHODS:Retrospective analysis of prospectively entered data at our centre from January 2011 to January 2018 revealed 16 MiNENs off 130 neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). These were analysed for demographics, clinicopathological characteristics, management strategies and prognosis. RESULTS:Four out of 16 patients, metastatic at presentation, were started on chemotherapy. Eleven of remaining 12 patients had pre-operative biopsy. Only two were diagnosed MiNEN. Four patients (33.34%) received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent curative surgery with adjuvant cisplatin+etoposide (Cis-Eto). Out of these, two patients (16.6%) developed metastasis and were shifted to capecitabine+temozolomide (Cap-Tem). Six patients (50%) with neuroendocrine-dominant MiNEN received adjuvant Cis-Eto after surgery. Two (16.6%) developed metastases for which Cap-Tem was started. One of them developed locoregional and liver metastasis. Three patients (25%) have succumbed to progressive disease, three (25%) are on treatment, and six (50%) are disease-free at 4-30\u00a0months. CONCLUSION:Preoperative diagnosis of MiNEN is challenging, and it needs quality histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry. The 30% criteria is therapeutically insignificant, and treatment based on most aggressive component is prognostically more relevant. Neoadjuvant 5-FU-based regimens may downstage adenocarcinoma-dominant tumours. There are no guidelines on adjuvant Cis-Eto. Cap-Tem can be considered second-line chemotherapy. Poor survival is reported irrespective of site of origin and adjuvant therapy."}

To facilitate optimal dosing for such studies, we evaluated the plasma and brain pharmacokinetics (PK) of letrozole in NOD-scid gamma (NSG) mice, which are frequently employed for assessing efficacy against patient-derived tumor cells. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential PK interactions between letrozole and temozolomide (TMZ) in Sprague-Dawley rats. METHODS:NSG mice were administered letrozole (8\u00a0mg/kg; i.p) as a single or multiple dose (b.i.d, 10 days). Brain tissue and blood samples were collected over 24\u00a0h. Letrozole and TMZ interaction study employed jugular vein-cannulated rats (three groups; TMZ alone, letrozole alone and TMZ\u2009+\u2009letrozole). Intracerebral microdialysis was performed for brain extracellular fluid (ECF) collection simultaneously with venous blood sampling. Drug levels were measured employing HPLC and PK analysis was conducted using Phoenix WinNonlin\u00ae. RESULTS:In NSG mice, peak plasma and brain tissue letrozole concentrations (Cmax) were 3-4 and 0.8-0.9\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively. The elimination half-life was 2.6\u00a0h with minimal accumulation following multiple dosing. In the drug interaction study, no PK changes were evident when TMZ and letrozole were given in combination. For instance, peak plasma and brain ECF TMZ levels when given alone were 14.7\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 and 4.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.6\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively, and 12.6\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 and 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8\u00a0\u00b5g/ml, respectively, when given with letrozole.

Here, we show that PLK4 affects TMZ sensitivity by regulating the IKBKE/NF-\u03baB axis. The mRNA level of PLK4 was significantly associated with glioma grade progression and inversely correlated with overall survival (OS) in patients with high-grade gliomas (HGG). Further analyses indicated that GBM patients with low PLK4 expression levels gained greater survival benefits from chemotherapy than did those with high PLK4 expression. In GBM cells, TMZ sensitivity was decreased by ectopic expression of PLK4 and enhanced by depletion of PLK4. In the GBM mice model, inhibiting PLK4 in combination with chemotherapy slowed tumor growth and provided a significant survival benefit. Furthermore, PLK4 interacted with and phosphorylated IKBKE, leading to an increase in NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity and anti-apoptosis. Notably, the PLK4 inhibitor CFI400945, which is currently in clinical trials, had a synergistic effect with TMZ, increasing TMZ sensitivity in xenografts from patient-derived primary GBMs. Our work describes the PLK4-IKBKE signaling axis that influences GBM proliferation and chemosensitivity, and can enhance the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy via therapeutic targeting."}

It has a high recurrence rate and shows aggressive proliferation. The novel cytotoxic agent temozolomide (TMZ) is now frequently applied as the first-line chemotherapeutic treatment for GBM; however, a considerable number of patients treated with TMZ turn out to be refractory to this drug. Hence, a more effective therapeutic approach is urgently required to overcome this critical issue. Accumulating evidence has shown that both AMPK and AKT are activated by TMZ, while only AMPK contributes to apoptosis via mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. Accordingly, AKT increases the tumorigenicity and chemoresistance of various tumor cells. In addition, AKT overexpression increases the resistance of glioma cells to TMZ. Cordycepin, a major bioactive component in Cordyceps militaris, exhibits immunomodulatory, anticancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, among other therapeutic effects. To date, whether GBM sensitivity to TMZ can be enhanced by cordycepin largely remains unknown. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of the combined use of cordycepin and TMZ in the treatment of GBM and explored the molecular mechanisms. Notably, we found that treatment with cordycepin led to inhibition of cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as cellular apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in glioma cell lines in vitro. Likewise, the combined treatment with both cordycepin and TMZ synergistically resulted in inhibition of cellular growth, migration, and tumor metastasis as well as induction of cellular apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, we also demonstrated that cordycepin effectively enhanced the activation of AMPK and suppressed the activity of AKT, whose activation was only induced by TMZ. Furthermore, there was an apparent reduction in the expression levels of p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 in the group treated with both cordycepin and TMZ, in comparison with those in the groups treated with either cordycepin or TMZ alone. In vivo, the combination therapy also obviously reduced the tumor volume as well as prolonged the median survival time of xenograft models. In brief, our results suggested that cordycepin augments TMZ sensitivity in human glioma cells at least partially through activation of AMPK and suppression of the AKT signaling pathway. Overall, the combination therapy of cordycepin and TMZ potentially provides a novel option for a better prognosis of patients with GBM in clinical practice."}

This report describes the feasibility and safety of this regimen. METHODS:Twenty-one patients with unresectable grade 2 NET liver-dominant metastases without contraindications to radioembolization or to CapTem initiated therapy with capecitabine 600 mg/m twice daily for 14 days and temozolomide 150 to 200 mg/m in 2 divided doses on days 10 to 14, with 14 days between cycles. During the first cycle, simulation angiography was performed. The dominant lobe was radioembolized on day 7 of the second cycle. In patients with bilobar disease, the other lobe was treated on day 7 of the third or fourth cycle. RESULTS:Nineteen of 21 patients completed the protocol. Adverse events were as expected. Objective response rate was 74% in the liver and 55% for extrahepatic tumor. Median progression-free survival was not reached. Progression-free survival at 3 years was 67%, with 74% progression-free in the liver. CONCLUSIONS:CapTemY90 is feasible and safe for grade 2 NETs. Toxicities were additive. Oncologic outcomes suggest synergy."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Cutaneous melanomas frequently metastasize to the brain, with temozolomide (TMZ) plus radiotherapy (RT) offering little control of these lesions. We tested whether trehalose, a natural glucose disaccharide proved to induce autophagy, could enhance the effect of TMZ and ionizing radiation (IR). In two melanoma cell lines (A375 and SK-Mel-28), which greatly differ in chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity, trehalose significantly inhibited short-term cell proliferation and also enhanced IR-induced cytostasis. Interestingly, in TMZ-resistant SK-Mel-28 cells, trehalose was more effective than TMZ, and combined trehalose\u2009+\u2009TMZ further reduced cell proliferation. In long-term experiments, colony-forming capacity was dramatically reduced by trehalose, and even more by combined trehalose\u2009+\u2009TMZ or trehalose\u2009+\u2009IR. In resistant SK-Mel-28 cells, although growth was inhibited most with trehalose\u2009+\u2009TMZ\u2009+\u2009IR-6 Gy combined treatment, it is notable that trehalose\u2009+\u2009TMZ treatment was also very effective. Along with a direct antiproliferative effect, two further mechanisms may explain how trehalose potentiates TMZ- and IR-induced effects: the remarkable trehalose-stimulated autophagy in A375 cells, which were sensitive to TMZ- and IR-induced apoptosis; and the notable trehalose-stimulated premature senescence in SK-Mel-28 cells, which were resistant to apoptosis and less prone to autophagy. In normal melanocytes, trehalose induced a minor autophagy and cell proliferation inhibition, without affecting cell viability; moreover, when trehalose was used in combination with TMZ, the slight TMZ-induced cytotoxicity was not significantly reinforced. Together, our results suggest that trehalose, a safe nutrient supplement able to cross the blood-brain barrier, is a promising candidate, worthy to be further explored in vivo, to augment the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ and RT in melanoma brain metastases."}

A retrospective review of 31 patients with glioblastoma treated between 2011 and 2017 who underwent surgical resection or biopsy over radiographic concern for tumor recurrence following RT/TMZ was performed. All patients underwent RSI prior to surgical resection. Diagnostic utility of RSI for tumor recurrence was determined in comparison to histopathology. Analysis of surgical specimens revealed treatment effects in 6/31 patients (19%) and tumor recurrence in 25/31 patients (81%). There was general concordance between the measured RSI signal and histopathologic diagnosis. RSI was negative in 5/6 patients (83%) in patients with histological evidence of treatment effects. RSI was positive in 21/25 patients (84%) in patients with tumor recurrence. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of RSI for glioblastoma recurrence were 84%, 86%, 95%, and 60%, respectively. Histopathologic review showed agreement between the RSI signal and cellularity of the tumor specimen. These data support the use of RSI in the evaluation of treatment effects versus tumor recurrence in glioblastoma patients after RT-TMZ therapy."}

Prior Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis (RTOG-RPA) reports indicate based on pretreatment and treatment-related factors, a subset of patients experience a significantly improved survival. Since the development of the RTOG-RPA, high-grade gliomas have seen the widespread introduction of temozolomide and tumor oncogenetics. Here we aimed to determine whether the RTOG-RPA retained prognostic significance in the context of modern treatment, as well as generate an updated RPA incorporating both clinical and genetic variables. METHODS:Patients with histologically proven glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) between 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. The primary endpoint was overall survival from date of diagnosis. Primary analysis compared actual survival rates to that expected of corresponding RTOG-RPA class. Secondary analysis utilized the rpart function to recursively partition overall survival by numerous clinical and genetic pretreatment and treatment-related variables. A tertiary analysis recursively partitioned a subset of patients in which the status of all genetic markers were known. RESULTS:We identified 878 patients with histologically proven high-grade glioma treated with IMRT and 291 patients in our genetic subset. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 14.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13.1-15.3). Applying the RTOG-RPA to our cohort validated the relative prognostic ordering of the survival classes except class II. Generating our new RPA created 7 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, \u03c7=584) with median survival ranging from 96.4 to 2.9 months based on age, histology, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, radiation fractions, tumor location, radiation dose, temozolomide status, and resection status. Our second RPA of our genetic subset generated 5 significantly different survival classes (P<0.001, \u03c7=166) with survival ranging from 65.3 to 5.6 months based on age, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutation status, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status, neurological functional classification, hospitalization during IMRT, temozolomide status, and Karnofsky performance status. CONCLUSIONS:The RTOG-RPA retains partial prognostic significance, however, should be updated to reflect recent advancements. This series represents a large RPA analyzing both clinical and genetic factors and generated 7 distinct survival classes. Further assessment of patients with fully available genetic markers generated 5 distinct survival classes. These survival classifications need to be validated by a prospective data set and compared against the RTOG-RPA to determine whether they provide improved prognostic power."}

A previous Children's Oncology Group (COG) study (ARST0431) for patients with metastatic RMS produced no improvement in outcome using multiple cytotoxic agents in a dose-intensive manner. The authors report results from the subsequent COG study (ARST08P1), which evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of adding cixutumumab (insulin-like growth factor-1 monoclonal antibody) or temozolomide to the ARST0431 intensive chemotherapy backbone. METHODS:Two nonrandomized pilot studies were conducted in patients with metastatic RMS, initially to determine feasibility, and both pilots were expanded to assess efficacy. All patients received 54 weeks of chemotherapy, including vincristine/irinotecan, interval-compressed vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide/etoposide, and vincristine/dactinomycin/cyclophosphamide. In pilot 1, patients received intravenous cixutumumab (3, 6, or 9 mg/kg) once weekly throughout therapy. In pilot 2, patients received oral temozolomide (100 mg/m2 ) daily for 5 days with irinotecan. All patients received radiation to the primary tumor and to metastatic sites. RESULTS:One hundred sixty-eight eligible patients were enrolled (97 on pilot 1 and 71 on pilot 2). Most patients were aged \u226510 years (73%), with alveolar histology (70%), and had bone and/or bone marrow metastases (59%). Toxicities observed in each pilot were similar to those reported on ARST0431. With a median follow-up of 2.9 years, the 3-year event-free survival rate was 16% (95% confidence interval, 7%-25%) with cixutumumab and 18% (95% confidence interval, 2%-35%) with temozolomide.

GBM exhibits high resistance to the standard treatment consisting of temozolomide (TMZ) combined with radiotherapy. Isofuranodiene (IFD) is a bioactive sesquiterpene occurring in the essential oils obtained from Alexanders (Smyrnium olusatrum L., Apiaceae). This compound has shown a broad spectrum of antitumoral activities in different human cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism of action of IFD on GBM and its potential effects in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, have not been fully elucidated. PURPOSE:The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anticancer effects of IFD itself and in combination with TMZ in GBM. METHODS:Sulforhodamine B-based proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis and Annexin V/PI staining were carried out to determine the IFD effects on three human GBM cell lines, U87, T98, U251 and in normal human astrocyte. Modulation of protein expression levels was determined by western blot analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was evaluated by cytofluorimetry. Moreover, the effects on cell viability of the IFD and TMZ co-administration was evaluated through the calculation of combination index (CI). RESULTS:IFD exerted cytotoxic effects against the GBM cell lines, but not in normal cells (normal human astrocytes). This compound induced a cell cycle blockage and a necrotic cell death depending on the increase of intracellular ROS levels. Furthermore, the synergism between IFD and TMZ was demonstrated in GBM cell lines. CONCLUSION:This study demonstrated the glioma selectivity of IFD and its cytotoxic properties suggesting a new strategy for the treatment of GBM in order to overcome the TMZ resistance and to reduce its side effects."}

Genetically, most glioblastomas do not exhibit the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 gene mutation and rarely harbor the 1p/19q co-deletion. Neuroradiologically, glioblastomas rarely form a cyst with a mural nodule lesion. PATIENT CONCERNS:In this study, a 78-year-old woman, with speech difficulty and forgetfulness, had a cystic tumor with a mural nodule in the right frontoparietal lobe. Therefore, partial tumor resection was performed. DIAGNOSIS:Histopathology of the tumor, a glioblastoma, exhibited pseudopapillary features with non-hyalinized capillary cores and rich mini-gemistocytic cells. Genetic analysis of the tumor revealed co-deletion of 1p36/19q13, with wild-type IDH. INTERVENTIONS:The patient underwent a combination of postoperative radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy before leaving the hospital. After discharge, she was treated by 20 courses of temozolomide chemotherapy. OUTCOMES:The patient is free from tumor recurrence 23 months after the operation. LESSONS:We present a unique case of glioblastoma that exhibited novel neuroradiological, histopathological, and genetic features with a favorable prognosis for the patient. Therefore, a compilation of similar cases with clinicopathological and genetic analyses to characterize this unique glioblastoma is critical. Clinical evidence will help develop effective therapeutic approaches to improve prognosis in patients with glioblastoma."}

The phenotype, number, and composition of lymphocytes were evaluated using flow cytometry. Transcriptional profiles of tumor tissues were analyzed using microarrays. Generation of antitumor immunological memory was investigated upon rechallenge. Results: Combined treatment with anti-PD-1 and TMZ yielded synergistic antitumor efficacy in the presence of donor-originated PD-1+CD8+ T cells in vitro, necessitating in vivo validation. Whereas TMZ did not rescue GBM-implanted mice, anti-PD-1 completely eradicated GBM in 44.4% of mice, and combination of anti-PD-1 and TMZ in all mice. Anti-PD-1 significantly increased the number of tumor-infiltrating lymhpocytes (TILs), and reduced frequencies of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells. However, combining TMZ with anti-PD-1 significantly decreased the number of TILs, which was also observed with TMZ treatment alone. A transcriptome analysis of tumor tissues revealed that anti-PD-1 monotherapy perturbed immune-related genes, distinctly with combined therapy. Upon rechallenge, tumor growth was not observed in mice cured by anti-PD-1 monotherapy, whereas tumors regrew in the combination group. Furthermore, an analysis of peripheral blood revealed that antitumor memory T cells were generated in mice cured by anti-PD-1 monotherapy, not in the combination group. Conclusion: PD-1 blockade induces long-term therapeutic response, and combination with TMZ further enhances antitumor efficacy. However, immunological memory is provoked by anti-PD-1 monotherapy, not by combined therapy."}

We conducted a monocentric prospective study to explore the tolerance and potential efficacy of an early temozolomide cycle after surgery.Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (unmutated IDH1) and of poor prognosis (age>50 years, biopsy or partial resection or unmethylated MGMT promoter) were prospectively included from June 2014 to 2017. They all received a cycle of 5 days of temozolomide between surgery and the combined adjuvant treatment.Twelve patients of median age 64.5 years (45-73) were included in the study. The median doses of temozolomide administered were respectively 265mg (225-300) for the early cycle; 130mg (110-150) for the concomitant treatment and 310mg (225-400) for the adjuvant one. Side effects during treatment were grade III lymphopenia, grade III neutropenia, fatigue and nausea/vomiting respectively in 4, 1, 7 and 5 patients. Progression-free survival and overall survival were respectively 90% and 91.7% at 6 months; 58.3 and 71.3% at 12 months; 31.1 and 71.3% at 18 months.Early postsurgical temozolomide treatment prior to standard adjuvant therapy for poor prognosis glioblastoma patients in our small prospective series presents toxicity and survival similar to those published in the literature for the general population of glioblastoma. These encouraging results should be confirmed by a multicentric study comparing this regiment with the standard treatment."}

Moreover, the same increase was achieved when temozolomide was given to wild-type mice in combination with the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitor elacridar (GF120918). The antitumor efficacy of temozolomide against three different intracranial tumor models was significantly enhanced when Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 were genetically deficient or pharmacologically inhibited in recipient mice.

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) is associated with radiographic pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma. The occurrence of PsP and other treatment effects is less well understood in low-grade gliomas (LGG). The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the addition of TMZ to radiotherapy increases the incidence of PsP in adults with LGG treated with proton radiotherapy (PRT). METHODS:Chart review and volumetric MRI-analysis was performed on radiotherapy-naive adults with WHO grade II or IDH mutant WHO grade III gliomas treated with PRT between 2005 and 2015. Progression was defined by histology, new chemotherapy initiation, or progressive increase in lesion volume beyond 40% from baseline. Post treatment related effects (PTRE) were defined as new/increased T2/FLAIR or abnormal enhancement which eventually resolved or stabilized without evidence of progression for a period of 6-12 months. PsP was defined as the subset of PRTE suspicious for progression or volumetrically increased at least 40% from baseline. Pearson's chi-squared test and Cox-proportional hazards models were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS:There were 119 patients meeting inclusion criteria. There was an increased risk of PsP following PRT\u2009+\u2009TMZ versus PRT-alone (HR\u2009=\u20092.2, p\u2009=\u20090.006, on Cox univariate analysis). Presence of PsP was associated with improved OS (p\u2009=\u20090.02 with PsP as time-varying covariate). CONCLUSIONS:TMZ use, when added to PRT, was associated with increased PsP in patients with LGG; however, patients with PsP tended to achieve longer survival."}

METHODS:We obtained patient data by querying PubMed and Google Scholar with predetermined search terms and inclusion criteria that enabled the identification of relevant case reports. Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analyses. RESULTS:Of 153 patients with scGBM identified through a literature search, 135 met the predetermined search and inclusion criteria.

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly virulent tumor of the central nervous system, with a median survival\u2009<\u200915\u00a0months. Clearly, an improvement in treatment outcomes is needed. However, the emergence of these malignancies within the delicate brain parenchyma and their infiltrative growth pattern severely limit the use of aggressive local therapies. The particle therapy represents a new promising therapeutic approach to circumvent these prohibitive conditions with improved treatment efficacy. METHODS AND DESIGN:Patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas will have their tumor tissue samples submitted for the analysis of the status of O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. In Phase I, the patients will undergo an induction carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) boost followed by 60 GyE of proton irradiation with concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) at 75\u00a0mg/m2. To determine the maximal dose of safe induction boost, the tolerance, and acute toxicity rates in a dose-escalation manner from 9 to 18 GyE in three fractions will be used. In Phase III, GBM-only patients will be randomized to receive either 60 GyE (2\u00a0GyE per fraction) of proton irradiation with concurrent TMZ (control arm) or a CIRT boost (dose determined in Phase I of this trial) followed by 60 GyE of proton irradiation with concurrent TMZ. The primary endpoints are overall survival (OS) and toxicity rates (acute and long-term). Secondary endpoints are progression-free survival (PFS), and tumor response (based upon assessment with C-methionine/fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine positron emission tomography [MET/FET PET] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and detection of serologic immune markers). We hypothesize that the induction CIRT boost will result in a greater initial tumor-killing ability and prime the tumor microenvironment for enhanced immunologic tumor clearance, resulting in an expected 33% improvement in OS rates. DISCUSSION:The prognosis of GBM remains grim. The mechanism underpinning the poor prognosis of this malignancy is its chronic state of tumor hypoxia, which promotes both immunosuppression/immunologic evasion and radio-resistance. The unique physical and biological properties of CIRT are expected to overcome these microenvironmental limitations to confer an improved tumor-killing ability and anti-tumor immune response, which could result in an improvement in OS with minimal toxicity. Trial registration number This trial has been registered with the China Clinical Trials Registry, and was allocated the number ChiCTR-OID-17013702."}

The elderly account for a large proportion of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM), and this population is projected to increase. Their prognosis is inferior to that of GBM patients as a whole, and concerns over treatment toxicity may limit the aggressiveness with which they are treated. Recent clinical studies have assisted with therapeutic decision making in this cohort. Hypofractionated radiation with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide has been shown to increase survival without worsened quality of life in elderly patients with good functional status. Single modality radiation therapy or temozolomide therapy are frequently used in this population, and while neither has demonstrated superiority, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status is predictive of improved survival with temozolomide over radiation therapy. Despite these advances, ambiguity as to how to best define, assess, and treat this population remains.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a JCo berry extract in suppressing glioblastoma growth. METHODS:The effects of JCo extract on the viability of normal and glioma cell lines was analyzed using a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The synergistic therapeutic effect of JCo extract and temozolomide (TMZ) on glioma cells was examined by MTT analysis. Flow cytometry analysis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) test, and western blotting were performed to identify the apoptotic pathway. To determine the in vivo efficacy of the JCo extract, rats were injected with 5 \u00d7 104 rat glioma RG2 cells in the back skin and brain hemisphere and then received a subcutaneous injection in the back skin that contained either JCo extract or vehicle. Finally, blood and histologic examinations were performed to evaluate JCo toxicity. RESULTS:The IC50 values of JCo extract were 57-69 \u00b5g/mL and 49-67 \u00b5g/mL in the glioblastoma cell lines after 24 and 48 h, respectively. However, in non-tumor cell lines, the respective IC50 values of JCo extract were 76-105 \u00b5g/mL and 77-108 \u00b5g/mL. The JCo extract had a stronger cytotoxicity and a larger range of IC50 values in glioma than in normal cells as compared to those effects caused by temozolomide (TMZ). In addition, the results of flow cytometry analysis, TUNEL test, and western blotting revealed that the JCo extract induced glioma cell cycle arrest through intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In the in vivo studies, a significant reduction of tumor size in JCo-treated rats, as measured by animal MRI, demonstrated that the JCo extract effectively inhibited glioma cell growth and successfully penetrated the blood-brain barrier. The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining detected positive signals of PCNA, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR -2 in 44.49%, 5.88%, and 5.85% of JCo-treated glioma cells, respectively. However, positive signals of PCNA, VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 were detected in 73.08%, 9.67%, and 11.70% of vehicle-treated glioma cells, respectively. The IHC examination of PCNA and VEGFR-1 and -2 indicated that JCo extract significantly decreased the degree of neovascularization. However, no significant differences in serum levels of blood cell count and hepatic enzymes, renal function index, and the histologic appearance of vital organs were detected between the JCo and vehicle-treated rats. CONCLUSION:The JCo extract penetrated the blood-brain barrier and significantly induced glioma cell apoptosis by reducing neovascularization via suppression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, JCo extract was less cytotoxic to non-neoplastic vital organs than TMZ."}

Based on the results of our earlier work, which showed a reduction of PD-L1 expression in patients treated with temozolomide (TMZ), we aimed to investigate the link between TMZ therapy and the immune control point target PD-L1. METHODS:RNA-sequencing data from de-novo and recurrent glioblastoma were analyzed by AutoPipe algorithm. Results were confirmed either in a cell model by two primary and one established GBM cell line and specimens of de-novo and recurrent GBM. PD-L1 and pathway activation of the JAK/STAT pathway was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot. RESULTS:We found a significant downregulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and immune response in recurrent tumors. The cell model showed an upregulation of PD-L1 after IFN\u03b3 treatment, while additional TMZ treatment lead to a reduction of PD-L1 expression and JAK/STAT pathway activation. These findings were confirmed in specimens of de-novo and recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that TMZ therapy leads to a down-regulation of PD-L1 in primary GBM cells. These results support the clinical findings where PD-L1 is significantly reduced in recurrent GBMs. If the target is diminished, it may also lead to impaired efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors such as nivolumab."}

Various methods have been developed to increase BBB permeability, but these are associated with adverse effects and are, therefore, not clinically applicable. We recently identified that combination drug treatment of mannitol and temozolomide improved BBB permeability in vitro. Here, we investigated whether this combination could increase the effectiveness of stem cell treatment in an animal model of chronic ischemic stroke.Chronic stroke was induced in rats by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). After then, rats were administered human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) by intravenous injection with or without combination drug treatment of mannitol and temozolomide. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy, behavioral and immunohistochemical tests were performed, and the differences among control, stem cell only, combination drug only and stem cell with combination drug treatment were analyzed.Although no hUC-MSCs were detected in any group, treatment with stem cells and combination drug of mannitol and temozolomide increased the intracerebral delivery of hCD63-positive microvesicles compared with stem cell only treatment. Furthermore, treatment with stem cells and drug combination ameliorated behavioral deficits and increased bromodeoxyuridine-, doublecortin- and Reca-1-positive cells in the perilesional area as compared with other groups.The combination drug treatment of mannitol and temozolomide allowed for the efficient delivery of hUC-MSC-derived microvesicles into the brain in a chronic stroke rat model.

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "The diagnosis of a glioblastoma is mainly made on the basis of their microscopic appearance with the additional determination of epigenetic as well as mutational analyses as deemed appropriate and taken into account in different centers. How far the recent discovery of tumor networks will stimulate novel treatments is a subject of intensive research. A tissue diagnosis is the mainstay. Regardless of age, patients should undergo a maximal safe resection. Magnetic resonance imaging is the surrogate parameter of choice for follow up. Patients should receive chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide with the radiation schedule adapted to performance status, age and tumor location. The use of temozolomide may be reconsidered according to methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status; patients with an active promoter may be subjected to a trial or further molecular work-up in order to potentially replace temozolomide; patients with an inactive (hypermethylated) MGMT promoter may be counseled for the co-treatment with the methylating and alkylating compound lomustine in addition to temozolomide. Tumor-treating fields are an additive option independent of the MGMT status. Determination of recurrence is still challenging. Patients with clinical or radiographic confirmed progression should be counseled for a second surgical intervention, that is, to reach another macroscopic removal of the tumor bulk or to obtain tissue for an updated molecular analysis. Immune therapeutic approaches may be dependent on tumor types and molecular signatures. In newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival without affecting overall survival in an unselected population of glioblastoma patients. Whether or not selection can be made on the basis of molecular or imaging parameters remains to be determined. Some patients may benefit from a second radiotherapy. In our view, the near future will provide support for translating the amazing progress in understanding the molecular background of glioblastoma in to more complex, but promising therapy concepts."}

We assessed the efficacy and safety of iniparib with standard radiotherapy and temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS:Adults meeting eligibility criteria were enrolled in this prospective, single-arm, open-label multi- institution phase II trial with median overall survival (mOS) compared with a historical control as the primary objective. A safety run-in component of radiotherapy + temozolomide + iniparib (n = 5) was followed by an efficacy study (n = 76) with the recommended phase II doses of iniparib (8.0 mg/kg i.v. twice/week with radiotherapy + daily temozolomide followed by 8.6 mg/kg i.v. twice/week with 5/28-day temozolomide). RESULTS:The median age of the 81 evaluable participants was 58 years (63% male). Baseline KPS was \u2265 80% in 87% of participants. The mOS was 22 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 17-24] and the HR was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.35-0.55) per-person-year of follow-up. The 2- and 3-year survival rates were 38% and 25%, respectively. Treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 27% of patients; 9 patients had AEs requiring drug discontinuation including infusion-related reaction, rash, gastritis, increased liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS:Iniparib is well tolerated with radiotherapy and temozolomide in patients with newly diagnosed GBM at up to 17.2 mg/kg weekly. The primary objective of improved mOS compared with a historical control was met, indicating potential antitumor activity of iniparib in this setting.

Therefore, we assessed the use of bevacizumab in patients with first recurrence of grade II or III glioma who did not have 1p/19q co-deletion.The TAVAREC trial was a randomised, open-label phase 2 trial done at 32 centres across Europe in patients with locally diagnosed grade II or III glioma without 1p/19q co-deletion, with a first and contrast-enhancing recurrence after initial radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both. Previous chemotherapy must have been stopped at least 6 months before enrolment and radiotherapy must have been stopped at least 3 months before enrolment. Random group assignment was done electronically through the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer web-based system, stratified by a minimisation procedure using institution, initial histology (WHO grade II vs III), WHO performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), and previous treatment (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both). Patients were assigned to receive either temozolomide (150-200 mg/m2, orally) monotherapy on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of 12 cycles, or the same temozolomide regimen in combination with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg, intravenously) every 2 weeks until progression. The primary endpoint was overall survival at 12 months in the per-protocol population. Safety analyses were done in all patients who started their allocated treatment. The study is registered at EudraCT (2009-017422-39) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01164189), and is complete.Between Feb 8, 2011, and July 31, 2015, 155 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either monotherapy (n=77) or combination therapy (n=78). Overall survival in the per-protocol population at 12 months was achieved by 44 (61% [80% CI 53-69]) of 72 patients in the temozolomide group and 38 (55% [47-69]) of 69 in the combination group. The most frequent toxicity was haematological: 17 (23%) of 75 patients in the monotherapy group and 25 (33%) of 76 in the combination group developed grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity. Other than haematological toxicities, the most common adverse events were nervous system disorders (59 [79%] of 75 patients in the monotherapy group vs 65 [86%] of 76 in the combination group), fatigue (53 [70%] vs 61 [80%]), and nausea (39 [52%] vs 43 [56%]). Infections were more frequently reported in the combination group (29 [38%] of 76 patients) than in the monotherapy group (17 [23%] of 75). One treatment-related death was reported in the combination group (infection after intratumoral haemorrhage during a treatment-related grade 4 thrombocytopenia).We found no evidence of improved overall survival with bevacizumab and temozolomide combination treatment versus temozolomide monotherapy. The findings from this study provide no support for further phase 3 studies on the role of bevacizumab in this disease.Roche Pharmaceuticals."}

We aimed to characterize the role of miR-16-5p as a candidate tumour suppressor miRNA in gliomas. METHODS:Real-time PCR-based approaches were used for miRNA and mRNA expression profiling of glioma and non-neoplastic brain tissues as well as glioma cell lines. Protein levels were determined by Western blotting. In vitro analyses were performed following overexpression of miR-16-5p, trichostatin A (TSA) treatment, and siRNA-mediated knock-down of HDAC3 in glioma cells. Effects of miR-16-5p on glioma cell viability, apoptosis and response to irradiation and temozolomide (TMZ) were assessed. RESULTS:Expression of miR-16-5p was reduced relative to control brain tissue in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant astrocytomas of World Health Organization (WHO) grades II, III and IV, and a subset of IDH-wildtype glioblastomas WHO grade IV. MiR-16-5p expression was lower in IDH-mutant than in IDH-wildtype gliomas, and down-regulated in IDH-wildtype glioma lines. MiR-16-5p overexpression reduced expression of important cell cycle and apoptosis regulators in glioma cells, including CDK6, CDC25A, CCND3, CCNE1, WEE1, CHEK1, BCL2 and MCL1. In line, CDK6, WEE1, CHEK1, BCL2 and MCL1 transcript levels were increased in WHO grade III or IV gliomas. TSA treatment and HDAC3 knockdown in glioma cells induced miR-16-5p up-regulation and reduced expression of its targets. Moreover, miR-16-5p overexpression inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in various glioma cell lines and increased sensitivity of A172 glioma cells to irradiation and TMZ. CONCLUSION:Reduced expression of miR-16-5p contributes to glioma cell proliferation, survival and resistance to cytotoxic therapy."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system and has a very poor prognosis. Currently, patients were treated by resection followed by radiotherapy plus concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. However, many patients are resistant to TMZ-induced DNA damage because of upregulated expression of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). In this study, upregulation of SATB1 and MGMT, and downregulation of SLC22A18 resulted in acquisition of TMZ resistance in GBM U87 cells. Inactivation of special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1 (SATB1) using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) downregulated MGMT expression and upregulated solute carrier family 22 member 18 (SLC22A18) expression in GBM cells. This suggested SATB1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation of the MGMT and SLC22A18 protein levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of malignant glioma specimens demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the levels of MGMT and SATB1, and a negative correlation between the levels of SLC22A18 and SATB1. Importantly, in recurrent, compared with the primary, lesions in 15 paired identical tumors, the SATB1 and MGMT protein levels were increased and the SLC22A18 levels were decreased. Finally, in TMZ-resistant GBM, SATB1 knockdown enhanced TMZ efficacy. Consequently, SATB1 inhibition might be a promising strategy combined with TMZ chemotherapy to treat TMZ-resistant GBM."}

We report a patient with recurrent PCNSL who has been successfully treated with stereotactic brachytherapy (SBT) with iodine-125 seeds plus temozolomide (TMZ). CASE DESCRIPTION:A 51-year-old man who underwent left occipital lobe tumor resection 11 years earlier presented with a 1-month history of right hand weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a recurrent PCNSL, which was confirmed by pathological examination. He was treated with SBT plus TMZ. At 1 month after surgery, a repeat MRI revealed nearly complete disappearance of the lesion. At 13.5 months postsurgery, the patient was neurologically intact except for right homonymous hemianopia, and follow-up MRI did not reveal a recurrent tumor. CONCLUSIONS:To our knowledge, this is the first case of recurrent PCNSL successfully treated with SBT plus TMZ. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the therapeutic impact of this new method."}

Our objective was to evaluate the characteristics and outcome of patients with LG. PATIENTS AND METHODS:We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients diagnosed with secondary LG. At the time of LG diagnosis, the median age of patients was 45 years. The histological grade was IV in 20 patients and II to III in 11 patients. As a first-line of therapy for LG, 22 patients received an oncological treatment: i) BCNU-temozolomide (TMZ) (n=15), ii) other type of chemotherapy (n=7), and iii) no treatment (supportive care) (n=9). RESULTS:Following LG diagnosis, the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 1.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI)=0.9-2.7] and 2.1 months (95%CI=1.3-3), respectively. The univariate analyses showed an improved OS with age of less than 45 years (p<0.001), a prolonged interval from the initial glioma diagnosis (IGD) to LG diagnosis (p=0.003), BCNU-TMZ as the preferred first-line treatment for LG out of the three options (p=0.008), and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) \u226570 (p=0.012). Prolonged interval from IGD to LG diagnosis (HR=5.839) and BCNU-TMZ as the chosen first-line treatment for LG (HR=6.635) remained significant in the multivariate analyses as well. Among the 22 treated patients, the median OS was significantly higher (p=0.008) with the BCNU-TMZ treatment (5.7 months; 95%CI=4.2-7.1), compared to other types of treatment offered (2 months; 95%CI=1.1-2.9). CONCLUSION:The time interval from the IGD to the LG diagnosis is a potential prognostic factor for LG. BCNU-TMZ may be a therapeutic option in the present setting."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Importance:The initial report of NRG Oncology/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0424 demonstrated a 3-year overall survival benefit with the addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy compared with a historical control. However, an important end point of the trial-evaluation of the association between O6-methylgaunine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and survival outcomes-was not previously reported. Objective:To examine the proportion of patients in NRG Oncology/RTOG 0424 with MGMT promoter methylation and its association with survival outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants:Specimens collected were analyzed after trial completion to determine MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/2 status and the association between MGMT status and survival outcomes. A model derived from logistic regression (MGMT-STP27) was used to calculate MGMT promoter methylation status. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards regression model to determine the association of MGMT status with survival outcomes. Patient pretreatment characteristics were included as covariates in multivariable analyses. Main Outcomes and Measures:Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results:Of all 129 eligible patients in NRG Oncology/RTOG 0424, 75 (58.1%) had MGMT status available (median age, 48 years; age range, 20-76 years; 42 [56.0%] male): 57 (76.0%) methylated and 18 (24.0%) unmethylated. A total of 13 unmethylated patients (72.2%) had astrocytoma as opposed to oligoastrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, whereas 23 methylated patients (40.4%) had astrocytoma. On univariate analyses, an unmethylated MGMT promoter was significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.52; 95% CI, 1.64-7.56; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and PFS (HR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.55-6.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The statistical significances were maintained in multimarker multivariable analyses, including IDH1/2 status for both OS (HR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.02-7.14; P\u2009=\u2009.045) and PFS (HR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.19-6.33; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Conclusions and Relevance:In this study, MGMT promoter methylation was an independent prognostic biomarker of high-risk, low-grade glioma treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to validate the prognostic importance of MGMT promoter methylation in patients with grade II glioma treated with combined radiotherapy and temozolomide and highlights its potential prognostic value beyond IDH1/2 mutation status.

Erwinaze at <1 IU/ml reduced temozolomide IC50s by 3.6- to 13-fold (300-1,200 \u03bcM to 40-330 \u03bcM). Seven-week-old SMO/SMO mice treated with Erwinaze (regardless of temozolomide treatment) had better survival 11 weeks post-therapy, compared to those not treated with Erwinaze (81.25% vs. 46.15, p=0.08). Temozolomide-treated mice developed 10% weight loss, impairing survival. All 16 mice treated with temozolomide (regardless of Erwinaze treatment) succumbed by 40-weeks of age, whereas 5/8 animals treated with Erwinaze alone and 2/6 controls survived (p=0.035).Erwinaze enhances cytotoxicity of temozolomide in vitro, and improves survival in SMO/SMO mice, likely by reducing cerebrospinal fluid glutamine.

In vivo studies show that nZn-CuO NPs inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. Further study found that nZn-CuO NPs trigger cell reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

The first-line antiglioma drug temozolomide shows decreasing therapeutic efficacy as treatment progresses. As the integrated stress response (ISR) may be a resistance factor and severe stress might transform the protective effect of the ISR into a damage effect, pharmacological regulation of ISR may be an effective way to sensitize glioma to temozolomide. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of the ISR in regulating the therapeutic effect of temozolomide in the human glioblastoma multiforme cell line U87MG. Cultured U87MG cells were treated with temozolomide and PCR array was used to screen key factors in the response to treatment. Cells were co-treated with temozolomide and the eIF2\u03b1 phosphatase inhibitor salubrinal, and cell apoptosis was measured. Combination treatment with temozolomide and salubrinal had a synergistic effect on cell viability. Salubrinal could upregulate the expression of ATF4, a key factor in the ISR, and enhance temozolomide-induced apoptosis. ATF4 transcriptionally regulated expression of the BH3-ONLY protein NOXA, thus inducing mitochondrial apoptosis. These findings suggest that ISR and ATF4 are involved in the death crosstalk between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria and might be a potential target to enhance the therapeutic effect of temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.

In this study, we show that glioma cells stimulate normal human astrocyte (NHA) into reactive astrocyte (RAS) in a non-contact manner. Additionally, the amount of O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase (MGMT) mRNA in exosomes (EXOs) released by RAS was significantly increased compared with that in non-reactive NHA. Importantly, MGMT-negative glioma cells can take up RAS-EXOs and acquire a temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant phenotype via the translation of exogenous exosomal MGMT mRNA both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings illuminate a novel phenomenon that may be a potent mechanism underlying glioma recurrence in which glioma-associated NHAs protect MGMT-negative glioma cells from TMZ-induced apoptosis by the functional intercellular transfer of exosomal MGMT mRNA."}

Treatment decisions for patients with LGG are directed toward improving upon the natural history while limiting treatment-associated toxiceffects. Recent evidence has documented a utility for adjuvant chemotherapy with procarbazine, CCNU (lomustine), and vincristine (PCV) or temozolomide (TMZ). We sought to determine the comparative utility of PCV and TMZ for patients with LGG, particularly in context of molecular subtype. A literature search of PubMed was conducted to identify studies reporting patient response to PCV, TMZ, or a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT). Eligibility criteria included patients 16 years of age and older, notation of LGG subtype, and report of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment course. Level I, II, and III data were included. Adjuvant therapy with PCV resulted in prolonged PFS and OS in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk LGG. This benefit was accrued most significantly by patients with tumors harboring 1p/19q codeletion and IDH1 mutation. Adjuvant therapy with temozolomide was associated with lower toxicity than therapy with PCV. In patients with LGG with an unfavorable natural history, such as with intact 1p/19q and wild-type IDH1, RT/TMZ plus adjuvant TMZ may be the best option. Patients with biologically favorable high-risk LGG are likely to derive the most benefit from RT and adjuvant PCV."}

To develop a therapeutic strategy that could be effective in these TMZ-refractory gliomas, we first screened 13 DNA damage response modulators for their ability to suppress viability of MSH6-inactivated, TMZ-resistant glioma cells. We identified a PLK1 selective inhibitor, Volasertib, as the most potent in inhibiting proliferation of glioblastoma cells. PLK1 inhibition induced mitotic catastrophe, G2-M cell-cycle arrest, and DNA damage, leading to caspase-mediated apoptosis in glioblastoma cells. Importantly, therapeutic effects of PLK1 inhibitors were not influenced by MSH6 knockdown, indicating that their action is independent of MMR status of the cells. Systemic treatment with Volasertib potently inhibited tumor growth in an MMR-deficient, TMZ-resistant glioblastoma xenograft model. Further in vitro testing in established and patient-derived cell line panels revealed an association of PLK1 inhibitor efficacy with cellular Myc expression status. We found that cells with deregulated Myc are vulnerable to PLK1 inhibition, as Myc overexpression sensitizes, whereas its silencing desensitizes, glioblastoma cells to PLK1 inhibitors. This discovery is clinically relevant as glioma progression post-TMZ treatment is frequently accompanied by MYC genomic amplification and/or pathway activation. In conclusion, PLK inhibitor represents a novel therapeutic option for recurrent gliomas, including those TMZ-resistant from MMR deficiency. Genomic MYC alteration may serve as a biomarker for PLK inhibitor sensitivity, as Myc-driven tumors demonstrated pronounced responses. Mol Cancer Ther; 17(12); 1-13. \u00a92018 AACR."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:In this study, we aimed to evaluate the expression and functions of MAPK8 in temozolomide (TMZ) -resistant glioblastoma cells as well as to explore the mechanism of TMZ resistance in glioblastoma cells. METHODS:Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was used for identifying the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in TMZ resistant samples. The functional partner genes of TMZ were screened out by Gene-drug interaction network (STITCH) and the glioblastoma-related genes were selected by gene search engine with evidence sentences (Digsee). The interactions among identified DEGs and glioblastoma-related genes were detected by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The dysregulated pathways were identified by Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). qRT-PCR was performed to detect the expression level of MAPK8 in glioblastoma cells. Western blot was used to detect the expressions of MAPK8 and MAPK signaling pathway-related proteins. MTT assay was utilized to measure the cell viability of TMZ sensitive and resistant cells. Colony formation assay was performed to detect the clone ability and flow cytometry (FCM) assay was applied to identify the apoptosis rate of TMZ resistant glioblastoma cells. RESULTS:MAPK8 was one of the DEGs and was up-regulated in TMZ resistant glioblastoma cells. The MAPK signaling pathway was activated in TMZ resistant glioblastoma cells under the condition of over-expression of MAPK8. The inhibition of MAPK8 restrained the colony formation, inducing apoptosis of TMZ resistant glioblastoma cells and suppressed the MAPK signaling pathway. CONCLUSION:MAPK8 promoted the resistance to TMZ, accelerated cell proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells via activating MAPK signaling pathway."}

In this study, we focused on a consanguineous Iranian Family with high prevalence of brain tumors in their pedigree and reviewed the literature on MSH6 mutations in brain tumors and the treatment responses focused on Gliomas. METHOD:We chose a family with a high prevalence of brain tumor in their pedigree. We studied the proband's neuroimaging and brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), biopsy result, and whole-genome sequencing. RESULT:The neuroimaging and brain proton MRS reported a lesion in the right frontoparietal. The MRI revealed a large enhancible heterogenous mass in the right temporo-fronto-parieto-occipital lobes with involvement of corpus callosum which was suggestive of glioma. The patient revealed a homozygous pattern for a novel 9 base-pare deletion at the 912-914 codon on exon 4 of the MSH6 gene. DISCUSSION:We discuss several studies on MSH6 mutations in brain tumors and we discuss treatment responses in MSH6 mutations and the studies conducted to sensitize chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance brain tumors to face this subject efficiently. CONCLUSION:Patients should be evaluated for MMR mutation before chemo and radiotherapy, and it is valuable to follow-up these mutations during the treatment too. In temozolomide (TMZ)-resitance cases, it is suggested to use complementary strategies such as using HDACis and a combination of a STAT3 Inhibitor and an mTOR inhibitor, BER inhibition mechanism, and PARP-1 inhibitor."}

Autophagy sustains tumor survival and growth when induced by common cancer treatments, including IR and cytotoxic chemotherapy, thereby contributing to therapeutic resistance of tumors. In this study, we report that the expression of MIR93, noted in two clinically relevant tumor subtypes of GBM, influenced GSC phenotype as well as tumor response to therapy through its effects on autophagy. Our mechanistic studies revealed that MIR93 regulated autophagic activities in GSCs through simultaneous inhibition of multiple autophagy regulators, including BECN1/Beclin 1, ATG5, ATG4B, and SQSTM1/p62. Moreover, two first-line treatments for GBM, IR and temozolomide (TMZ), as well as rapamycin (Rap), the prototypic MTOR inhibitor, decreased MIR93 expression that, in turn, stimulated autophagic processes in GSCs. Inhibition of autophagy by ectopic MIR93 expression, or via autophagy inhibitors NSC (an ATG4B inhibitor) and CQ, enhanced the activity of IR and TMZ against GSCs. Collectively, our findings reveal a key role for MIR93 in the regulation of autophagy and suggest a combination treatment strategy involving the inhibition of autophagy while administering cytotoxic therapy.

As there is not a gold standard treatment for these tumors in this field, we conducted a literature review in order to identify objective criteria for treatment choice. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We critically reviewed and performed a meta-analysis of all published clinical studies of systemic therapies in patients with well-differentiated unresectable PanNETs, selecting only those articles which reported tumor shrinkage (TS) with a waterfall plot (WP). Tumor downsizing of \u226510% was considered as objective response. RESULTS:We selected 17 out of 2758 studies, comprising 1118 patients with tumor response reported as WP. Proliferation index, tumor burden and anti-tumor therapies were heterogeneous. Chemotherapy alone (mainly, capecitabine/temozolomide) or in combination showed the best results, with \u226510% TS ranging from 65% to 93%. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy combined with chemotherapy (Chemo-PRRT) and sunitinib appeared promising by inducing objective response in a significant proportion of patients (93% and 60%, respectively). Time to tumor response was reported in only two trials. No clear clinical and/or biological predictive factors emerged. CONCLUSION:Based on response criteria used in our retrospective analysis, systemic chemotherapy alone or in combination appeared to have the main cytoreductive impact. However no conclusions regarding either a specific regimen or combination can be drawn. Furthermore, tumor population selection and/or choice of regimen may have a significant influence. Further analysis should be also conducted to identify potential predictive biomarkers of responses, in order to design future prospective interventional clinical trials enrolling more homogenous populations of advanced well-differentiated PanNETs."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "Monofunctional alkylating agents preferentially react at the N7 position of 2'-deoxyguanosine in duplex DNA. Methylated DNA, such as that produced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and temozolomide, exists for days in organisms. The predominant consequence of N7-methyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (MdG) is widely believed to be abasic site (AP) formation via hydrolysis, a process that is slow in free DNA. Examination of MdG reactivity within nucleosome core particles (NCPs) provided two general observations. MdG depurination rate constants are reduced in NCPs compared with when the identical DNA sequence is free in solution. The magnitude of the decrease correlates with proximity to the positively charged histone tails, and experiments in NCPs containing histone variants reveal that positively charged amino acids are responsible for the decreased rate of abasic site formation from MdG. In addition, the lysine-rich histone tails form DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) with MdG. Cross-link formation is reversible and is ascribed to nucleophilic attack at the C8 position of MdG. DPC and retarded abasic site formation are observed in NCPs randomly damaged by MMS, indicating that these are general processes. Histone-MdG cross-links were also detected by mass spectrometry in chromatin isolated from V79 Chinese hamster lung cells treated with MMS. The formation of DPCs following damage by a monofunctional alkylating agent has not been reported previously. These observations reveal the possibility that such DPCs may contribute to the cytotoxicity of monofunctional alkylating agents, such as MMS, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, and temozolomide."}
{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "The ATP binding cassette (ABC) E1 (ABCE1), a member of the ABC family, was originally described as the RNase L inhibitor. Through forming a heterodimer with RNase L, ABCE1 participates in the negative regulation of the 2-5A/RNase L system and thus mediates a wide range of biological functions. Recent evidence has shown the new roles of ABCE1 in tumorigenesis. However, there have been no investigations on the specific effect of ABCE1 on glioma. In the present study, we examined the expression pattern and possible role of ABCE1 in glioma. Our study demonstrated that ABCE1 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Down-regulation of ABCE1 inhibited temozolomide (TMZ) resistance of glioma cells in vitro and in vivo In addition, we found that the PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB pathway was involved in ABCE1-mediated chemoresistance of glioma cells. Taken together, our study suggested ABCE1 as a promising target for glioma chemotherapy."}

Case:A 35-year-old woman presented with an aggressive ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma that initially responded to concurrent temozolomide and capecitabine prior to metastasizing to the liver. Following treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab, the tumor volume of the dominant liver metastasis reduced by 92%, and the recurrent intracranial disease regressed by 59%. Simultaneously, her plasma ACTH level decreased from 45,550 pg/mL to 66 pg/mL. Molecular Evaluation:Both prospective clinical sequencing with Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets and retrospective whole-exome sequencing were performed to characterize the molecular alterations in the chemotherapy-naive pituitary adenoma and the temozolomide-resistant liver metastasis. The liver metastasis harbored a somatic mutational burden consistent with alkylator-induced hypermutation that was absent from the treatment-naive tumor. Resistance to temozolomide treatment, acquisition of new oncogenic drivers, and subsequent sensitivity to immunotherapy may be attributed to hypermutation. Conclusion:Combination treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab may be an effective treatment in pituitary carcinoma. Clinical sequencing of pituitary tumors that have relapsed following treatment with conventional chemotherapy may identify the development of therapy-induced somatic hypermutation, which may be associated with treatment response to immunotherapy."}

Several mechanisms are involved in drug and radiation resistance to anticancer treatments and among them one of the most important factors is the tumor microenvironment status, characterized by cancer cell hypersecretion of interleukins and cytokines. The aim of our research was the synthesis of a nanocarrier of quercetin combined with temozolomide, to enhance the specificity and efficacy of this anticancer drug commonly used in glioblastoma treatment. The nanohydrogel increased the internalization and cytotoxicity of quercetin in human glioblastoma cells and, when co-delivered with temozolomide, contribute to an improved anticancer effect. The nanohydrogel loaded with quercetin had the ability to recognize CD44 receptor, a brain cancer cell marker, through an energy and caveolae dependent mechanism of internalization. Moreover, nanohydrogel of quercetin was able to reduce significantly IL-8, IL-6, and VEGF production in pro-inflammatory conditions with interesting implications on the mechanism of glioblastoma cells drug resistance. In summary, novel CD44 targeted polymeric based nanocarriers appear to be proficient in mediating site-specific delivery of quercetin via CD44 receptor in glioblastoma cells. This targeted therapy lead to an improved therapeutic efficacy of temozolomide by modulating the brain tumor microenvironment."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and fatal human brain tumor, with the worst prognosis. The aberrant microenvironment, enhanced by the activation of proangiogenic mediators such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and their downstream effectors, sustain GBM malignancy. Proangiogenic signaling represents an attractive chemotherapeutic target. Recent evidence suggests a therapeutic benefit from aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA) intake in reducing risk and cancer progression. METHODS:In the present study, human primary GBM-endothelial cells (ECs) were used to ascertain whether ASA could inhibit angiogenesis and improve cell sensitivity to drugs. The impact of ASA was observed by measuring cell viability, tube-like structure formation, migration, VEGF production, and proliferative, proangiogenic, and apoptotic modulators expression, such as HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor/(VEGFR)-1/VEGFR-2, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling axis, and Bcl-2-associated X protein/B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) ratio. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of ASA alone or in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), bevacizumab (BEV), and sunitinib (SUN). RESULTS:Our data reported that ASA affected GBM-EC viability, tube-like structure formation, cell migration, and VEGF releasing in a dose-dependent manner and that combined treatments with TMZ, BEV, and SUN synergized to counteract proangiogenic cell ability. mRNA expression analysis displayed a marked effect of ASA in reducing VEGF, VEGFR-1, HIF-1\u03b1, RAS, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, AKT, and BCL-2, as well a combined anticancer effect of ASA together with TMZ, BEV, and SUN. Levels of HIF-1\u03b1, VEGFR-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein, and BCL-2 protein expression confirmed a positive trend. CONCLUSIONS:ASA and antiangiogenic therapies showed synergetic anticancer efficacy in human primary GBM-ECs. Thus, the combination of conventional chemotherapy with ASA may offer a new strategy to counteract tumor malignancy."}

Our goal is to develop VCN for potential clinical translation as an anti-cancer agent. VCN is a peptide of 69 amino acids with a single tyrosine residue. We have employed VCN as integrin-targeted radionuclide therapy (brachytherapy) for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM, glioma). GBM is a deadly brain cancer that doesn't discriminate between sexes and knows no age limit. We established that the tyrosine residue in VCN can be radioiodinated with full retention of bioactivity. 131I-VCN was utilized for integrin-targeted radionuclide therapy using mouse models of glioma. The combination of radioiodinated VCN plus temozolomide (a DNA alkylating agent) significantly prolonged survival of glioma-bearing mice. We also obtained similar results using an immunocompetent mouse model and a murine glioma cell line. In summary, as demonstrated in studies reported here we have shown that VCN as targeted radionuclide therapy for GBM has significant translational potential for therapy of this deadly disease."}

{"keyword": "temozolomide", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is usually characterized by diffuse, infiltrative growth and local tumor progression. Extensive leptomeningeal metastases are rarely observed. It is unclear which GBMs are prone to this specific growth pattern and progression, and standardized salvage treatment protocols are unavailable. CASE DESCRIPTION:In a 45-year-old man without focal neurologic deficit, a right temporal GBM, IDH-wildtype (biomarkers MGMT promoter methylation negative, Ki-67 proliferation rate 70%) was diagnosed. Gross tumor resection followed by concomitant and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide was performed. Routine follow-up imaging 8 months later showed a right parietal meningeal tumor. Resection confirmed a distant GBM, and next-generation sequencing revealed high tumor mutational burden, high-frequency microsatellite instability, and a pharmacologically targetable KIT mutation. Complete neuraxis imaging revealed multiple contrast-enhancing tumors in the craniocervical junction and levels C7, Th8-Th11, and S1. The craniocervical tumors and the cervical spine from C1-C2 were irradiated as palliative care, and second-line combined chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy with irinotecan and bevacizumab was initiated, which was later changed to an immune-checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab owing to tumor progression. Tumor growth was slowed, but the patient eventually developed a progressive paraparesis. Subsequent KIT-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with imatinib was administered for a short time. The patient died 13.8 months after initial diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:High-risk genetic profiles for GBMs prone to develop extensive leptomeningeal metastases need to be identified. Guidelines on preemptive, complete neuraxis imaging in certain patients with GBM as well as treatment guidelines need to be developed."}

The microparticles were prepared by emulsion solvent evaporation method (O1/O2). Disc formulations were prepared by direct compression technique from microparticles. In the current study, gastric-mucoadhesive microparticles with different polymers ratios (CP:EC) were prepared and were characterized by encapsulation efficiency, particle size, flowability, mucoadhesive property and drug release studies. The best polymers ratio was 1:3 (F2) with Carbomer 934p (as mucoadhesive polymer) and ethylcellulose (as retardant polymer), respectively. The production yield microparticles F2 showed 98.80%, mean particle size 933.25 \u00b5m and loading efficiency %98.44. The results were found that microparticle discs prepared had slower release than microparticles (p > o.o5). The microparticles exhibited very good percentage of mucoadhesion and flowability properties. The release of drug was prolonged to 8 h (71.65-82.22%) when incorporated into mucoadhesive microparticles. The poor bioavailability of metformine is attributed to short retention of its dosage form at the absorption sites (in upper gastrointestinal tract). The results of mucoadhesion study showed better retention of metformine microparticles (8 h) in duodenal and jejunum regions of intestine (F1, 1:2 ratio of CP:EC).

MF is reported to be absorbed mainly in upper part of GIT. It is having narrow absorption window and high water solubility, and it would be more beneficial to retain the drug in stomach for prolonged duration so as to achieve maximum absorption and better bioavailability. A conventional oral CR formulation releases most of the drug content at the colon, which requires that the drug will be absorbed from the colon. The present investigation is aimed to develop novel gastroretentive (GR) drug delivery system, which not only release the drug in the absorption window but also provides controlled release drug profile that may result patient compliance and therapeutic success. Floating tablets of MF was prepared using sodium alginate, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose was used as a gelling agent, and release modifiers, respectively. Eudragit NE 30 D was used as sustained release polymer to control the initial burst release. Drug and excipients compatibility studies were monitored by thermal analysis by using differential scanning calorimeter. 32 full factorial design was applied to optimize the formulation. The DSC thermogram of drug, polymer and physical mixtures revealed that there was no known interaction between drug and polymers. The prepared tablets were evaluated for in vitro dissolution, in vitro buoyancy, percentage swelling, percentage erosion and similarity factors with marketed tablets. The optimization study using a 32 full factorial design revealed that the amount of sodium alginate and sodium carboxymethylcellulose had a significant effect on t50, t90, Flag and f2. Thus, by selecting a suitable composition of release rate modifier and gel forming agent, Gastro retentive system can be developed with the desired dissolution profile. This study indicated that the MF GR tablets prepared using sodium alginate and sodium carboxymethylcellulose can successfully be employed as a once-a-day oral controlled release drug delivery system."}

Both ferrochelatase (FECH/Fech) and aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1/Alas1) are crucial enzymes in regulating heme biosynthesis. Isoniazid has recently been reported to upregulate Alas1 but downregulate Fech protein levels in mice; however, the mechanism by which isoniazid mediates disruption of heme synthesis has been unclear. Two metabolites of isoniazid, pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH, the isoniazid-vitamin B6 conjugate) and hydrazine, have been detected in the urine of humans treated with isoniazid. Here we show that, in primary human hepatocytes and the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2/C3A, (1) isoniazid treatment increases Alas1 protein levels but decreases Fech levels; (2) hydrazine treatment upregulates Alas1 protein and Alas1 mRNA levels; (3) PIH treatment decreases Fech protein levels, but not Fech mRNA levels; and (4) PIH is detected after isoniazid treatment, with levels increasing further when exogenous vitamin B6 analogs are coadministered. In addition, the PIH-mediated downregulation of human FECH is associated with iron chelation. Together, these data demonstrate that hydrazine upregulates ALAS1, whereas PIH downregulates FECH, suggesting that the metabolites of isoniazid mediate its disruption of heme biosynthesis by contributing to protoporphyrin IX accumulation."}

Breast-feeding is not contra-indicated while undergoing isoniazid therapy, even though isoniazid was found to migrate into breast milk, leading to infant drug exposure. Exposure assessment of isoniazid in infants exposed to the drug via breast milk has so far not accounted for the polymorphic expression of the isoniazid metabolising enzyme N-acetyltransferase 2. The aim of this study was to re-visit the safety assessment of maternal isoniazid therapy for infants exposed to the drug via breast milk, while accounting for fast and slow metabolisers in the adult and infant population, as well as for slower metabolism in small infants than in adults. We applied a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling approach to estimate mother and infant external and internal drug exposure non-invasively. Validity of our PBPK models was confirmed through comparison of simulated results with experimental data. Highest recommended oral doses for mothers are daily 300 mg or 900 mg every 3 days. Simulation of maternal intake of 300 mg resulted in oral exposures of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.42-0.69) mg/day and 1.49 (1.22-1.50) mg/day for infants of fast and slow metabolising mothers, respectively. Oral exposures of infants within the first 24 h after maternal intake of 900 mg were 1.75 (1.25-2.06) mg/day and 4.46 (4.00-4.50) mg/day. Maximal drug concentrations in infant plasma ranged between 0.04 and 0.78 mg/L for the two dosing regimens. We therefore conclude that infant exposure to isoniazid via breast milk after maternal drug intake of highest recommended doses is very low. We expect that such low exposure levels most likely do not cause any clinically significant adverse effects in nursed infants."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Objectives:To describe the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid and acetyl-isoniazid in TB/HIV-coinfected patients, and assess the effects of efavirenz co-administration and a 50% increase in the dose of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic parameters of isoniazid and acetyl-isoniazid. Methods:TB/HIV-coinfected patients participating in the three-treatment-arm RAFA randomized controlled trial conducted in West Africa were recruited into the pharmacokinetics sub-study. Five serial blood samples were collected on a single visit between 4 and 8\u2009weeks after initiation of antituberculosis treatment. Concentration-time data for isoniazid and acetyl-isoniazid were analysed using non-linear mixed-effects models. Results:Isoniazid concentrations from 150 patients were available for analysis, and 79 of these (53%) also had concentrations of acetyl-isoniazid. Isoniazid pharmacokinetics was best described with a two-compartment disposition model with lagged first-order absorption and elimination using a semi-mechanistic model describing hepatic extraction. The model identified two elimination pathways, separating formation of acetyl-isoniazid from other routes of metabolism. The predicted AUC0-24 is reduced by 29% in patients who are fast acetylators of isoniazid and receiving efavirenz-based ART (6.73 versus 4.68\u2009mg\u00b7h/L). In slow acetylators, efavirenz-based ART had no effect on isoniazid exposure (AUC0-24\u2009=\u200917.5\u2009mg\u00b7h/L). Conclusions:Efavirenz-based ART affects the acetylation metabolic pathway amongst rapid acetylators, resulting in reduced exposure to isoniazid. Pharmacokinetics of isoniazid and acetyl-isoniazid were not influenced by the 50% increase in rifampicin dose."}
{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Isoniazid (INH) was the first synthesized drug that mediated bactericidal killing of the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major clinical breakthrough. To this day, INH remains a cornerstone of modern tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy. This review describes the serendipitous discovery of INH, its effectiveness on TB patients, as well as early studies to discover its mechanisms of bacteriocidal activity. Forty years after its introduction as a TB drug, the development of gene transfer in mycobacteria enabled the discovery of the genes encoding INH resistance, namely the activator (katG) and the target (inhA) of INH. Further biochemical and X-ray crystallography studies on KatG and InhA proteins and mutants provided comprehensive understanding of INH mode of action and resistance mechanisms. Bacterial cultures can harbor subpopulations that are genetically or phenotypically resistant cells, the latter known as persisters. Treatment of exponentially growing cultures of M. tuberculosis with INH reproducibly kills 99 to 99.9% of cells in three days. Importantly, the surviving cells are slowly replicating or non-replicating cells expressing a unique stress response signature: these are the persisters. These persisters can be visualized using dual-reporter mycobacteriophages and their formation prevented using reducing compounds, such as N-acetylcysteine or vitamin C, that enhance M. tuberculosis' respiration. Altogether, this review portrays a detailed molecular analysis of INH killing and resistance mechanisms including persistence. The phenomenon of persistence is clearly the single greatest impediment to TB control, and research aimed at understanding persistence will provide new strategies to improve TB chemotherapy."}

This study attempted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid and rifampicin, when used in children, and to optimize their dosing regimens. METHODS:Data were collected from 41 children, aged 2-16\u00a0years, who were being treated with antituberculosis drugs for at least 2\u00a0months. Concentration measurements were done for 6\u00a0h and analysed using a nonlinear, mixed-effects model. RESULTS:Isoniazid pharmacokinetics were described by a one-compartment disposition model with a transit absorption model (fixed, n =\u00a05). A mixture model was used to identify the slow and fast acetylator subgroups. Rifampicin was described by a one-compartment disposition model with a transit absorption model (fixed, n =\u00a09). Body weight was added to the clearance and volume of distribution of both the drugs using an allometric function. Simulations with the isoniazid model showed that 84.9% of the population achieved therapeutic peak serum concentration with the planned fixed-dose combination regimen. Simulations with the rifampicin model showed that only about 28.8% of the simulated population achieve the therapeutic peak serum concentration with the fixed-dose combination regimen. A novel regimen for rifampicin, with an average dose of 35\u00a0mg\u00a0kg-1 , was found to provide adequate drug exposure in most children. CONCLUSIONS:The exposure to isoniazid is adequate with present regimens. For rifampicin, a novel dosing regimen was developed to ensure adequate drug concentrations in children. However, further studies are required to assess the dose-effect relationship of higher doses of rifampicin."}

However, initiation and maintenance of this treatment is poor in many areas. This review summarises the existing literature on barriers to implementation of isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis in children in endemic settings. MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were used to search for primary research studies published between 1998 and 2018, specifically mentioning isoniazid preventive therapy, tuberculosis and children. Barriers identified in most study settings included absence of parental risk perception, health-care worker knowledge gaps and treatment access. Focusing on patient-centred care, enhancing community and health-care worker education and securing stable medication supply to effectively deliver this therapy is crucial in order to reduce childhood morbidity and mortality from tuberculosis."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Isoniazid is a drug that is widely used against tuberculosis. However, it shows high interpatient variability in metabolism kinetics and clinical effect, which complicates the prescription of the medication and jeopardizes the success of the therapy. Therefore, in a specific patient, the pharmacokinetics of the drug must be elucidated to decide the proper dosage and intake frequency to make the drug suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring. This can be performed by the quantification of the drug in urine as this process is non-invasive and allows the effects of long-time exposure to be inferred. The paper describes the development of a micellar liquid chromatographic method to quantify isoniazid in urine samples. Extraction steps were avoided, making the procedure easy to handle and reducing the waste of toxic organic solvents. Isoniazid was eluted in less than 5 min without interference from other compounds of the urine using a mobile phase containing 0.15 SDS\u207b12.5% 1-propanol (v/v)\u207bNa\u2082HPO\u2084 0.01 M buffered at pH 7, running at 1 mL/min under isocratic mode through a C18 column with the detection wavelength at 265 nm. The method was validated by following the requirements of the Guidelines on Bioanalytical Method Validation issued by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in terms of selectivity, calibration curve (r\u00b2 = 0.9998 in the calibration range (0.03\u207b10.0 \u03bcg/mL), limit of detection and quantification (10 and 30 ng/mL respectively), precision (<16.0%), accuracy (-0.9 to +8.5%), carry-over, matrix effect, and robustness. The developed method was applied to quantify isoniazid in urine samples of patients of an Indian hospital with good results. The method was found to be useful for routine analysis to check the amount of isoniazid in these patients and could be used in its therapeutic monitoring."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "The failure of drugs for effective treatment against infectious diseases can be attributed to resistant forms of causative agents. The evasive nature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is partly associated to its physical features, such as having a thick cell wall and incorporation of beneficial mutations leading to drug resistance. The pro drug Isoniazid (INH) interacts with an enzyme catalase peroxidase to get converted into its active form and upon activation stops the cell wall synthesis thus killing the Mycobacterium. The most common mutation i.e. S315T leads to high degree of drug resistance by virtue of its position in the active site. Here, we have characterized the prominent attributes of two double mutant isolates S315\u202fT/D194G and S315T/M624V which are multi drug resistant and extremely drug resistant, respectively. Protein models were generated using the crystal structure which were then subjected to energy minimization and long term molecular dynamics simulations. Further, computational analysis showed decreasing ability of INH binding to the mutants in order of: Native\u202f>\u202fS315T/D194G\u202f>\u202fS315T/M624V. Also, a trend was observed that as the docking score and binding area decreased, there was a significant increase in the distortion of the 3D geometry of the mutants as observed by PCA analysis."}

Methods: Eighty Wistar rats were randomly divided into control group (8 rats) and model group (72 rats). After 10 days of intragastric administration of isoniazid, the model group rats were randomly divided into treatment group (A), natural recovery group (B), etiological persistence group (C) and etiological persistence plus treatment group (D). Sixteen rats from each group were sacrificed after 1 and 2 weeks of intervention with different methods. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected. Liver pathological morphology was observed. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL assay. ERS protein expression was detected by Western blot. A t-test or randomized block analysis of variance, K-S test and Levene's test were used to analyze the normality and homogeneity of variance. Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used for data that did not suit the conditions of t-test and variance analysis. Results: ALT and AST were elevated in the model group, and liver pathological examination showed liver tissue damage. Apoptotic index was higher than control group (7.13% \u00b1 1.55% vs. 0.75% \u00b1 0.71%, Z = -3.411, P < 0.01), and the expression value of ERS protein in model group was significantly higher than control group (GRP78: 1.16 \u00b1 0.30 vs. 0.23 \u00b1 0.05, t = -6.008, P < 0.01; CHOP: 0.98\u00b10.23 vs. 0.20 \u00b1 0.10, t = -6.378, P < 0.01). Serum enzymes, apoptotic index and ERS protein expressions of rats were decreased after treatment with bicyclol, and the pathological damage was eased. Rats in natural recovery group recovered less than the treatment group. Conclusion: Isoniazid-induced liver injury is associated to ERS-related excessive apoptosis and the therapeutic effect of bicyclol on drug-induced liver injury may minimize ERS-induced apoptosis."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Introduction:Isoniazid-induced seizure, often described as Status Epilepticus (SE), is an emergency condition characterized by repeated convulsive episodes that responds poorly to the currently available anticonvulsant drugs. The current study aimed at ascertaining the effect of Jobelyn\u00ae (JB), an African dietary supplement, on seizures, altered oxidative stress, and glutamate decarboxylase activity induced by isoniazid in mice. Methods:A total of 6 mice received JB (10-50 mg/kg, PO), pyridoxine (300 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg), or distilled water (10 mL/kg) 30 minutes prior to the induction of SE with injection of isoniazid (300 mg/kg, IP). Thereafter, the mice were observed for the onset of convulsions for a period of two hours. Moreover, the effect of JB on Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD) activity and biomarkers of oxidative stress (glutathione and malondialdehyde) was also evaluated in the brain homogenates of another set of isoniazid-treated mice. Results:JB (50 mg/kg, PO) prolonged the latency to convulsions, but could not prevent the occurrence of seizure episodes caused by isoniazid. Moreover, JB neither showed any protection against death nor delayed the latency to death caused by isoniazid. However, this dose of JB positively modulated the concentrations of malondialdehyde and glutathione in the brains of mice treated with isoniazid. The activity of GAD, the enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis, increased by JB, which suggested enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission. Conclusion:The current study findings suggest that JB prolongs the latency to convulsions, enhances GABAergic neurotransmission, and demonstrates anti-oxidative effect in isoniazid-treated mice."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is commonly resistant to various drugs. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-MTB) is mostly caused by mutation in drug-binding proteins and protein folding. The aim of the study was to identify the pattern of mutations in embC, inhA and rpoB proteins and investigate its interactions with available drug such as rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid, using a computer docking method. The evolution of drugs resistant mechanisms of MTB was analyzed using an in silico approach. The model proteins were considered to be in a protein-protein interaction network among the twenty transmembrane proteins. The changes in structural conformation may describe the significance of the proton pumps system. The docking analysis revealed that unlike isoniazid, both rifampicin and ethambutol, bound to the same residues in mutant and wild forms. Moreover, multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) showed mutational hotspot regions where the substitution of amino acids in these three target proteins was position specific under stress. The molecular basis of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis can be represented by a protein network which is a well-regulated system for efflux pump activation by popularly used drugs. Ethambutol and rifampicin form stable complexes with EmbC and RpoB, respectively. Isoniazid shows no binding affinity to mutant InhA (2015). Analysis of the cellular network associated with drug regulatory proteins suggest that mmpl3, Rv1634 and Rv1258c play a major role by altering the protein pump to remove the active drug compounds from the bacterial cell."}

We aimed to determine the protective effects of lutein on oxidative optic neuropathy induced by ethambutol and isoniazid in an experimental model. MATERIAL AND METHOD:Totally 24 albino Wistar male rats were assigned into 4 groups, with 6 rats in each group as follows: healthy controls (HC group), 50\u2009mg/kg ethambutol +50\u2009mg/kg isoniazid administered group (EI), 0.5\u2009mg/kg lutein +50\u2009mg/kg ethambutol +50\u2009mg/kg isoniazid administered group (LEI-05) and only Lutein (0.5\u2009mg/kg) (LUT group) administered group. From the blood samples and tissues obtained from the rats, Malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione (GSH), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels were studied. Histopathological evaluations were performed at the end of the study. RESULTS:Serum and tissue IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and MDA levels were the highest in EI group which were significantly lower in lutein administered group. On the other hand, serum and tissue total GSH levels were the lowest in EI group which were significantly higher in Lutein administered group. In histopathological evaluations, there were significant differences between EI group and all other three groups with edema and hemorrhage in connective tissue covering optic nerve, dilated and congested capillary, decrease in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. CONCLUSION:Isoniazid and ethambutol induced toxic optic neuropathy although not common, may have some potential devastating effects on vision.

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Isoniazid-resistant, rifampin susceptible tuberculosis (INHR-TB) is the most common form of drug resistant TB globally. Treatment of INHR-TB with standard first-line therapy is associated with high rates of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). We modelled the potential impact of INHR-TB detection and appropriate treatment on MDR-TB prevalence. METHODS:A decision analysis model was developed to compare three different strategies for the detection of TB (AFB smear, Xpert MTB/RIF, and Line-Probe Assays (LPA)), combined with appropriate treatment. The population evaluated were patients with a globally representative prevalence of newly diagnosed, drug-susceptible (88.6%), isoniazid-resistant (7.3%), and multidrug resistant (4.1%) pulmonary TB. Our primary outcome was the proportion of patients with MDR-TB after initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment within a 2-year period. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of i) individuals with detected TB who acquired MDR-TB ii) individuals who died after initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS:After initial attempt at diagnosis and treatment, LPA combined with appropriate INHR-TB therapy resulted in a lower proportion of prevalent MDR-TB (1.61%; 95% Uncertainty Range (UR: 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles generated from 10 000 Monte Carlo simulation trials) 1.61-1.65), when compared to Xpert (1.84%; 95% UR 1.82-1.85) and AFB smear (3.21%; 95% UR 3.19-3.26). LPA also resulted in fewer cases of acquired MDR-TB in those with detected TB (0.35%; 95% UR 0.34-0.35), when compared to Xpert (0.67%; 95% UR 0.65-0.67) and AFB smear (0.68%; 95% UR 0.67-0.69). The majority of acquired MDR-TB arose from the treatment of INHR-TB in all strategies. Xpert-based strategies resulted in a lower proportion of death (2.89%; 95% UR 2.87-2.90) compared to LPA (2.93%; 95% UR 2.91-2.94) and AFB smear (3.21%; 95% UR 3.19-3.23). CONCLUSION:Accurate diagnosis and tailored treatment of INHR-TB with LPA led to an almost 50% relative decrease in acquired MDR-TB when compared with an Xpert MTB/RIF strategy. Continued reliance on diagnostic and treatment protocols that ignore INHR-TB will likely result in further generation of MDR-TB."}

Conventional drugs used in the treatment of liver disease are often in-adequate and a search for supplementation or alternative drugs for the treatment of hepatic damage is indispensible. Therefore our study aims to investigate the hepatoprotective poten-tial of Vernonia Amygdalina Del (bitter leaf) extract against Isoniazid- induced liver injury in Swiss Albino Mice. Treatment of Mice orally with Vernonia Amygdalina Del extract at dose of 250mg/kg and 375 mg/kg significantly lowered (P<0.05) the serum level of liver enzymes in Isoniazid pretreated mice. The hepatoptotective activity of the extract found to be compa-rable with the standard drug, Silymarin (100 mg/kg, P.o.). Moreover, treatment with the ex-tract significantly alleviated Isoniazid induced hepatic injury as supported by the photomi-crographs of liver section of mice. The data shows aqueous Vernonia Amygdalina Del extract has a very promising hepatoprotective potential against isoniazid- induced liver injury."}

The aim of the current study is to investigate the ability of INH to induce monocyte differentiation and the underlying signaling pathway involved in this phenomenon using HL-60\u202fcells. In this study, HL-60\u202fcells were treated with different non-cytotoxic concentrations of INH or vitamin D (a well-known inducer of monocytic differentiation) to determine key functional changes in the phenotype of these cells using several biochemical and cytobiological experiments. HL-60\u202fcells are derived from human promyelocytic leukemia and bear some resemblance to promyelocytes, which differentiate into various cell types. INH-induced differentiation was confirmed to occur in a concentration-dependent manner through several functional markers such as nonspecific esterase activity, NADPH oxidase activity and expression of surface markers CD14 and CD16 (characteristic of monocytes). INH-induced monocytic-like differentiation in HL-60\u202fcells and demonstrated that at least 25% of cells were differentiated within the range of the pharmacological concentrations of INH. To determine the effects of INH on HL-60\u202fcells, we applied quantitative proteomics that revealed 32 proteins were altered significantly in pathways that could involve differentiation signals. Lastly, INH activated the ERK-1/MAPK signaling pathway based on detection of phosphorylated ERK-1. These in vitro findings in HL-60\u202fcells warrant further study using promyelocytes or hematopoietic stem cells to evaluate the physiological capability of INH to induce monocytic differentiation that may aid in host defense against TB."}

Of particular importance is bedaquiline (Sirturo), which kills mycobacteria by inhibiting the F1F0 ATP synthase. Other components of the electron transport chain such as the NADH dehydrogenases (NDH-2 and NdhA) and the terminal respiratory oxidase bc 1:aa 3 are also susceptible to chemical inhibition. Because antituberculosis drugs are prescribed as part of combination therapies, the interaction between novel drugs targeting energy metabolism and classical first and second line antibiotics must be considered to maximize treatment efficiency. Here, we show that subinhibitory concentration of drugs targeting the F1F0 ATP synthase and the cytochrome bc 1:aa 3, as well as energy uncouplers, interfere with the bactericidal potency of isoniazid and moxifloxacin. Isoniazid- and moxifloxacin-induced mycobacterial death correlated with a transient increase in intracellular ATP that was dissipated by co-incubation with energy metabolism inhibitors. Although oxidative phosphorylation is a promising target space for drug development, a better understanding of the link between energy metabolism and antibiotic-induced mycobacterial death is essential to develop potent drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis."}

Thus, in order to gain insights on the interaction of INH with the individual active site residues (Res) of katG, this study presents a computational approach via molecular docking and density functional theory (DFT) using augmented models to study the individual INH-Res interactions. Seven amino acid residues directly interacts with INH: Arg104, Asp137, His108, Ile228, Trp107, Tyr229, and Val230. The residues with the highest interaction energies are Arg104 (-39.64\u202fkcal/mol) and Asp137 (-32.85\u202fkcal/mol) mainly due to strong ion-dipole and H-bonding interactions present in the complexes, while the weakest interaction was observed for Ile228 (-13.78\u202fkcal/mol). Molecular electrostatic potential surface revealed complementary regions for dipole interactions and charge distribution analysis further shows that INH generally donates electrons to the residues. The results in this study agrees with the previous experimental findings and provides new insights into the catalase dependent activation of INH and the methods presented may be valuable in the study of biological metabolism of molecules."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is a proven means to prevent tuberculosis (TB) disease among people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, there is a concern that patients often develop tuberculosis disease while receiving IPT, defined here as breakthrough tuberculosis, which may affect treatment outcome. In this study, we assessed the magnitude and determinants of breakthrough tuberculosis. METHODS:A multisite retrospective longitudinal study from the year 2005 to 2014 involving 11 randomly selected hospitals from the Addis Ababa, SNNPR (Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region), and Gambela regions of Ethiopia was carried out to assess the occurrence of breakthrough tuberculosis. Cox regression analysis was used to study factors associated with breakthrough TB. RESULTS:4,484 patients in chronic HIV care received IPT. Eighty percent of the same number received antiretroviral therapy (ART). Tuberculosis developed in 88 of 4,484 (2%) patients of which 24 (0.5%) were diagnosed while receiving IPT. Breakthrough TB incidence was 1106 per 100,000 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 742-1651) while TB incidence after completing IPT was 624 per 100,000 PY (95% CI: 488-797). Seven of the 24 (29%) breakthrough TB cases were diagnosed within the first month of IPT initiation. Of 15 patients who developed breakthrough TB while on ART, nine (60%) were diagnosed within the first six months of ART initiation. Having high CD4 cell count and being on ART were associated with having lower risk of developing TB and breakthrough TB. CONCLUSION:Breakthrough TB was uncommon in the study setting. Even then, taking ART reduced the risk of its occurrence. Slightly more than a quarter of the cases of breakthrough TB occurred in the first month of treatment and may be existing undiagnosed TB cases which were missed during diagnostic work-up."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is diagnosed immunologically using the Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). While widely used, immunodiagnostics can produce false negative or false positive results. Pathogen biomarkers provide an alternative, but direct detection in LTBI and extrapulmonary TB cases is challenging. Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows slowly, has limited hematogenous movement, is protected by a lipid rich cell wall, and produces low levels of secreted factors. Here we discuss the potential of elicitors by first considering pathogen markers that may be released following the administration of isoniazid. Isoniazid targets the cell wall of mycobacteria found in extracellular compartments and within monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells. Isoniazid's dual-purpose potential as an antibiotic and elicitor is supported by knowledge of latent infection dynamics, time-kill kinetics, and new detection techniques. Within hours, the bactericidal action of isoniazid likely enriches plasma with M. tuberculosis DNA, RNA, proteins/peptides, and lipids. Undoubtedly a portion of these biomarkers are eliminated as some bacilli undergo phagocytosis and lysosomal destruction. However, advances in immunoprecipitation and nucleic acid amplification, combined with the use of larger blood volumes during assay development, may overcome these losses. Other anticipated challenges include determining optimal sample collection times and designing diagnostic workflows that minimize processing-associated marker loss and degradation. Conventional, commercial, and emerging technologies that address these variables are discussed.

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals in Sub Saharan Africa including Tanzania. Provision of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is one of the public health interventions to reduce the burden of TB among HIV infected persons. However there is limited information about the influence of IPT on TB incidence in Tanzania. This study aimed at ascertaining the effect of IPT on TB incidence and to determine risk factors for TB among HIV positive adults in Dar es Salaam region. METHODS:A retrospective cohort study was conducted using secondary data of HIV positive adults receiving care and treatment services in Dar es Salaam region from 2011 to 2014. TB incidence rate among HIV positive adults on IPT was compared to those who were not on IPT during the follow up period. Risk factors for incident TB were estimated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS:A total of 68,378 HIV positive adults were studied. The median follow up time was 3.4 (IQR\u2009=\u20091.9-3.8) years for patients who ever received IPT and 1.3 (IQR\u2009=\u20090.3-1.3) years among those who never received IPT. A total of 3124\u2009TB cases occurred during 114,926 total person-years of follow up. The overall TB incidence rate was 2.7/100 person-years (95%CI; 2.6-2.8). Patients on IPT had 48% lower TB incidence rate compared to patients who were not on IPT (IRR\u2009=\u20090.52, 95%CI; 0.46-0.59). Factors associated with higher risk for incident TB included; being male (aHR\u2009=\u20091.8, 95% CI; 1.6-2.0), WHO stage III (aHR\u2009=\u20092.7, 95% CI; 2.3-3.3) and IV (aHR\u2009=\u20092.4, 95% CI; 1.9-3.1),being underweight (aHR\u2009=\u20091.7, 95% CI; 1.5-1.9) while overweight (aHR\u2009=\u20090.7, 95% CI; 0.6-0.8), obese (aHR\u2009=\u20090.5, 95% CI; 0.4-0.7), having baseline CD4 cell count between 200 and 350 cells/\u03bcl (aHR\u2009=\u20090.7, 95% CI; 0.6-0.8) and CD4 count above 350 cells/\u03bcl (aHR\u2009=\u20090.5, 95% CI; 0.4-0.6) were associated with lower risk of developing TB. CONCLUSION:Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) has shown to be effective in reducing TB incidence among HIV infected adults in Dar es Salaam. More efforts are needed to increase the provision and coverage of IPT."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Background:Antimicrobial resistance is a global concern of increasing significance. Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is spreading worldwide. It is important to monitor trends of antimycobacterial resistance. This is particularly true for high TB burden countries such as Ethiopia where disproportionally less drug sensitivity data are reported from. Methods:The prevalence of drug resistance was assessed with the line probe assay GenoType MTBDRplus in a set of 161\u2009M. tuberculosis strains that were selected from four common lineages and sub-lineages previously identified in Ethiopia. Most of the tested M. tuberculosis isolates had been genotyped by established Spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing methods. Results:The proportion of MDR-TB among the isolates was 3.1%. Mono-resistance was 1.2% to rifampicin and 4.3% to isoniazid, and resistance to either of the two first line drugs was 8.7%. Strains of Lineage 4 had the highest resistance rate (13.6%) followed by Lineage 3 (4.9%). None of the isolates representing Lineages 1 and Lineage 7 were drug resistant. Multidrug resistance among pulmonary TB and TB lymphadenitis clinical isolates was 2.8 and 3.7%, respectively. Drug resistance of strains carrying the most prevalent spoligotype in Ethiopia - SIT149 - was further explored. Stratification by MIRU-VNTR identified one genotype with a high rate of drug resistance against Rifampicin and Isoniazid and circulation of a potential MDR-TB clone is proposed. Conclusion:Although the strain selection was not fully randomized, the overall M. tuberculosis drug resistance rate in this strain set was 8.7% while the rate of MDR was 3.1%. In parallel, we identified a sub-lineage that showed a high rate of resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid. These resistant strains may belong to a clone of M. tuberculosis that is circulating in the highlands of Ethiopia."}

While nano-drug delivery systems present as promising strategies for INH delivery, the therapeutic efficacies are usually suboptimal due to ineffective drug accumulation at diseased sites. Local delivery system can achieve high drug concentration at focus sites with minimal systemic exposure, and herein we aimed to employ this strategy to develop a novel liposome-in-hydrogel system for localized treatment of bone TB. To achieve sustainable drug release, a derivative of INH called DINH was loaded because of its hydrophobicity, as well as its better activity and higher biosafety than INH. The hybrid system was demonstrated for thermo-responsive and self-healing properties via phase transition test and rheological studies, which were particularly useful for intra-articular administration. In vivo microdialysis studies revealed that the system can rapidly release drug into synovial fluid to reach effective inhibitory concentrations after localized injection, followed by a steady-state drug release. The optical image studies were performed to study its long-term behavior in vivo, which suggested a sustained drug release profile for several days. This work provides a promising drug delivery system for bone TB therapy."}
{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Isoniazid (INH) is one among the four first-line drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis. The bactericidal activity of INH is due to its ability to inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, which is an integral component of the mycobacterial cell wall. Non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is phenotypically resistant to INH. The exact mechanism of this resistance is not clear, although the inability of dormant MTB to convert the pro-drug into an active form is thought to be one of the possible reasons. Employing targeted metabolomics approach, we show that dormant MTB can metabolize INH into its active INH-NAD+ adduct form. Further we show that the dormant bacteria have unaltered gene expression levels of katG and inhA (INH metabolizing enzymes). Transcript levels of drug efflux pump proteins which were low during dormancy did not increase in response to INH treatment. These findings point to an alternative mechanism for INH resistance in dormant MTB, which needs to be further elucidated."}

Directly-observed therapy (DOT) remains the standard of care for pulmonary TB. Virtual treatment monitoring using digital technologies is becoming more common as a way to provide a more patient-centered approach to care. Attempts to shorten treatment duration have been unsuccessful based on recent clinical trials evaluating the role of fluoroquinolones. Treatment-shortening trials using higher doses of rifamycins are currently underway. Recently approved medications for TB treatment are recommended only for drug-resistant disease, but novel agents in varying stages of development are being evaluated. Rifamycin-based regimens for latent TB infection (LTBI) have been successful in preventing progression to TB disease. Once-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for 12 weeks by DOT was shown to be safe and effective compared with 9 months of isoniazid. The same regimen was shown to have acceptable treatment completion when given self-administered. Newer studies are investigating even shorter LTBI treatment with durations of less than 2 months. Treatment of LTBI in people likely infected with multidrug resistant TB is very limited, but one observational study found that fluoroquinolones appear to be effective.

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "PURPOSE:Results of an assessment of the chemical stability of isoniazid injection in 0.9% sodium chloride injection and 5% dextrose injection are reported. METHODS:Triplicate solutions of isoniazid (0.5 and 6.0 mg/mL) in the 2 diluents were prepared in ethylene and propylene copolymer i.v. containers and stored under light protection at room temperature (20-25 \u00b0C) or under refrigeration (2-8 \u00b0C). Standard aliquots were removed from each solution at time points up to 72 hours and analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Stability was defined as retention of >90% of the initial isoniazid concentration; pH, osmolality, and visual appearance were assessed. RESULTS:Isoniazid 0.5- and 6.0-mg/mL solutions in 0.9% sodium chloride injection were stable for up to 72 hours at room temperature or under refrigeration. HPLC analysis of isoniazid 0.5-mg/mL solutions in 5% dextrose injection revealed a decrease to less than 90% of the initial concentration at 8 hours at room temperature and at 30 hours under refrigeration. Isoniazid 6.0-mg/mL solutions in 5% dextrose injection were stable for 24 hours at room temperature and for 48 hours under refrigeration. The pH, osmolality, and visual appearance of the solutions were not affected. CONCLUSION:Isoniazid solutions of 0.5 and 6.0 mg/mL in 0.9% sodium chloride injection were stable under light protection for up to 72 hours when stored at room temperature or under refrigeration.

To understand the mechanisms of action of TCH we isolated M. tuberculosis TCH resistant mutants which fell into two groups; one resistant to TCH and Isoniazid but not to Ethionamide or Triclosan, and the other resistant only to TCH with no, or marginal, cross resistance to Isoniazid. A S315T katG mutation conferred resistance to TCH while katG expression from a plasmid reduced M. tuberculosis MIC to this drug, suggesting a possible involvement of KatG in TCH activation. Whole genome sequencing of mutants from this second group revealed a single mutation in the alkylhydroperoxide reductase ahpC promoter locus in half of the mutants, while the remaining contained mutations in dispensable genes. This is the first report of the genetics underlying the action of TCH and of the involvement of ahpC as the sole basis for resistance to an anti-tubercular compound."}

{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "RATIONALE:Osteitis corresponds to a rare but potentially serious complication reported in pediatric population after the application of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. In the present study, 3 clinical cases associated with this entity are reported. PATIENT CONCERNS:The 1st case corresponds to a 1-year-old female patient who presented an increase in the volume of the right pelvic limb after BCG application. The second case is a 2-year-old male who began with an increase in volume, overactive gait and pain at the level of the left knee on walking that began after a trauma in the left low limb. The 3rd case corresponds to a 3-year-old patient who started with intense pain and limitation for ambulation. DIAGNOSIS:Both the radiographical and histological studies presented data suggestive of infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, corroborated through biopsy and genotyping analysis with the isolation of Mycobacterium bovis as the causal agent. INTERVENTIONS:The basic treatment scheme was based on Ethambutol, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Isoniazid. When M. bovis was typified, clarithromycin was added in the treatment. OUTCOMES:Osteitis secondary to BCG vaccine usually has a favorable evolution, especially in immunocompetent patients. LESSONS:It was possible to confirm the association of BCG vaccine with the clinical picture of the patients who presented improvement after the start of antimicrobial management. Osteitis secondary to BCG vaccine usually presents a favorable evolution, especially in immunocompetent patients; however, the involvement of joint, growth discs and vertebrae increases the risk of presenting long-term sequels."}
{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "Isoniazid (INH) and ethambutol (EMB) are two major first-line drugs for managing tuberculosis (TB), caused by the microbe Mycobacterium tuberculosis Although co-use of these two drugs is common in clinical practice, the mechanism for the potential synergistic interplay between them remains unclear. Here, we present first evidence that INH and EMB act synergistically through a transcriptional repressor of the inhA gene, the target gene of INH encoding an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase of the fatty acid synthase type II system required for bacterial cell wall integrity. We report that EMB binds a hypothetical transcription factor encoded by the Rv0273c gene, designated here as EtbR. Using DNA footprinting, we found that EtbR specifically recognizes a motif sequence in the upstream region of the inhA gene. Using isothermal titration calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance assays, we observed that EMB binds EtbR in a 1:1 ratio and thereby stimulates its DNA-binding activity. When a nonlethal dose of EMB was delivered in combination with INH, EMB increased the INH susceptibility of cultured M. tuberculosis cells. In summary, EMB induces EtbR-mediated repression of inhA and thereby enhances the mycobactericidal effect of INH. Our findings uncover a molecular mechanism for the synergistic activity of two important anti-TB drugs."}

However, asymptomatic pulmonary carriage of the TB bacteria contributes to sustenance of the disease in the community and subsequent transmission. The present study was carried out to see the prevalence of culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis in apparently asymptomatic individuals from the community.MethodsThe study population consisted of individuals wishing to migrate to the USA/UK/Canada/Australia and submitting for the mandatory health check prior to obtaining the Visa. Chest X-ray was the initial screening test for diagnosis of tuberculosis. Individuals with any X-ray abnormalities were directed to submit three sputum samples for microscopy and culture which was done on automated culture systems (BacTALERT and MGIT). First-line drug susceptibility (INH, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol, Streptomycin) testing data were retrieved wherever available. Data were obtained for a period of 7 years from August 2010 to July 2017.ResultsA total of 140,499 individuals presented for the health check. Of these, 1,002 (0.7%) were further investigated using sputum microscopy and culture based on chest X-ray findings. Of these, 42 (0.4%) individuals were sputum culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Except two, none had any respiratory complaints. Eleven (27.5%) of them were smear positive for acid fast bacilli. Most of the patients (30%) belonged to the age group of 18\u201325 years. Eighty-four percent had no prior history of tuberculosis or treatment for TB. Fifty-nine percent isolates were sensitive to all first-line drugs (Isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin). Twenty-seven percent were resistant to pyrazinamide alone. Fourteen percent were resistant to more than one first-line drug. There were no cases of multidrug resistance.ConclusionThis is a unique large-scale study which assesses prevalence of culture positive pulmonary tuberculosis in the urban Indian community. It stresses the need for more stringent public health measures to curb transmission of the disease in such a high endemic region such as India.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures."}
{"keyword": "Isoniazid", "texts": "OBJECTIVES:Isoniazid (INH) is still the most important first-line antitubercular drug. INH resistance is regarded as a major impediment to the tuberculosis (TB) control programme and contributes to the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. Mutation at position 315 in the katG gene, encoding the catalase-peroxidase (KatG) enzyme, is the major cause of INH resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, investigation of the molecular mechanisms of INH resistance is the need of the hour. METHODS:To understand the clinical importance of KatG mutants (MTs) leading to INH resistance, in this study five MTs (S315T, S315I, S315R, S315N and S315G) were modelled, docked and interacted with INH in dynamic state. RESULTS:The binding affinity based on docking was found to be higher for MTs than for wild-type (WT) isolates, except for MT-S315R, indicating rigid binding of INH with MT proteins compared with the flexible binding seen in the WT. Analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) experiments suggested that fluctuations and deviations were higher at the INH binding residues for MTs than for the WT. Reduction in the hydrogen bond network after MD in all KatG enzymes implies an increase in the flexibility and stability of protein structures. Superimposition of MTs upon the WT structure showed a significant deviation that varies for the different MTs. CONCLUSIONS:It can be inferred that the five KatG MTs affect enzyme activity in different ways, which could be attributed to conformational changes in MT KatG that result in altered binding affinity to INH and eventually to INH resistance."}

In addition, the targeting performance of the FA-MLHNPs increased the cellular uptake of NPs in the case of HeLa cells.

{"keyword": "Doxorubicin Hydrochloride", "texts": "Cancer therapy often relies on the combined action of different molecules to overcome drug resistance and enhance patient outcome. Combined strategies relying on molecules with different pharmacokinetics often fail due to the lack of concomitant tumor accumulation and, thus, to the loss of synergistic effect. Due to their ability to enhance treatment efficiency, improve drug pharmacokinetics, and reduce adverse effects, polymer nanoparticles (PNPs) have been widely investigated as co-delivery vehicles for cancer therapies. However, co-encapsulation of different drugs and probes in PNPs requires a flexible polymer platform and a tailored particle design, in which both the bulk and surface properties of the carriers are carefully controlled. In this work, we propose a core-shell PNP design based on a polyurethane (PUR) core and a phospholipid external surface. The modulation of the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the PUR core enhanced the encapsulation of two chemotherapeutics with dramatically different water solubility (Doxorubicin hydrochloride, DOXO and Docetaxel, DCTXL) and of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles for MRI imaging. The outer shell remained unchanged among the platforms, resulting in un-modified cellular uptake and in vivo biodistribution. We demonstrate that the choice of PUR core allowed a high entrapment efficiency of all drugs, superior or comparable to previously reported results, and that higher core hydrophilicity enhances the loading efficiency of the hydrophilic DOXO and the MRI contrast effect. Moreover, we show that changing the PUR core did not alter the surface properties of the carriers, since all particles showed a similar behavior in terms of cell internalization and in vivo biodistribution. We also show that PUR PNPs have high passive tumor accumulation and that they can efficient co-deliver the two drugs to the tumor, reaching an 11-fold higher DOXO/DCTXL ratio in tumor as compared to free drugs. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Exploiting the synergistic action of multiple chemotherapeutics is a promising strategy to improve the outcome of cancer patients, as different agents can simultaneously engage different features of tumor cells and/or their microenvironment. Unfortunately, the choice is limited to drugs with similar pharmacokinetics that can concomitantly accumulate in tumors. To expand the spectrum of agents that can be delivered in combination, we propose a multi-compartmental core-shell nanoparticles approach, in which the core is made of biomaterials with high affinity for drugs of different physical properties. We successfully co-encapsulated Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, Docetaxel, and contrast agents and achieved a significantly higher concomitant accumulation in tumor versus free drugs, demonstrating that nanoparticles can improve synergistic cancer chemotherapy."}
{"keyword": "Doxorubicin Hydrochloride", "texts": "RATIONALE:Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common malignant tumor in HIV-infected people and occurs mainly in the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. Approximately 33% of the initial skin manifestations of AIDS and approximately 35% to 79% of KS occur during disease progression. Otherwise, AIDS-related facial KS that was simultaneously examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is rare. PATIENT CONCERNS:This case was a 30-year-old male homosexual, with left facial nodule for 14 months, and HIV infection was diagnosed 1 month previously. The patient was admitted to hospital because the nodule gradually expanded from 0.2 to 10.0\u200acm in diameter. Ultrasound examination showed edema of the subcutaneous tissue of the left facial mass, and the boundary was not clear between lesion and normal tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated that the left facial mass showed low signal intensity on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and a small amount of high signal intensity was seen in it. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) showed low signal intensity. After enhanced scan, the tumor showed uneven enhancement. DIAGNOSES:The pathological biopsy indicated KS. INTERVENTIONS:The patient began chemotherapy with the intravenous drip infusion of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome. OUTCOMES:The facial KS decreased and the facial swelling was relieved. LESSONS:MRI could not only provide the diagnostic basis of KS for the therapy, but also could accurately determine the scope of the disease."}

Buccal permeation studies were conducted using Franz diffusion cells. Cumulative amounts of RH were plotted versus time. The presence of the permeation enhancers significantly increased the transport of the drug across the porcine buccal epithelium compared to its plain congener (RH solution). The rank order effect of the permeation enhancers for the transport of RH across buccal epithelium was TMC\u2009\u2265\u2009SBE-\u03b2-CD\u2009>\u2009HP-\u03b2-CD\u2009>\u2009RH solution. The presence of TMC increased 1.34-fold the transport of RH across buccal epithelium, whereas an increase of 1.23- and 1.28-fold was reported in the presence of HP-\u03b2-CD and SBE-\u03b2-CD, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) was employed to investigate the interaction of permeation enhancers with the epithelial lipids of porcine buccal mucosa corroborating the permeation results. Finally, light microscopy was performed to assess the histological changes in the porcine epithelium. Formation of vacuoles, spongiosis and acantholysis linear detachment and destruction of the epithelium resulted from the presence of the permeation enhancers. The data suggest that all enhancers tested, and particularly TMC, increase the transport of RH across buccal epithelium."}

In vitro release studies were performed in simulated nasal electrolyte solution (SNES) pH5.5 at 35\u00b0C. Ex vivo permeation studies were conducted across sheep nasal mucosa. Cytocompatibility was tested in cultured human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3). SEM studies revealed spheroid microparticles in the range of 2.09\u03bcm to 2.41\u03bcm. The presence of trimethylchitosan (TMC) induced a slight shift towards less negative \u03b6-potential values. Surface chemistry (XPS) revealed the presence of dipalmitoylphospatidylcholine (DPPC) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) onto microparticles' surface, further corroborating the FT-IR and XRD findings. In vitro release studies showed that the microparticle composition can partly modulate the release of RH. Ex vivo studies demonstrated a 2.35-folded enhancement of RH permeation when RH was co-formulated with TMC of low molecular weight, compared to the control. All formulations tested were found to be non-toxic to cells. The results suggest that polymer-lipid microparticles may be a promising carrier for the nasal delivery of RH."}

The ethosomes were prepared using different concentrations of phospholipids (2-5 % w/v), ethanol (20-50 % w/v), ropinirole HCl (5 % w/v) and water. They were optimized using 3(2) full factorial designs to study the effect of independent variables, concentrations of ethanol and lecithin on dependent variables, entrapment efficiency and in-vitro drug release at 24 hrs. The drug release profile exhibited Higuchi's and zero order kinetics. From the regression analysis, it was observed that independent variables had significant effect on response variables. Formulations were optimized using contour plot and response surface plot. The optimized formulation was found to be RS10 containing 30 % w/v ethanol and 4% w/v lecithin. The optimized formulation was evaluated for assay, particle characteristics, zeta potential, skin retention and stability. Ethosomal gel was prepared by incorporation of optimized ethosomal suspension into gel base. The ethosomal gel was characterized for physical appearance, pH, content uniformity, rheological behaviour, skin-retention, in-vitro and in-vivo drug release and stability. From the results it can fairly be concluded that ethosomes are capable of delivering ropinirole hydrochloride into systemic circulation by transdermal route. The amounts thus delivered are also equitable to those delivered orally and are delivered at a rate slow enough to achieve longer blood levels."}

This study was conducted to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy after repeated oral administration of prolonged-release tablets of ropinirole hydrochloride in the absence of L-dopa preparations in Japanese patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: This was a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study. The total duration of participation in the study ranged from 56 to 63 weeks. In the study, the plasma concentrations of ropinirole, its major metabolite SK&F104557 (N-depropyl ropinirole) and another metabolite SK&F89124 (ropinirole hydroxylated at the seventh position of the indole ring) were assessed. Safety based on adverse events, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis and electrocardiography (ECG) (standard 12-lead ECG) were evaluated, and vital signs (blood pressure/pulse rate) were measured. Efficacy based on the Japanese version of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts III (motor) and II [activities of daily living (ADL)] as well as tolerability was evaluated. RESULTS: After repeated oral administration of prolonged-release tablets of ropinirole hydrochloride in Japanese patients with PD, ropinirole, SK&F104557 and low levels of SK&F89124 were detected in plasma. The trough concentrations of ropinirole and the two metabolites increased in proportion to the dose when ropinirole hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets were administered at doses ranging from 2 to 16 mg/day. The plasma exposure to ropinirole and its two metabolites after intake of normal diet was comparable to that in the fasting state. The most common adverse events (10% or more) were somnolence, nausea, constipation, hallucination and nasopharyngitis. Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity, and with no death. During the treatment period, serious adverse events were reported in five patients. Efficacy analysis (LOCF) at the final endpoint up to week 16 demonstrated a mean (SD) change from baseline in the Japanese UPDRS III (motor) and II (ADL) scores of -11\u00b73 (8\u00b721) and -3\u00b79 (3\u00b722), respectively, and thereafter remained at similar levels until week 52. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: After administration of prolonged-release tablets of ropinirole hydrochloride in the absence of L-dopa preparations in Japanese patients with PD, the plasma pharmacokinetics of ropinirole and its metabolites was linear and not affected by food. Compared with the immediate-release (IR) tablet, the prolonged-release tablet can be administered to Japanese patients with PD at a reduced daily dose frequency and adjusted to the maintenance dose after fewer dose changes with a smaller diurnal variation in the plasma ropinirole concentration."}

According to the results obtained, we may conclude that analyzed ropinirole hydrochloride tablets satisfied pharmacopeial requirements concerning content uniformity and dissolution testing. In this case RSD tended to increase with the decrease of the labeled strength. It is obvious from the R2 value, as well.

The convective contribution to ropinirole electrotransport was evaluated by following the transport of the electroosmotic marker mannitol.Ropinirole flux decreased dramatically in the presence of competing ions. This effect was observed even when the molar fraction of the two competing cations was kept constant. Anodal flux of mannitol decreased with drug concentration, indicating a possible alteration of the skin permselectivity. In the absence of competing co-ions, ropinirole transport number reached a maximum value (8-13%). In these conditions, the main factor controlling drug delivery was the intensity of current applied.Transdermal iontophoresis allowed the delivery of therapeutic doses of ropinirole.

REQUIP XL was composed of more than 10 kinds of excipients and prepared by Geomatrix technology, which was complex and laborious. The purpose of this study was to obtain a dosage form of RH with similar in vitro release profile and bioequivalence in vivo compared to REQUIP XL. Osmotic pump tablet combined with fast release phase was selected as the delivery system of RH and similar release curves were obtained in different media. The tablets were also administered to beagle dogs and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental model. Cmax, tmax, mean residence time (MRT), and area under the curve from 0 to 24\u2009h (AUC0-24) were 3.97\u2009\u00b1\u20090.53\u2009ng/mL, 3.58\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49\u2009h, 8.29\u2009\u00b1\u20090.93\u2009h, and 35.20\u2009\u00b1\u20098.11\u2009ng/mL\u2009\u010b\u2009h for ropinirole osmotic pump tablets (ROPT) and 4.15\u2009\u00b1\u20091.07\u2009ng/mL, 2.92\u2009\u00b1\u20090.49\u2009h, 7.84\u2009\u00b1\u20091.09\u2009h, and 34.34\u2009\u00b1\u200910.06\u2009ng/mL\u2009\u010b\u2009h for REQUIP XL. The log-transformed mean Cmax and AUC0-24 of ROPT were about 92.15% and 102.49% relative to that of REQUIP XL, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals of Cmax and AUC0-24 for ROPT were 75.69-115.31% and 88.89-122.30%, respectively.

The proband showed severe generalized chorea, delayed motor development, subnormal intelligence, congenital hypothyroidism, bronchial asthma, and a history of pulmonary infection, all of which are characteristic features of Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome. On the other hand, her brother and mother showed a mild benign hereditary chorea (BHC) phenotype with congenital hypothyroidism. Intrafamilial phenotypic variation is common in BHC/Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome and suggests the existence of other genetic or environmental factors regulating TITF-1 function. Although choreic movement in BHC/Brain-Thyroid-Lung syndrome is recognized as non-progressive, the proband showed re-exacerbation of choreic movement at puberty. The dopamine agonist, ropinirole hydrochloride, reduced her choreic movements, suggesting that levodopa and/or dopamine agonists may compensate for underdeveloped dopaminergic pathways in this disorder."}
{"keyword": "ropinirole hydrochloride", "texts": "For the first time, the binding of ropinirole hydrochloride (ROP) and aspirin (ASA) to human holo-transferrin (hTf) has been investigated by spectroscopic approaches (fluorescence quenching, synchronous fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, three-dimensional fluorescence, UV-vis absorption, circular dichroism, resonance light scattering), as well as zeta potential and molecular modeling techniques, under simulated physiological conditions. Fluorescence analysis was used to estimate the effect of the ROP and ASA drugs on the fluorescence of hTf as well as to define the binding and quenching properties of binary and ternary complexes. The synchronized fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra demonstrated some micro-environmental and conformational changes around the Trp and Tyr residues with a faint red shift. Thermodynamic analysis displayed the van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonds interactions are the major acting forces in stabilizing the complexes. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence data revealed that the fluorescence quenching of complexes are static mechanism. The effect of the drugs aggregating on the hTf resulted in an enhancement of the resonance light scattering (RLS) intensity. The average binding distance between were computed according to the forster non-radiation energy transfer theory. The circular dichroism (CD) spectral examinations indicated that the binding of the drugs induced a conformational change of hTf. Measurements of the zeta potential indicated that the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions between ROP, ASA and hTf formed micelle-like clusters. The molecular modeling confirmed the experimental results. This study is expected to provide important insight into the interaction of hTf with ROP and ASA to use in various toxicological and therapeutic processes."}

{"keyword": "ropinirole hydrochloride", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Although most studies have suggested an increased risk of valvulopathy (primarily regurgitation) with pergolide mesylate use, one study suggested that this problem may also occur with use of the non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists pramipexole dihydrochloride and ropinirole hydrochloride. OBJECTIVE: To determine if cardiac valve regurgitation occurs more commonly in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated with pergolide than in those treated with nonergot agonists at a comparable dose. DESIGN: A case-control study of echocardiographic findings of valve function in patients receiving dopamine agonists for PD. SETTING: University-based referral center. Patients Thirty-six patients with idiopathic PD taking pergolide were compared with a matched control group of patients taking nonergot agonists with regard to the frequency and severity of cardiac valve regurgitation. Main Outcome Measure Valve scores (1 indicates trace; 2, mild; 3, moderate; and 4, severe) for the pergolide group were compared with those for the nonergot agonist control group. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD valve regurgitation scores in the matched pergolide group compared with the nonergot group were as follows: aortic, 0.83 +/- 1.23 vs 0.19 +/- 0.53 (P = .01); mitral, 1.42 +/- 1.0 vs 0.39 +/- 0.65 (P<.001); and tricuspid, 1.43 +/- 1.0 vs 0.19 +/- 0.53 (P<.001). Lifetime exposure to a dopamine agonist was not statistically different between the pergolide and nonergot agonist groups (P = .18). CONCLUSIONS: These data strengthen the conclusion that pergolide contributes to cardiac valve regurgitation when used in the long term as a treatment for PD. There appears to be low risk of cardiac valve regurgitation when using non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists."}
{"keyword": "ropinirole hydrochloride", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) treated with the nonergot dopamine agonists pramipexole dihydrochloride and ropinirole hydrochloride have been reported to have sleep attacks without warning. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic evaluation of excessive daytime sleepiness using standard polysomnographic techniques. DESIGN: Two overnight studies and daytime sleep tests were performed on a prospective sample. Pathologic daytime sleep latency was indexed by a mean Multiple Sleep Latency Test score of no greater than 5 minutes or a mean Maintenance of Wakefulness Test latency of no greater than 20 minutes. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Eighty nondemented, independent PD patients treated with dopamine agonists at the Toronto Western Hospital Sleep Research Unit, Toronto, Ontario. RESULTS: Patients treated with pramipexole dihydrochloride (n = 29), ropinirole (n = 28), or bromocriptine mesylate or pergolide mesylate (n = 23) did not differ with respect to mean Multiple Sleep Latency Test scores (overall, 12.1 minutes [SD, 5.1 minutes], F(2,77) = 0.11; P =.90) or mean Maintenance of Wakefulness Test latencies (overall, 26.7 minutes [SD, 5.4 minutes]; F(2,77) = 1.1; P =.29). Fifteen patients (18.8%) exhibited pathologic daytime sleep latencies. The main risk factor associated with pathologic daytime sleep latency was high levodopa dosage equivalents (>867.5 mg; odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-13.7). Subjective accounts of daytime sleep and wakefulness, as indexed by scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, were not related to impaired daytime sleepiness or wakefulness (chi(2)(1) [n = 80], 0.13; P =.72). CONCLUSIONS: Total dopaminergic drug dose rather than the specific dopamine agonist used is the best predictor of daytime sleepiness in PD patients receiving dopamine agonist therapy. Physicians concerned with daytime hypersomnolence in PD patients treated with dopamine agonists and receiving high levodopa dosage equivalents should consider polysomnographic monitoring for impaired daytime sleep latency."}

{"keyword": "ropinirole hydrochloride", "texts": "1. The disposition and metabolic fate of ropinirole, a novel compound indicated for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease, was studied in the mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey and man, following oral and intravenous administration of ropinirole hydrochloride. 2. In all species, nearly all of the p.o. administered dose (94%) was rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following administration of 14C-ropinirole hydrochloride. In rat and monkey, the compound distributed rapidly beyond total body water and was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier. Blood clearance of the compound was high, approximately equal to one-half the hepatic blood flow in the monkey and similar to the hepatic blood flow in rat. Terminal phase elimination half-lives for the compound were relatively short (0.5 and 1.3 h in rat and monkey respectively), although there was evidence of a second elimination phase in the monkey with an elimination half-life of approximately 5-11 h. Plasma concentrations of ropinirole after the intravenous dose were not determined in the mouse and were below the lower limit of quantification in man (0.08 ng/ml) at the doses used in the studies described in this paper. 3. In both animals and man, ropinirole was extensively metabolized. In the rat, the major metabolic pathway was via hydroxylation of the aromatic ring to form 7-hydroxy ropinirole. In mouse, monkey and man, the major pathway was via N-depropylation. The N-despropyl metabolite was metabolized further to form 7-hydroxy and carboxylic acid derivatives. Metabolites formed in all species were generally metabolized further by glucuronidation. 7-Hydroxy ropinirole is the only metabolite of ropinirole previously shown to possess significant dopamine agonist activity in vivo. In all species, the major route of excretion of ropinirole-related material after oral or intravenous administration of the compound was renal (60-90% of dose)."}

INTERVENTION: Use of ropinirole or placebo therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The efficacy variables were the number of patients who successfully completed the 12-month study and did not require supplemental levodopa, the number of patients requiring supplemental levodopa, and the proportion of patients having an insufficient therapeutic response.

{"keyword": "ropinirole hydrochloride", "texts": "OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency and severity of acute orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease who are starting dopamine agonist therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the context of an outpatient clinical practice, 29 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease who were starting dopamine agonist therapy were brought into the clinic for their first dose of agonist. After a baseline supine and standing blood pressure assessment, patients were given a test dose of either pergolide mesylate (0.025, 0.05, 0. 125, or 0.25 mg), pramipexole dihydrochloride (0.125 mg), or ropinirole hydrochloride (0.125 or 0.25 mg). At 3 selected times, blood pressure readings were repeated in the supine and standing positions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a drop in either systolic blood pressure of more than 25 mm Hg or diastolic pressure of more than 10 mm Hg. Patients with OH before the administration of the dopamine agonist were excluded. RESULTS: Ten subjects (34%) met the criteria for acute OH. There was no evidence that OH was related to the use of a specific dopamine agonist or the concurrent use of levodopa. Of the patients who met the criteria for OH, only 3 (30%) had symptoms of OH, such as lightheadedness or general malaise. CONCLUSIONS: Acute OH occurs frequently when starting dopamine agonist therapy in Parkinson's disease, but is frequently not appreciated by patients.

METHOD:Male adults who were addicted to opioids, aged 18 to 79 years were enrolled (n=96) and randomized into two oral doses (4 & 8 mg) of ondansetron (n=32) and placebo (n=32). The vital signs and withdrawal symptoms and the frequency requirement of fentanyl were recorded during anesthesia, and opioid (pethidine) analgesic were received the period of recovery. Outcome parameters were analyzed for reduction of withdrawal symptoms in adult addicted patients. RESULTS:We indicated that ondansetron demonstrated significant differences with few vital outcomes including systolic blood pressure (BPS) 20 (BPS 3) and 50 min (BPS 4) after injection of ondansetron during the period of the surgery. Ondansetron could also significantly reduce the frequency requirement of fentanyl at 20 min (Dose 3) in general anesthesia. Furthermore, requirement for further administration of opioid analgesic drugs such as pethidine were significantly reduced in the ondansetron groups. Objective opioid withdrawal scale (OOWS) results indicated that few clinical parameters including tremor, hot and cold flushes and anxiety were significantly attenuated in addicted patients who received ondansetron.

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:One of the important and predicted physiological effects of spinal anaesthesia is hypotension. A range of strategies including mechanical interventions, intravenous fluids and vasoconstrictor drugs have been used to minimise or prevent spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension. Observational studies suggest that ondansetron reduces the incidence of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) and support the use of combined fluid preloading and vasoconstrictors for this purpose (but with limited doses) to avoid side effects as fluid overload and tachycardia respectively. AIM:As no RCT had ever compared the use of Ondansetron alone with combined vasoconstrictors and fluid preload, so, this randomised controlled trial has evaluated the efficacy of the use of ondansetron alone compared to the combined use of fluid preload and vasoconstrictors to decrease the incidence of spinal hypotension. METHODS:Ninety patients of ASA grade I between the age of 18 and 45 years scheduled to undergo elective surgical procedures on the lower extremity or lower abdomen under spinal anaesthesia were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 45 each. Group I patients (ondansetron group) received 4 mg ondansetron in 5 ml normal saline (IV) 15 minutes before induction of spinal anaesthesia. Group II patients (combination group) received preloading with 7.5 ml/kg/min of Ringer's lactate over 10 minute period preceding the spinal block followed by intravenous bolus of 2.5 mg ephedrine in the first and second minute and 2.5 mg ephedrine every 5 minutes for the next 20 minutes after the injection of spinal anesthetic drug. Non-invasive measurement of mean arterial pressures, heart rate, reactive hypertension, nausea and vomiting were documented. RESULTS:The incidence of hypotension following the subarachnoid block in Group I (ondansetron group) was 17.6% versus group II (combination group) was 13.3%, while difference among the groups is statistically insignificant (P = 0.082). Group IV fluids alone could reverse hypotension in 57.1% of patients in group I 33.3% in group II. 42.9% of patients in group I and 67.7% in group II could not be managed with IV fluids alone and had to be treated with 5 mg boluses of ephedrine for reversal of hypotension. The difference in the mean number of fluid boluses and a dose of ephedrine used between both groups was statistically insignificant (P = 0.11 and P = 0.21). HR showed a significant increase in group II and a statistically insignificant change in group I with a statistically significant difference in the heart rate (HR) between both groups (P < 0.05). Reactive hypertension, nausea and vomiting between both groups were statistically insignificant. CONCLUSION:The preemptive use of Ondansetron alone versus combined vasoconstrictors with fluid preload significantly reduces the incidence of post-spinal hypotension (PSH) with no significant difference between both regimens.

OBJECTIVES:To determine the incidence of akathisia after PONV prophylaxis with two doses of droperidol in comparison with ondansetron, in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. We hypothesised that the incidence of akathisia is higher with droperidol than that with ondansetron. DESIGN:Randomised controlled double blind trial. SETTING:Two University Hospital Centres and two private Clinics from January to September 2014. PATIENTS:Patients (n=297) undergoing general anaesthesia for ambulatory surgery were randomly allocated to receive PONV prophylaxis with droperidol (0.625 or 1.25\u200amg) or ondansetron 4\u200amg; patients of the three groups also received 4\u200amg of dexamethasone. Exclusion criteria were contraindication to droperidol and ondansetron, use of psychotropic medications or benzodiazepines or history of psychotic illness. INTERVENTIONS:Participants received droperidol (0.625 or 1.25\u200amg) or ondansetron 4\u200amg during general anaesthesia.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:Score of the Global Clinical Assessment of Akathisia of Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. RESULTS:The number of akathisia observed was 1/118 (0.8%) in the ondansetron group, 1/84 (1.2%) in droperidol 0.625\u200amg group, and 3/87 (3.4%) in droperidol 1.25 mg group. The akathisia rate difference among the three groups was not significant (P\u200a=\u200a0.52).

N) received placebo (0.9% normal saline 1\u2009ml iv and 0.9% normal saline 2\u2009ml iv). The incidence and severity of PONV were observed at 1, 2, 4, and 24\u2009hr postsurgery. Results:At 1, 2, 4, and 24\u2009hr postsurgery, Gr. D had a lower incidence (7.4%, 11.1%, 29.6%, and 66.7%) and lower severity of PONV than Gr. N (18.5%, 29.6%, 37.0%, and 81.5% at 1, 2, 4, and 24\u2009hr; p > 0.05). The requirement for antiemetic drugs was not significantly different between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion:Administration of dexamethasone and ondansetron 4\u2009mg seemed to decrease the incidence of PONV in the first 24 hours but not significantly. Therefore, further studies are to be carried out by escalating either dexamethasone dose or the dose of ondansetron or both."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive debilitative neurodegenerative disease characterised mostly with bradykinesia, tremor, catatonia, drooping posture, unsteady gate and unstable steps. Levodopa has been proven to be among the most effective and acceptable treatment that can reconstitute dopamine in Parkinson's disease. However, there is a relation between levodopa long term administration and dyskinesia. Regarding the effectiveness of ondansetron in Parkinson's disease, we planned to test its effect on levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). In this study, Parkinsonism was induced in 40 adult male rats using 6-OHDA injection into the striatum via stereotaxic surgery. After 2 weeks, all animals tested for Parkinson's disease using apomorphine rotation test. Then, animals with positive symptoms for Parkinsonism divided into 4 equal groups, the first group treated with levodopa 50\u2009mg/kg i.p, the second group received only distilled water, the third and forth groups treated with levodopa 50\u2009mg/kg i.p plus two different doses of ondansetron (0.04 and 0.08\u2009mg/kg i.p) for 3 weeks. Animals tested for dyskinesia using AIMs and rotarod tests at specific days and a week after discontinuation of ondansetron. Evaluations of AIMs test showed significant changes in dyskinetic movements and reduction in scores in groups treating with ondansetron when compared with the first group. Upon discontinuations of ondansetron in the last two groups, AIMs scores significantly increased. While in rotarod test, ondansetron had no additional benefit when added to levodopa in motor coordination of animals. Findings of this study suggest that co administration of ondansetron with levodopa is effective in attenuating dyskinesia."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication after anesthesia and surgery. Ondansetron is one of the most widely used drugs in the prophylaxis of PONV and is extensively metabolized in humans. In vitro metabolism studies have shown that ondansetron is a substrate for human hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes. The cytochrome P450 (human hepatic cytochrome [CYP]) 2D6 inhibitor quinidine reduced in vitro hydroxylation of ondansetron, which indicates the important role of CYP2D6 in ondansetron metabolism. Genotyping these alleles allows the prediction of the extensive metabolizer (EM) and poor metabolizer (PM) phenotypes with approx. 90-96% accuracy. OBJECTIVES:The aim of our study was to evaluate whether the pharmacological prevention of PONV with ondansetron depends on the most common CYP2D6 alleles (CYP2D6*1, *3, *4, *5, and NxN [multiplication gene]). MATERIAL AND METHODS:Genotyping for the defective CYP2D6*3, CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*5 alleles among 93 surgical female patients was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS:The genetically defined EMs and ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) of CYP2D6 had a statistically significant (p < 0.02) higher frequency of nausea and vomiting after strumectomy (33.3%) than intermediate metabolizers (IMs) (10.3%) and PMs (0%). The relative risk (odds ratio [OR]) of PONV occurrence was 5 times higher for EMs/UMs than IMs/PMs. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that PONV treatment with ondansetron could be improved by basic, widely available and inexpensive PCR-RFLP genetic tests."}

There is growing evidence that adjunctive ondansetron treatment improves symptomatology associated with schizophrenia, particularly with respect to the positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Further studies that are applicable to real world practice are required to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of this treatment, which could be readily and rapidly translated into clinical practice. AIMS::This randomized control trial compared adjunctive (8 mg/daily) ondansetron or placebo to commonly prescribed atypical antipsychotics for people suffering with chronic schizophrenia ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01121042). METHODS::The study involved 85 outpatients aged 18-65 years with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who participated in a two-arm randomized control trial. RESULTS::Longitudinal analyses revealed adjunctive ondansetron provided significant improvement in the cognitive domain ( p<0.05) as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale between baseline and week 12. The analysis of \"Combination\" showed ondansetron effect on Total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, approaching significance by week 12 ( p=0.06). No group differences were obtained in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale or Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale subscales. CONCLUSION::This treatment trial provides some support for adjunctive ondansetron medication as a treatment for the cognitive disorganization symptoms of schizophrenia."}

MATERIAL AND METHODS:In this clinical trial study, 30 consecutive patients with skeletal class III deformities were candidates for orthognathic surgery in Qaem hospital, Mashhad University of medical sciences, Mashhad, Iran from March to November 2017. These subjects were randomly assigned to two equal number groups, ondansetron or clonidine. Patients received either oral ondansetron 8mg or oral clonidine 150\u03bcg as premedication, 1 hour before the surgery (both dissolved in 20 cc of water). Also both groups received intravenous dexamethasone 8mg (1 hour preoperatively and every 4 hours intraoperatively). RESULTS:In this study, a total of 30 patients (14 males and 16 females) with a mean age of 23.9 \u00b1 3.9 were investigated. The incidence of postoperative nausea in women was more than men (p=0.003), also the correlation between the incidence of PON and the surgery duration \u2265 3 hours was statistically significant (p = 0.050). The frequency of postoperative nausea (PON) in the ondansetron group was less than clonidine (53.3% vs 73.3% respectively). There was no postoperative vomiting (POV) in the ondansetron group, but 6.7% of cases in clonidine group suffered POV. Post-operative nausea in ondansetron group occurred significantly later than clonidine (525.0\u00b1233.2 vs 100.0\u00b134.0 min; p <0.001). On the other hand, the incidence time of post-operative severe pain or in other word the analgesia time in clonidine group was significantly more than ondansetron one (875/0\u00b168/5 vs 614.3\u00b1159.1 min; p <0.001).

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), through an Internet-based randomization service using a stratified variable-block randomization scheme, to single-dose oral ondansetron or placebo. The primary endpoint was intravenous rehydration (administration of \u226520 mL/kg of an isotonic fluid during 4 hours) within 72 hours of randomization. RESULTS:Participant median age was 15 months (interquartile range 10 to 26) and 59.4% (372/626) were male patients. Intravenous rehydration use was 12.1% (38/314) and 11.9% (37/312) in the placebo and ondansetron groups, respectively (odds ratio 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 1.61; difference 0.2%; 95% CI of the difference -4.9% to 5.4%).

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Cognitive impairments in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been associated with alterations in neuronal oscillatory activity, of which hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations are essential for the coordination of neuronal networks during cognitive functions. Cognitive deterioration in AD is delayed by symptomatic treatment with donepezil and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs). However, the efficacy of symptomatic monotherapy is insufficient. Combining 5-HT receptor antagonists with AChEIs represents a promising new approach for symptomatic treatment of AD. The selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron decreases the activity of interneurons with a concomitant increase in the activity of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Additionally, 5-HT3 receptor antagonism modulates acetylcholine release in rat cortex and hippocampus. We investigated the effects of ondansetron alone and in combination with donepezil on hippocampal oscillations using in vivo electrophysiology. Neuronal network oscillations were recorded in the dorsal hippocampus during electrical stimulation of the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus in urethane-anaesthetised rats. In addition, potential pharmacokinetic interactions between donepezil and ondansetron were assessed. Ondansetron alone did not affect hippocampal network oscillations. Donepezil dose-dependently increased hippocampal theta and gamma power during PPT stimulation. Ondansetron (0.3\u202fmg/kg, i.v.) potentiated theta and gamma responses to 0.2\u202fmg/kg donepezil and prolonged theta and gamma responses to 0.3\u202fmg/kg donepezil. These effects could not be attributed to pharmacokinetic interactions between the compounds. This study demonstrates that ondansetron potentiates the effects of donepezil on elicited neuronal oscillations and suggests that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may be beneficial as adjunctive therapy to AChEIs for the symptomatic treatment of cognitive deficits in AD."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Vomiting is not only unpleasant for both children and families, but can lead to frequent hospital admission. The persistent vomiting hampers oral intake and increases the risk of dehydration so the proper use of antiemetic drugs can be useful. The pharmacological treatment of vomiting in children remains a challenge for the pediatrician because several antiemetics are prescribed as \"off-label\", outside their authorized drug label. Domperidone and ondansetron are the most commonly known antiemetic drugs. A single oral dose of ondansetron has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent vomiting, the need for intravenous fluids and hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis. There is enough evidence to support ondansetron administration in children, so the clinical use can be defined as \"off-label/on evidence\". This review aims to provide an overview of therapeutic use, safety and main pharmacological properties of antiemetic drugs in children.

The aim of this analysis was to assess effectiveness of ondansetron for symptomatic treatment of carcinoid syndrome. DESIGN AND PATIENTS:We have analyzed patients given ondansetron as bridging therapy for refractory carcinoid syndrome. The dose was 2 \u00d7 8 mg for 5 days, followed by reduction to 1 \u00d7 8 mg in case of benefit. RESULTS:A total of 14 patients with small bowel NETs metastatic to the liver were identified. All patients had been treated with SSAs for a median time of 18 months before aggravation of diarrhea. One patient had to be excluded because of an underlying infectious cause of diarrhea. The median number of daily bowel movements was 7 (range, 5-13) before initiation of therapy. At this time, seven patients had stable disease, whereas six patients showed radiological progression with symptomatic breakthrough. All 13 patients were scheduled for salvage therapy. Remarkably, in 85% (11/13) ondansetron resulted in a clinically relevant decrease of bowel movements to a median of 3 (1-4). The median time of ondansetron intake was 29 days (7 days to 29 months). In four patients, diarrhea recurred after initial improvement at an interval of 22-43 days, whereas the remaining seven had an ongoing benefit, including two long-term responders who refused further therapy because of pronounced decrease of symptoms (ondansetron for 14+ and 29+ months). CONCLUSION:Ondansetron offers symptomatic relief in the majority of patients. Although there was no influence on 5-HIAA levels, evidence from two patients suggests prolonged benefit. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Somatostatin analogs are standard treatment in patients with carcinoid syndrome and have an overall response rate of up to 50%. This symptomatic benefit, however, is lost in many patients because of the development of tachyphylaxis or tumor progression. Patients with this \"refractory carcinoid syndrome\" pose a therapeutic challenge and are sometimes faced with a detrimental effect on quality of life. In this article, the authors suggest the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron as potential symptomatic therapy for patients with refractory diarrhea due to carcinoid syndrome. Although the number of patients in this retrospective series is limited, treatment was easily applicable, feasible, and safe and resulted in an ongoing symptomatic benefit in 85% of patients, including two long-term responders."}

We aimed to assess the effect of palonosetron and dexamethasone combination for these patients for prevention of PONV. Methods:This study included 2 groups and 150 patients. At the time of wound closure, patients in group A received ondansetron 8 mg intravenous (IV) + dexamethasone 4 mg IV and group B received palonosetron 0.075 mg IV + dexamethasone 4 mg IV. Postoperatively for 48 hours, group A patients received ondansetron 4 mg 8 hourly IV, group B patients received normal saline 8 hourly IV in 2 cc syringe. The primary objective was the overall incidence of PONV. Independent t-test, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used and multivariate regression analysis was done. Results:Vomiting was significantly higher in group A (37.3%) as compared with group B (21.3%) at 0-48 hours (P = 0.031). Significantly more patients in Group A had nausea as compared with group B at 90-120 minutes (30.66% vs 18.66%, P = 0.043) and 6-24 hours (32.0% vs 22.66%, P = 0.029). PCA opioid usage in microgram was significantly higher in group A at 0-24 hours (690.53 \u00b1 332.57 vs 576.85 \u00b1 250.79, P = 0.024) and 0-48 hours (1126.10 \u00b1 512.18 vs 952.13 \u00b1 353.85, P = 0.030).

During October and November 2015, emergency medicine pharmacists completed an educational initiative targeting medical and nursing staff designed to reduce prophylactic administration of ondansetron. The multifaceted educational initiative comprised of a link to an animated video, posters at strategic locations in the department, e-mail reminders, brief presentations during shift change, and 1-on-1 discussion (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvx8zKJBCCI). All patients who received IV morphine or hydromorphone during September and December 2015 were identified using pharmacy dispensing records, and 150 patients from each period were randomly selected for retrospective chart review. The primary outcome was the change in the proportion of prophylactic administration of ondansetron with IV opioids for acute pain in the emergency department.The proportion of patients administered prophylactic ondansetron decreased from 41% in the preintervention period to 26% in the postintervention period (difference 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.8 to 25.9, P\u00a0= 0.005). Therapeutic use for documented nausea or vomiting upon presentation decreased marginally from 44% to 35% (difference 95% CI\u00a0-2.3 to 19.7, P\u00a0= 0.1). An overall decrease in the incidence of administration of ondansetron from 85% to 61% was observed (difference 95% CI 14.4 to 33.6, P < 0.001). No patient required rescue antiemetic administration.Medical and nursing staff education yielded a significant reduction in the administration of prophylactic ondansetron for patients receiving IV opioids in the emergency department."}

The aim of this study is to determine the optimal dose of ondansetron required based on the patient's weight to reduce hypotension following spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. METHODS:In this prospective, triple-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, a total of 228 pregnant women were randomized to receive either normal saline (group NS) or ondansetron 0.05\u00a0mg/kg (group O1) or ondansetron 0.1\u00a0mg/kg (group O2) intravenously 5\u00a0min before induction of spinal anesthesia. The incidence of hypotension, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, vasopressor requirements, and blood loss between the three groups were compared. Maternal and neonatal complications were also assessed. Changes in blood pressure and heart rate were compared using the generalized estimating equations method. RESULTS:Thirteen patients were excluded from the analysis because of no intervention (n\u2009=\u200912) and protocol violation (n\u2009=\u20091). Two hundred and fifteen patients remained for the intention-to-treat analysis. The incidence of hypotension in groups NS (n\u2009=\u200972), O1 (n\u2009=\u200971), and O2 (n\u2009=\u200972) were 81.9%, 84.5%, and 73.6%, respectively (P\u2009=\u20090.23). The episodes of hypotension before delivery (first 14\u00a0min after spinal anesthesia) were significantly higher in group O1 compared to NS (5 vs 2, P\u2009=\u20090.02). The overall heart rates throughout the operations were not different among the three groups. The ephedrine requirements and amount of blood loss were also similar among the three groups. The metoclopramide requirement was significantly lower in group O2 compared to group NS (2.8% vs 16.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.01). There were no serious adverse events in terms of maternal or neonatal complications. CONCLUSIONS:Ondansetron 0.05\u00a0mg/kg or 0.1\u00a0mg/kg administered before spinal anesthesia did not reduce the incidence of hypotension in this study.

The incidence can be as high as 80% in high-risk patients. Our primary objective was to compare the efficacy of the combination of dexamethasone-ondansetron and dexamethasone-aprepitant in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Methods:Seventy 18 to 60 years old patients scheduled for laparoscopic surgery were included in the study. Sixty-seven patients completed the study. Patients in the dexamethasone-aprepitant group (group DA, n=35) received 40 mg of aprepitant orally 1-2 hours before the induction of anaesthesia and 2 mL saline intravenously (iv) within the last 30 minutes of surgery; patients in the dexamethasone-ondansetron group (group DO, n=35) received oral placebo identical to aprepitant 1-2 hours before the induction of anaesthesia and 4 mg ondansetron iv within the last 30 minutes of surgery. All patients received 8 mg dexamethasone iv after the induction of anaesthesia. The primary outcome was a complete response (no postoperative nausea, retching and vomiting and no need for rescue antiemetic); the secondary outcomes were the incidence of nausea, retching, vomiting, the need of rescue antiemetic and opioid consumption within 24 hours after surgery. Results:A complete response was not significantly different between the groups (group DO: 67%, DA: 69%) at 24 hours (p=0.93). The incidence of PONV and postoperative opioid consumption was similar between the groups. Conclusion:The study was designed to evaluate whether the combination of dexamethasone-aprepitant is better than the combination of dexamethasone-ondansetron regarding the complete response for PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The results however showed that dexamethasone-aprepitant has not improved the complete response for PONV compared to dexamethasone-ondansetron."}

The prevalence of ondansetron use for the treatment of first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy among control patients was calculated in 2-year intervals. Using women with untreated first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy as the reference, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for associations between first-trimester ondansetron use for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and specific birth defects. A secondary exposure group of other prescription antiemetics was used to address confounding by indication.In the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and Slone Birth Defects Study, respectively, 6,751 and 5,873 control mothers and 14,667 and 8,533 case mothers who reported first-trimester nausea and vomiting of pregnancy were included in the analysis. Among women in the control group, ondansetron exposure increased from less than 1% before 2000 to 13% in 2013-2014. Ondansetron use was not associated with an increased risk for most of the 51 defect groups analyzed. Modest increases in risk were observed for cleft palate (adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3) in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study and renal agenesis-dysgenesis (adjusted OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0) in the Birth Defects Study, although these findings may be the result of chance.Off-label use of ondansetron for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy increased to 13% by the end of the study period. For the majority of specific birth defects investigated, there was no increased risk associated with first-trimester use of ondansetron for treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy compared with no treatment, although modest associations with cleft palate and renal agenesis-dysgenesis warrant further study."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND Serotonin syndrome is a common yet potentially life-threatening condition caused by increased serotonergic activity, usually from serotonergic pharmaceutical agents. Primary features of serotonin syndrome include mental status changes, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. However, the presentation of serotonin syndrome is often quite variable, leading to its under-diagnosis. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old female with chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis presented to the Emergency Department with severe, diffuse body pain. Over the course of her hospital stay, she developed severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea followed by hyperreflexia and inducible clonus. Laboratory studies were remarkable for elevated liver transaminases. Review of her medications revealed several serotonergic agents, including duloxetine, tramadol, and ondansetron. Given her symptoms and the multiple serotonergic agents she was taking, she was diagnosed with serotonin syndrome. Discontinuation of the serotonergic agents led to resolution of her symptoms over the course of 4 days. CONCLUSIONS Our patient's initial presentation of diffuse body pain highlights the variable presentation of serotonin syndrome. Our case also demonstrates the importance of recognizing serotonin syndrome, as the supportive ondansetron we gave to alleviate her nausea and vomiting likely exacerbated her serotonin syndrome."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Several psychiatric disorders involve abnormalities of interoception and associated neural circuitry centered on the insula. The development of interventions modulating interoceptive circuits could lead to novel treatment approaches for these disorders. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron is a good candidate for the modulation of interoceptive circuits, as 5-HT3 receptors are located abundantly on sensory pathways and ondansetron has shown some clinical utility in disorders characterized by sensory and interoceptive abnormalities. The present study tested the ability of three different doses of ondansetron to engage neural regions involved in interoception to determine the drug's utility as a therapeutic agent to target circuit abnormalities in patients. Fifty-three healthy subjects were randomized to receive a single 8-mg (n\u2009=\u200918), 16-mg (n\u2009=\u200917), or 24-mg (n\u2009=\u200918) dose of ondansetron and placebo before MRI scanning on separate days. Subjects performed an fMRI task previously shown to engage interoceptive circuitry in which they viewed videos depicting body movements/sensation and control videos. The results revealed a highly significant relationship between dosage and activation in bilateral insula, somatosensory and premotor regions, cingulate cortex, and temporal cortex for control but not body-focused videos. These effects were driven by a robust reduction in activation for ondansetron compared to placebo for the 24-mg group, with weaker effects for the 16-mg and 8-mg groups. In conclusion, high-dose ondansetron reduces activation of several areas important for interoception, including insula and sensorimotor cortical regions. This study reveals the potential utility of this drug in modulating hyperactivity in these regions in patients."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is a distressing adverse effect. Neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA)-containing regimens are the standard regimens for CINV prophylaxis in patients with cancer receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC). NK1RA agents are expensive and were not registered in Sudan. Recently, regimens containing olanzapine, the available and affordable medication in Sudan, were introduced as another option. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of an olanzapine-containing regimen with the antiemetic regimen that was currently used in our institute for CINV prophylaxis in HEC/MEC settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS:The study prospectively compared an olanzapine-containing regimen (acute phase: olanzapine, ondansetron, dexamethasone; delayed phase: olanzapine, ondansetron) with an ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (acute phase: ondansetron, dexamethasone; delayed phase: ondansetron) in adult patients with cancer receiving HEC or MEC. The study outcomes were complete response (CR; no emesis and no rescue medications) and nausea control (no nausea), which were assessed in the acute (0 to 24 hours), delayed (24 to 120 hours), and overall (0 to 120 hours) phases. RESULTS:The study included 131 patients (olanzapine-containing: 50 patients; ondansetron/dexamethasone: 81 patients). CR and nausea control were higher in the olanzapine-containing than in the ondansetron/dexamethasone regimen (CR: acute phase, 86% v 71.6%; P = .086; delayed phase, 72% v 30.9%; P\u00a0< .001; overall phase, 66% v 25.9%; P\u00a0< .001; nausea control: acute phase, 86% v 74.1%; P = .127; delayed phase, 76% v 34.6%; P\u00a0< .001; overall phase, 72% v 29.6%; P\u00a0< .001). The major toxicity of olanzapine was grade 1 and 2 sedation or drowsiness (25 patients). CONCLUSION:An olanzapine-containing regimen has better efficacy for prevention of CINV in the HEC/MEC setting. Oncologists working in a limited-resource setting should be familiar with olanzapine-containing regimens, because NK1RA agents are not affordable and not easily available."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the prevalence of off-label and unlicensed prescribing in inpatients at a major paediatric teaching hospital in Western Australia and to identify which drugs are commonly prescribed off-label or unlicensed, including factors influencing such prescribing. METHODS:A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in June, 2013. Patient and prescribing data were collected from 190 inpatient medication chart records which had been randomly selected from all admissions during the second week of February 2013. Drugs were categorised as licensed, off-label or unlicensed, according to their approved Australian registration product information (PI). All drugs were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. RESULTS:There were 120 male and 70 female inpatients. The average age was 6.0 years (\u00b1 4.7). The study included 1160 prescribed drugs suitable for analysis. The number of drugs prescribed per patient ranged from 1 to 25 with an average of 6.1 (\u00b1 4.3). More than half (54%) were prescribed off-label. Oxycodone, clonidine, parecoxib and midazolam were always prescribed off-label. The most common off-label drugs were ondansetron (18.5%), fentanyl (12.9%), oxycodone (8.8%) and paracetamol (6.1%). Many ATC classifications included high off-label proportions especially the genitourinary system and sex hormones, respiratory system drugs, systemic hormonal preparations and alimentary tract and metabolism drugs. CONCLUSIONS:This study highlights that prescribing of paediatric drugs needs to be better supported by existing and new evidence. Incentives should be established to foster the conduct of evidence-based studies in the paediatric population. The current level of off-label prescribing raises issues of unexpected toxicity and adverse drug effects in children that are in some cases severely ill."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "The xylazine/ketamine anesthesia test is widely used as a predictor of the emetic potential of pharmacological compounds in rats. An emetic reflex is usually triggered by the emetic center, which is populated with many different chemoreceptors. Inhibition of the \u03b12 adrenergic receptor (\u03b12 receptor) is involved in the initiation of the emetic reflex, and this is the key mechanism behind the xylazine/ketamine anesthesia test. In this study, we attempt to validate this test as a predictor of the emetic potential of pharmacological compounds. Furthermore, it was investigated whether an anti-emetic potential of pharmacological compounds could be assessed within this test as well. Rats were anesthetized with a combination of low doses of ketamine and xylazine, and subsequently treated with PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, \u03b12 receptor antagonist yohimbine, \u03b12 receptor agonist clonidine, tricyclic antidepressant imipramine, D2-receptor antagonist haloperidol, or 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (and anti-emetic drug) ondansetron. We were able to successfully reproduce the reduction in anesthesia time after rolipram or yohimbine treatment, as found in previous studies and has been suggested to be indicative of emetic properties of these treatments is humans. Furthermore, clonidine shortened anesthesia duration whereas imipramine and haloperidol lengthened anesthesia duration. Ondansetron was unable to rescue the reduction in duration of anesthesia induced by either rolipram or yohimbine. Altogether, the xylazine/ketamine anesthesia test is a reliable measure for \u03b12 receptor antagonism. However, it may not be appropriate to assess emesis independent of this mechanism."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Fosaprepitant is a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, approved for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The data on the use of fosaprepitant in children are limited and therefore we conducted a phase III randomized controlled trial. PROCEDURE:Children aged 1-12\u00a0years scheduled to receive moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were randomly assigned to arm-A (fosaprepitant) or arm-B (placebo). Children recruited to arm-A received intravenous ondansetron plus dexamethasone followed by fosaprepitant infusion. Children recruited to arm-B received the same drugs as those given to children in arm-A, except that fosaprepitant was substituted with a placebo. Ondansetron and dexamethasone were continued for 48 hours after completion of chemotherapy. The primary end point of the study was to determine the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR), defined as no vomiting, no retching, and no use of rescue medication, during the 24-120\u00a0hours (delayed phase) after administration of the last dose of chemotherapy. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients who achieved a CR during the acute phase (0-24\u00a0hours) and overall after administration of the last dose of chemotherapy. RESULTS:One-hundred-sixty-three patients were analyzed (81 in the fosaprepitant arm and 82 in the placebo arm). CR rates were significantly higher in the fosaprepitant arm compared to those in the placebo arm during the acute phase (86% vs 60%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), delayed phase (79% vs 51%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and overall phase (70% vs 41%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Three (4%) patients in the fosaprepitant arm and sixteen (20%) in the placebo arm required rescue anti-emetics (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0017). CONCLUSION:Addition of fosaprepitant to ondansetron and dexamethasone improved chemotherapy-induced vomiting control in children treated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy."}

Chronic pain states are frequently associated with enhanced descending excitatory drive mediated predominantly through serotonergic neurones in the rostral ventromedial medulla. In this study, we examine the roles of spinal 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors in modulating ascending sensory output in normal and neuropathic states. In vivo electrophysiology was performed in anaesthetised spinal nerve ligated (SNL) and sham-operated rats to record from wide dynamic range neurones in the ventral posterolateral thalamus. In sham rats, block of spinal 5-HT3Rs with ondansetron revealed tonic facilitation of noxious punctate mechanical stimulation, whereas blocking 5-HT2ARs with ketanserin had minimal effect on neuronal responses to evoked stimuli. The inhibitory profiles of both drugs were altered in SNL rats; ondansetron additionally inhibited neuronal responses to lower intensity punctate mechanical stimuli and noxious heat evoked responses, whereas ketanserin inhibited innocuous and noxious evaporative cooling evoked responses. Neither drug had any effect on dynamic brush evoked responses nor on spontaneous firing rates in both sham and SNL rats. These data identify novel modality and intensity selective facilitatory roles of spinal 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors on sensory neuronal processing within the spinothalamic-somatosensory cortical pathway."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "RATIONALE:Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) are gut derived hormones. GLP-1 and GLP-2 were shown to have pleiotropic effects in intestinal and pancreatic diseases. OBJECTIVE:We aimed to investigate the activities of GLP-1 and GLP-2 on nociception and inflammation in mice, involving their actions on serotonergic, nitrergic, and opioidergic systems. METHODS:Antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of intraperitoneally injected GLPs were evaluated in hotplate latency test, formalin-induced behavioral, and paw edema tests. Ondansetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; L-NAME, a NOS inhibitor; and naloxone, an opioid antagonist were injected to determine the mechanisms of antinociception and anti-inflammation. We also measured blood glucose levels and performed rotarod test in order to evaluate whether the hypoglycemic effect of GLP compounds or alterations in locomotor activity may affect the latency in hotplate test and activity in formalin test. RESULTS:GLP-1 (0.2\u00a0mg/kg) and GLP-2 (0.05, 0.2\u00a0mg/kg) significantly increased pain threshold. GLP-1 (0.2\u00a0mg/kg) and GLP-2 (0.05, 0.1, 0.2\u00a0mg/kg) significantly decreased formalin-induced licking and shaking behaviors. GLP-1 or GLP-2 showed no significant inhibitory action on formalin-induced swelling in paws of mice. Antinociceptive actions of GLP-1 and GLP-2 were significantly decreased with ondansetron and naloxone, and paw shaking behavior significantly increased with naloxone. GLP-1 and GLP-2 did not impair rotarod performance, and did not cause a significant hypoglycemic effect in our normoglycemic mice after rotarod test. CONCLUSION:These finding indicated that the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect of GLP-1 was related to opioidergic system. Antinociceptive effect of GLP-2 was partially related to 5-HT3 serotonergic or opioidergic system in hotplate test. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of GLP-2 was not directly related to 5-HT3, NO or opioids."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Though the advancement of chemotherapy drugs alleviates the progress of cancer, long-term therapy with anticancer agents gradually leads to acquired multidrug resistance (MDR), which limits the survival outcomes in patients. It was shown that dihydromyricetin (DMY) could partly reverse MDR by suppressing P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and soluble resistance-related calcium-binding protein (SORCIN) independently. To reverse MDR more effectively, a new strategy was raised, that is, circumventing MDR by the coadministration of DMY and ondansetron (OND), a common antiemetic drug, during cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, the interior relation between P-gp and SORCIN was also revealed. The combination of DMY and OND strongly enhanced antiproliferative efficiency of adriamycin (ADR) because of the increasing accumulation of ADR in K562/ADR-resistant cell line. DMY could downregulate the expression of SORCIN and P-gp via the ERK/Akt pathways, whereas OND could not. In addition, it was proved that SORCIN suppressed ERK and Akt to inhibit P-gp by the silence of SORCIN, however, not vice versa. Finally, the combination of DMY, OND, and ADR led to G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via resuming P53 function and restraining relevant proteins expression. These fundamental findings provided a promising approach for further treatment of MDR."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Objective:5-HT3 receptor antagonist (ondansetron) has been reported to have nephrotoxic effect when combined with cisplatin in mice; however, little evidence exists in explaining its nephrotoxic effects on patients. The aim of this present study was to investigate whether 5-HT3 receptor antagonist could enhance or aggravate the incidence of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in patients. Methods:We retrospectively reviewed 600 tumor patients which were treated with cisplatin (\u2a7e60\u2009mg/m2) as a first-time chemotherapy and combined with 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (i.e., ondansetron, tropisetron, or ramosetron, each kind of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist contains 200 cases) between January 2010 and December 2015. Cisplatin dosing, the baseline creatinine clearance, and other independent risk factors such as patient's age, sex, PS score, and weight associated with nephrotoxicity were evaluated in a multivariable model. Results:The incidence of Grade \u2a7e 2 serum creatinine elevation in cisplatin + ondansetron group was significantly higher than cisplatin + tropisetron group (P = 0.04), but no significant difference was found between cisplatin + ondansetron group and cisplatin + ramosetron group (P = 0.3). It was also found that cisplatin dosage and tumor type were independent risk factors in the development of nephrotoxicity. Conclusion:Higher cisplatin dosage and regular use of ondansetron combined with cisplatin are more likely to increase the incidence of nephrotoxicity; tropisetron showed the relatively mild effect on kidney function, suggesting that tropisetron is a preferable alternative in the process of cisplatin chemotherapy."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Neuroactive steroids (NS) such as allopregnanolone are crucial for brain development and adult behaviour. Early post-natal alterations of NS by administering finasteride induce a decrease in the sensitivity to stimulant effects of low alcohol doses, an increase in alcohol consumption, and a decrease in ventrostriatal dopamine and serotonin levels. The aim of the present study is to observe if the effects of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron on initial alcohol consumption are modulated by post-natal NS manipulation. For this purpose, allopregnanolone, finasteride, or vehicle was injected from day 5 to 9. In adulthood, a novel object preference test was carried out in order to detect a possible novelty-seeking pattern in our animals, which has been related to vulnerability to drug abuse. The subjects then had access to two bottles (alcohol or control solutions) one hour daily for two consecutive weeks. Ondansetron (0.01\u202fmg/kg, 0.1\u202fmg/kg or vehicle) was administered before the hour of consumption in the initial phase (days 1, 2, 3) of the procedure, and after prolonged alcohol intake (days 11, 12, 13). Results indicated that finasteride animals showed a higher preference to explore the new object, as well as a higher alcohol consumption than the rest of the groups. Moreover, 0.1\u202fmg/kg of ondansetron decreased alcohol consumption, but only in the post-natal finasteride group, suggesting a possible increase in 5HT3 receptor sensitivity in these animals. In conclusion, NS manipulation in crucial stages of development, such as early post-natal periods, seems to play an important role on the effects of ondansetron on alcohol intake and in the vulnerability to develop drug use or abuse."}

This method procedure for the analysis of OND, GRA and TRO was involved of extracting samples with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) solid phase extraction (SPE) and determination by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy. An SPE method for the simultaneous extraction of OND, GRA and TRO with high efficiency and selectivity was developed. Prior to HPLC-MS/MS analysis, most of the sources of interference present in the supernatant after protein precipitation of plasma proteins was efficiently removed from the samples by the HILIC SPE treatment. For the quantification of OND, GRA and TRO in the samples, tandem mass spectrometry operating in positive electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring was used. The calibration curve was performed in the range of 0.2-20\u202fng/mL for the target OND, GRA and TRO in goat plasma samples. The precision of the intra- and inter-day assay for OND, GRA and TRO were 1.84-6.23% and 3.89-5.31%, 2.63-6.29% and 3.76-5.31%, 1.99-5.67% and 2.64-4.70%, respectively.

All medications administered in the 24\u202fh prior to admission were recorded and the QT-interval was measured upon ICU admission and corrected with Bazzet's formula (QTc). Drug-drug interactions involving drugs potentially associated with QTc prolongation (DDIQT) were searched and QTc increase associated with pharmacokinetic (PK-DDIQT) and pharmacodynamic (PD-DDIQT) interactions was assessed with multiple regression adjusted by patient varibles. Results:The study population consisted of 283 patients, 54.4% males, mean age 57.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f16.7\u202fyears-old. Forty five (15.9%) patients presented 65 DDIQT with predominance of pharmacodynamic (66.1%). The risk of DDIQT prescription increased with lower systolic blood pressure, in hypokalemia, in non-diabetics and with the number of medications. PK-DDIQT alone did not affect the QTc interval (7.75\u202fms, 95%CI: -22.4 to 37.9\u202fms, p\u202f=\u202f0.61), but PD-DDIQT increased QTc by 28.4\u202fms (95%CI: 9.67 to 47.4\u202fms, p\u202f=\u202f0.003). Most PD-DDIQT involved metoclopramide with ondansetron or amiodarone, and ondansetron with ciprofloxacin.

Group T received 10 mg/h tramadol as infusion. Hemodynamic parameters along with pain assessment using Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) were analyzed at 0, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Rescue analgesia was administered if VRS >4. Side effects were noted by condition scoring criteria (CSC) scale.Rescue analgesia was administered at 3 h, for three patients in T+O Group and 1 patient in T Group, but this is not statistically significant (P = 0.153). No rescue analgesia was required in both the groups at any other point of time.

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:The organic cation transporters (OCTs) and multidrug and toxin extrusions (MATEs) together are regarded as an organic cation transport system critical to the disposition and response of many organic cationic drugs. Patient response to the analgesic morphine, a characterized substrate for human OCT1, is highly variable. This study was aimed to examine whether there is any organic cation transporter-mediated drug and drug interaction (DDI) between morphine and commonly co-administrated drugs. METHODS:The uptake of morphine and its inhibition by six drugs which are commonly co-administered with morphine in the clinic were assessed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells stably expressing OCT1, OCT2 and MATE1. The in vivo interaction between morphine and the select irinotecan was determined by comparing the disposition of morphine in the absence versus presence of irinotecan treatment in mice. RESULTS:The uptake of morphine in the stable HEK293 cells expressing human OCT1 and OCT2 was significantly increased by 3.56 and 3.04 fold, respectively, than that in the control cells, with no significant uptake increase in the cells expressing human MATE1. All of the six drugs examined, including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, imipramine, irinotecan, ondansetron, and verapamil, were inhibitors of OCT1/2-mediated morphine uptake. The select irinotecan significantly increased the plasma concentrations and decreased hepatic and renal accumulation of morphine in mice. CONCLUSIONS:Morphine is a substrate of OCT1 and OCT2. Clinician should be aware that the disposition of and thus the response to morphine may be altered by co-administration of an OCT1/2 inhibitor, such as irinotecan."}

IKAS importantly contributes to cardiac repolarization in conditions associated with reduced repolarization reserve. To test the hypothesis that IKAS inhibition contributes to drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS), we screened for KCNN variants among patients with diLQTS, determined the properties of heterologously expressed wild-type (WT) and variant KCNN channels, and determined if the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron blocks IKAS. We searched 2,306,335 records in the Indiana Network for Patient Care and found 11 patients with diLQTS who had DNA available in the Indiana Biobank. DNA sequencing discovered a heterozygous KCNN2 variant (p.F503L) in a 52-yr-old woman presenting with corrected QT interval prolongation at baseline (473 ms) and further corrected QT interval lengthening (601 ms) after oral administration of ondansetron. That patient was also heterozygous for the p.S38G and p.P2835S variants of the QT-controlling genes KCNE1 and ankyrin 2, respectively. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that the p.F503L KCNN2 variant heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells augmented Ca2+ sensitivity, increasing IKAS density. The fraction of total F503L-KCNN2 protein retained in the membrane was higher than that of WT KCNN2 protein. Ondansetron at nanomolar concentrations inhibited WT and p.F503L SK2 channels expressed in HEK-293 cells as well as native SK channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes. Ondansetron-induced IKAS inhibition was also demonstrated in Langendorff-perfused murine hearts. In conclusion, the heterozygous p.F503L KCNN2 variant increases Ca2+ sensitivity and IKAS density in transfected HEK-293 cells. Ondansetron at therapeutic (i.e., nanomolar) concentrations is a potent IKAS blocker. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We showed that ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, blocks small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) current. Ondansetron may be useful in controlling arrhythmias in which increased SK current is a likely contributor. However, its SK-blocking effects may also facilitate the development of drug-induced long QT syndrome."}

During the acute phase, complete responses were recorded in 72.2% (39/54) and 83.3% (45/54) receiving ondansetron and palonosetron, respectively (\u0394CR +\u200911.1%). The lower limit of 97.5% confidence interval (-\u20096.95-28.39) for this difference was greater than -\u200915% in palonosetron arm. Only statistically significant risk factor that predisposed response was use of dexamethasone (p value <\u20090.01). The cost associated with ondansetron administration was significantly higher compared to palonosetron. CONCLUSION:Palonosetron is non-inferior and cost-effective compared to ondansetron for prevention of acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting (CIV) in children receiving moderate and high emetogenic chemotherapy."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:Results of a study to determine whether i.v. administration of a single dose of 4 mg of ondansetron was associated with QT interval prolongation in emergency department (ED) patients are reported. METHODS:In a prospective observational study conducted at an urban academic medical center ED, a convenience sample of adult ED patients treated with ondansetron 4 mg i.v. were enrolled. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained immediately before and 5 minutes after ondansetron administration. Measurements of heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc measurements) provided by ECG machines were evaluated. An electrophysiologist analyzed all ECGs for adverse electrical events and verified the accuracy of QTc values. The primary objective was to measure the QTc change from baseline after ondansetron administration. The secondary objective was to describe adverse electrical cardiac events. Interactions between ondansetron and patients' home medications or ED-provided medications were analyzed. RESULTS:Among patients included in the data analysis (n = 20), ondansetron administration was associated with a mean QTc increase of 16.2 msec (95% confidence interval, 4.2-28.2 msec; p = 0.01) and a median increase of 12 msec (interquartile range, 5.5-18.0 msec; p < 0.01). One patient had a significant cardiac event (pulseless electrical activity) that was likely unrelated to ondansetron use. The home medications of 9 patients (42.9%) were deemed to pose a risk of torsades de pointes, and 17 major QT-prolonging drug-drug interactions were identified.

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Background: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of hospital admissions, prolonged hospital stays, morbidity, and drug-related mortality. In this study, we sought to identify the most frequently reported medications and associated side effects in adolescent-aged patients in an effort to prioritize clinical pharmacology consultation efforts for hospitals seeking to improve patient safety. \u00a0 Methods: Quarterly reported data were obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) from the third quarter of 2014 and ending in the third quarter of 2017. We then used the GeneCards database to map the pharmacogenomic biomarkers associated with the most reported FAERS drugs. Data homogenization and statistics analysis were all conducted in R for statistical programming. Results: We identified risperidone (10.64%) as the compound with the most reported ADRs from all reported cases. Males represented 90.1% of reported risperidone cases with gynecomastia being the most reported ADR. Ibuprofen OR=188 (95% CI, 105.00 \u2013 335.00) and quetiapine fumarate OR=116 (95% CI, 48.40 \u2013 278.00) were associated with the highest odds of completed suicide in teenagers. Ondansetron hydrochloride OR=7.12 (95% CI, 1.59 \u2013 31.9) resulted in the highest odds of pneumothorax. Lastly, olanzapine (8.96%) represented the compound with the most reported drug-drug interactions cases, while valproic acid OR=221 (95% CI, 93.900 \u2013 522.00) was associated with the highest odds of drug-drug interactions. Conclusion: Despite any data limitations, physicians prescribing risperidone in males should be aware of the high rates of adverse drug events and an alternative psychotropic should be considered in male patients. Further, patients with a history of pneumothorax or genetically predisposed to pneumothorax should be considered for an alternative antiemetic to ondansetron hydrochloride, due to increased odds associated with the drug and adverse event."}

We reported the use of droperidol in the management of CHS. METHODS:We performed a retrospective review of electronic medical records of Emergency Department presentations to a single tertiary level metropolitan hospital between January 2006 and December 2016 using search keywords: \"cannabis\", \"cannabinoid\", \"cannabis\", \"hyperemesis\", and \"droperidol\". A secondary search of pharmacy droperidol dispensing records was cross matched with electronic medical record data. We reviewed each record to determine if the presentation met previously published diagnostic criteria for CHS. Data were dichotomised into presentations with droperidol administered or not administered. The primary outcome was defined as the total length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes measures included time until discharge following last drug administration, and the total number of antiemetic dosages administered. RESULTS:Six-hundred and eighty-nine records were identified and 76 met CHS diagnostic criteria. Thirty-seven presentations were treated with droperidol and 39 were not. Droperidol treatment group median length of stay was significantly lower compared to the no droperidol treatment group (6.7 vs. 13.9\u2009hours, p\u2009=\u2009.014). Median time to discharge after final drug administration in the droperidol treatment group was 137\u2009minutes (IQR 65, 203) vs. the no droperidol treatment group of 185\u2009minutes (IQR 149, 403). The most frequent dosage of droperidol used was 0.625mg intravenously. The frequency of ondansetron (n\u2009=\u2009100) and metoclopramide (n\u2009=\u200927) in the no droperidol treatment group was double that of the droperidol group. CONCLUSIONS:Use of droperidol to treat CHS associated nausea and vomiting resulted in less overall use of antiemetics and reduced length of stay."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:Fosaprepitant improved prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in a randomized, double-blind phase III trial (PN031). This post hoc analysis explored factors that may have influenced response. METHODS:Adult subjects (N\u2009=\u20091000) scheduled to receive non-anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) on day 1 were randomly assigned 1:1 to a single-dose, 150-mg intravenous fosaprepitant regimen or a control regimen. Both regimens included dexamethasone and ondansetron on day 1, with ondansetron continuing through day 3 in the control arm only. Complete response (CR; no vomiting and no rescue medication) rates in the acute, delayed, and overall phases (0-25, 25-120, and 0-120\u00a0h, respectively) were analyzed by chemotherapy type (carboplatin-based vs non-carboplatin-based), chemotherapy duration (single-day vs multiple-day), and baseline characteristics. RESULTS:Most subjects received single-day chemotherapeutic regimens (70.6%), which were mainly carboplatin-based (67.6%). CR with fosaprepitant was consistent (76-80%) during the delayed and overall phases in carboplatin-based and non-carboplatin-based subgroups and in subgroups receiving single-day or multiple-day MEC regimens. Treatment effects favored fosaprepitant for the carboplatin-based versus the non-carboplatin-based group during the delayed phase (14.1 vs 6.5%; p\u2009=\u20090.06), and for the single-day versus the multiple-day subgroup during the delayed (13.2 vs 3.2%; p\u2009=\u20090.02) and overall phases (12.8 vs 4.0%; p\u2009=\u20090.06). CONCLUSIONS:This exploratory analysis confirms that single-dose fosaprepitant is effective for the prevention of CINV in subjects receiving carboplatin or non-carboplatin in both single- and multiple-day non-AC MEC chemotherapy regimens.

Selection of antiemetic agents to prevent CINV should be based on an evaluation of their efficacy and safety. This systematic review and meta-analysis describes the adverse effects associated with antiemetic agents recommended for the prevention of acute CINV in children by clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Areas covered: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases to identify papers describing adverse effects in pediatric patients receiving aprepitant, dexamethasone, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, or tropisetron. Meta-analysis was conducted for adverse effects reported in at least three prospective studies with a cumulative incidence of at least 1%. Expert opinion: Antiemetic agents currently recommended by CPGs are relatively safe to use in children. The presence of patient-specific risk factors for rare adverse effects, especially cardiac arrhythmia, should be evaluated when selecting a patient's antiemetic therapy. Evaluation of the long-term safety of CPG-recommended antiemetic agents in pediatric cancer patients is needed."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Perioperative shivering during cesarean sections (CSs) under neuraxial anesthesia (NA) is clinically common but often under-treated. It may prominently increase oxygen consumption, which can be catastrophic for parturients with ischemic cardiovascular disease. Thus, the prevention and treatment of shivering may be of great significance in parturients. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the effectiveness of several drugs on shivering prevention and treatment during CSs under NA.A literature search was carried out using PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant studies. After literature screening and information extraction, a systematic review was performed.Eighteen randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Intrathecal dexmedetomidine effectively reduced shivering, but effectiveness depended on the dose administered. Intrathecal fentanyl, intrathecal sufentanil, intrathecal meperidine, intravenous ketamine and intravenous tramadol were beneficial for reducing shivering during CSs under NA. MgSO4 administered intrathecally resulted in transient alleviation of shivering, and the effect did not persist. Two trials investigated the antishivering effect of intravenous ondansetron. The medication appeared to be effective in one trial, but ineffective in the other.Appropriate use of dexmedetomidine, fentanyl, sufentanil, ketamine, meperidine, tramadol and MgSO4 may effectively reduce the incidence and severity of shivering during CSs under NA, while trials on the effect of intravenous ondansetron reached inconclusive results."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "RATIONALE:Impulsive choice has often been evaluated in rodents according to the proportion of choices for the delayed large magnitude reinforcer (%large choice) in a delay-discounting task (DDT). However, because %large choice is influenced by both sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude and sensitivity to delayed reinforcement (i.e., discounting rate), distinctively evaluating such discounting parameters represents a critical issue demanding methods to determine each parameter in rats. The serotonin (5-HT) system is well known to be involved in impulsive choice; nevertheless, only a few studies have distinguished discounting parameters and investigated how 5-HT modulators affect discounting rate. OBJECTIVE:Here, we performed a discounting parameter analysis in mice and examined the effects of various 5-HT modulators on discounting rate. METHODS:We set up DDTs with different delay schedules to determine which schedule could address delay-discounting rates in mice. We examined the effect of the following drugs on impulsive choice: a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT), and two 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (granisetron and ondansetron). RESULTS:Mice showed typical delay discounting at the shorter delay schedules (up to 4\u00a0s delay). The %large choice under shorter, but not longer, schedules followed an exponential function and allowed us to derive discounting rates. We selected a DDT with a 4-s delay schedule for further experiments. Granisetron and ondansetron, but not paroxetine or 8-OH-DPAT, decreased discounting rates without affecting sensitivity to reinforcer magnitude. CONCLUSION:We found that a method to calculate discounting rates in rats is also applicable to mouse models. We also provided evidence that 5-HT3 antagonism controls impulsive choice in mice."}

The incidence of hypotension, cumulative episodes of hypotension, total norepinephrine consumption, and adverse effects were recorded.There was no significant difference between the two groups in demographic data, parturient characteristics, and duration of surgery. No significant difference was found in the incidence of hypotension in the saline and ondansetron groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.767). However, the cumulative episodes of hypotension and norepinephrine consumptions were significantly greater in group S than in group O (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). There was also no significant difference in the incidence of adverse effects between the two groups.Eight milligrams of intravenous ondansetron given 5\u00a0min before spinal anesthesia attenuated but did not prevent spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension in parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery."}

Towards utilising these drugs as anti-smoking agents to treat nicotine dependence problem, there are conflicting reports regarding the potential of these ligands in modulating the effects of nicotine in both human and animal behavioural studies.

Patients allocated to three groups of intravenous ondansetron (O) (4 mg, 5 min),intramuscular ephedrine (E) (25 mg, 25 min) and ringer (R) (500 ml, 20 min) prior to spinal anaesthesia. Anaesthesia inducted with 10-15 mg of bupivacaine. Vital signs were recorded every 3 minutes for 18 minutes including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse rate (PR), pulse oximetry (SpO\u2082). RESULTS:Ninety patients with a mean age of 29.4 \u00b1 5.4 years were studied in three groups of O (n = 30), E (n = 30), R (n = 30). Results showed a statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of hypotension 12 minutes after spinal anaesthesia in the three groups, but no statistically significant difference was found in the rest of minutes among the three groups.

Our aim is to assess whether ondansetron used preventatively reduces the incidence of vomiting associated with intranasal fentanyl and N2O for procedural sedation compared with placebo.This study is a double blind, randomised placebo-controlled superiority trial. This is a single-centre trial of 442 children aged 3-18 years presenting to a tertiary care Paediatric Emergency Department at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH), Melbourne, Australia, requiring procedural sedation with intranasal fentanyl and N2O. After written consent, eligible participants are randomised to receive ondansetron or placebo along with intranasal fentanyl, 30-60\u2009min prior to N2O administration. The primary outcome is vomiting during or up to 1\u2009hour after procedural sedation.

However, the conventional method of ODF preparation using a film applicator may limit its application, due to content uniformity challenges arising from viscosity changes of the casting solution and varied operator manipulation. This study proposes the unit-dose (UD) plate as an alternative to the film applicator for compounding individual ODFs. Using a design-of-experiments approach, we developed an extemporaneous ODF formulation for an antiemetic drug, ondansetron hydrochloride dihydrate (OND), at a clinically relevant dose. ODFs cast with the UD plate showed excellent content uniformity independent of the viscosity of the casting solution and drug concentration. Formulations were evaluated for performance with respect to patient acceptability and product quality. The effects of critical process parameters on critical quality attributes of the ODF were studied. HPMC concentration and volume of casting solution were the main factors affecting disintegration time and mechanical properties of the film, while drug concentration had no significant effect. However, further studies incorporating different drugs in larger concentration ranges are needed to investigate the impact of drug concentration and to establish a design space. Nevertheless, our results indicate the potential of using the UD plate to prepare ODFs with customized drug doses from a generic casting solution. Results from this study provide a framework for an extemporaneous ODF platform."}

A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to compare the addition of olanzapine to triplet therapy (fosaprepitant, ondansetron, dexamethasone [FOND-O]) versus triplet therapy alone (FOND) in preventing CINV in hematology patients receiving single-day and multiple-day highly emetogenic chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) regimens (NCT02635984). The primary objective of this study was to compare complete response (CR; no emesis and minimal nausea, <25 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale) during the overall assessment period (chemotherapy days plus 5 days after). Secondary objectives were the number of emesis, number of rescue medications, percent achieving minimal nausea, and percent achieving complete protection (CP; no emesis, rescue antiemetic, or significant nausea), all of which are reported as acute (chemotherapy days), delayed (5 days after chemotherapy), and overall phases. Olanzapine 10 mg or matching placebo were given on each chemotherapy day and 3 days after. Adults with hematologic malignancy receiving HCT regimens of melphalan, BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan), busulfan (Bu)/cyclophosphamide (Cy), Bu/fludarabine (Flu), Bu/melphalan, FluCy, FluCy-total body irradiation (TBI), etoposide-TBI, and ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) or 7+3 chemotherapy regimens were included. An estimated 98 patients were required using alpha = .05 and 80% power. No significant differences existed in baseline characteristics between FOND-O (n\u202f=\u202f51) and FOND (n\u202f=\u202f50) arms. Mean duration of olanzapine was 7.7 days (range, 4 to 11). Discontinuation for possible adverse events occurred in 3 placebo and 0 olanzapine patients. CR was significantly higher for FOND-O in overall (55% versus 26%, P\u202f=\u202f.003) and delayed (60.8% versus 30%, P\u202f=\u202f.001) but not acute (P\u202f=\u202f.13) phases. Significantly more patients receiving FOND-O achieved no more than minimal nausea in overall (P\u202f=\u202f.001) and delayed phases (P\u202f=\u202f.0002), as well as fewer overall mean emesis counts (P\u202f=\u202f.005). CP rates were not different in any assessment phase (P \u2265 .05 each). Within the HCT subgroup (n\u202f=\u202f64), the CR, CP, and no significant nausea rates were significantly better for FONDO-O in overall and delayed phases (all P < .05). Analysis within the HCT subgroup revealed significant improvement in outcomes in delayed and overall phases with FOND-O in the autologous but not allogeneic cohort. Addition of olanzapine to an NK-1-based triplet antiemetic regimen significantly improved clinically relevant outcomes in the HCT population."}

In this study, we sought to identify the most frequently reported medications and associated side effects in adolescent-aged patients in an effort to prioritize clinical pharmacology consultation efforts for hospitals seeking to improve patient safety. \u00a0 Methods: Quarterly reported data were obtained from the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS) from the third quarter of 2014 and ending in the third quarter of 2017. We then used the GeneCards database to map the pharmacogenomic biomarkers associated with the most reported FAERS drugs. Data homogenization and statistics analysis were all conducted in R for statistical programming. Results: We identified risperidone (10.64%) as the compound with the most reported ADRs from all reported cases. Males represented 90.1% of reported risperidone cases with gynecomastia being the most reported ADR. Ibuprofen OR=188 (95% CI, 105.0000 \u2013 335.000) and quetiapine fumarate OR=116 (95% CI, 48.4000 \u2013 278.000) were associated with the highest odds of completed suicide in teenagers. Ondansetron hydrochloride OR=7.12 (95% CI, 1.59 \u2013 31.9) resulted in the highest odds of pneumothorax. Lastly, olanzapine (8.96%) represented the compound with the most reported drug-drug interactions cases, while valproic acid OR=221 (95% CI, 93.9000 \u2013 522.000) was associated with the highest odds of drug-drug interactions. Conclusion: Despite any data limitations, physicians prescribing risperidone in males should be aware of the high rates of adverse drug events and an alternative psychotropic should be considered in male patients. Further, patients with a history of pneumothorax or genetically predisposed to pneumothorax should be considered for an alternative antiemetic to ondansetron hydrochloride, due to increased odds associated with the drug and adverse event."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:The aim of the study was to describe clinical, epidemiological, and management characteristics of food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) cases in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Multicenter observational retrospective study. FPIES cases diagnosed in specialized units in Spain over 12 months in 2017 (January-December) according to the recently published international diagnostic criteria were included. RESULTS:One hundred twenty patients (53.3% boys) were included. The majority were acute cases (111) with mild-to-moderate severity (76.7%). Triggering foods were cow's milk (48/120), fish (38), egg (13), rice (12), and soy (1). The majority (84.2%) of the patients had FPIES to 1 food only. In addition to vomiting (100%), pallor (89.2%), and altered behavior (88.3%) were most frequently observed in acute forms. On the contrary, diarrhea (70%), abdominal distension (33.3%), and blood in stools (44.4%) were more frequently observed in chronic cases. Oral challenge was performed in 18.9% of the acute forms compared to 44.4% of the chronic forms. The most common treatment was intravenous fluids followed by ondansetron. Corticosteroids were used in 6 patients (5 with acute symptoms and 1 chronic). Seven patients were treated with antibiotics for suspicion of infection. Most cases of cow's milk FPIES were treated with extensively hydrolyzed formulas (69.8%). CONCLUSIONS:FPIES is not uncommon in our units. Unlike other published series, fish and egg are important triggers in our country. A greater knowledge and diffusion of the international consensus criteria will allow a better characterization of the cases and a standardization of their management."}

We evaluated the rates of ondansetron use during the study period and of the association of ondansetron treatment with the diagnosis of intracranial injury, skull fracture, and return visits within 72 hours requiring admission or operative intervention.We identified 218,904 encounters during the study period. Of these, 5894 patients (2.8%) were given ondansetron. There was significant variation in the use of ondansetron during the index visit between hospitals (0.1%-5.7%), and ondansetron use significantly increased over the study period. Return visits within 72 hours were more likely for patients treated with ondansetron during the index visit (3.7% vs 1.9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-2.4). These patients were more likely to be admitted than those not treated initially with ondansetron (7% vs 4%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.97; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-3.55). There were no significant differences in rates of skull fractures, intracranial injury, intensive care unit admission, or operative intervention between groups.Ondansetron use during an initial emergency department visit for head trauma in children not requiring neuroimaging is associated with a higher likelihood of return within 72 hours and subsequent admission. There were no differences in rates of missed skull fractures, intracranial injury, intensive care admission, or operative intervention for groups who were and were not treated with ondansetron; however, this study was underpowered to detect significant differences in these categories.

The patient admitted to injecting a suspension of crushed ondansetron (Zofran) tablets into the antecubital area to control post-operative nausea. It is known that direct intravascular injection of foreign material can cause distal ischemia and necrosis, either by local vasoconstriction, thrombosis, or formation of microemboli, as in this patient.

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Previously, we showed that the synthetic nitroderivative trans-4-methyl-\u03b2-nitrostyrene (T4MeN) induced vasorelaxant effects in rat isolated aortic rings. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of T4MeN in normotensive rats. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, intravenous (i.v.) injection of T4MeN (0.03-0.5\u202fmg/kg) induced a rapid (onset time of 1-2\u202fs) and dose-dependent bradycardia and hypotension. These cardiovascular responses to T4MeN were abolished by bilateral cervical vagotomy or selective blockade of neural conduction of vagal C-fiber afferents by perineural treatment of both cervical vagus nerves with capsaicin. Hypotension and bradycardia were also recorded when T4MeN was directly injected in the right, but not into the left ventricle. Furthermore, they were significantly reduced by i.v. pretreatment with capsazepine but remained unaltered by ondansetron or suramin. In conscious rats, the dose-dependent hypotension and bradycardia evoked by T4MeN were abolished by i.v. methylatropine pretreatment. In conclusion, bradycardiac and depressor responses induced by T4MeN has a vago-vagal reflex origin resulting from the vagal pulmonary afferents stimulation. The transduction mechanism seems to involve the activation of vanilloid \ufeffTRPV1, but not purinergic (P2X) or 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal pulmonary sensory nerves."}

RevMan 5.0 and STATA 12.0 software were used to perform meta-analyses. Results:Fourteen RCTs totaling 1,837 patients were included for analysis. Compared with placebo, a significant reduction in the incidence of POST (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33-0.58, P<0.00001), hoarseness (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.31-0.58, P<0.00001), and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.03-0.14, P<0.00001) and a comparable incidence of cough (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.19-1.89, P=0.38) was described in patients receiving dexamethasone, with or without concomitant drugs. Dexamethasone \u22650.2 mg/kg had a statistically greater impact on reducing the incidence of POST than dexamethasone 0.1-0.2 mg/kg, while dexamethasone \u22640.1 mg/kg did not. Dexamethasone was as effective as other drugs such as ondansetron, magnesium sulfate, ketamine gargle, betamethasone gel, and ketorolac for reducing POST (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.46-1.07, P=0.10). Dexamethasone plus a different drug was more effective than dexamethasone alone for reducing the incidence of POST at 24 hours (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.21-0.77, P=0.006). Compared with controls, a statistically higher blood glucose level was the only adverse event during the immediate postoperative period in patients receiving dexamethasone. Conclusions:Intravenous dexamethasone \u22650.2 mg/kg within 30 minutes before or after induction of general anesthesia should be recommended as grade 1A evidence with safety and efficacy in reducing the incidence of POST, hoarseness, and PONV in patients without pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, or contraindications for corticosteroids."}

While there is no data evaluating ondansetron's efficacy for preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting, this practice remains common despite a lack of supporting evidence.This study aimed to identify if prophylactic ondansetron administered with intravenous (IV) opioids prevents opioid-induced nausea or vomiting.This prospective observational study was conducted in the ED at two academic medical institutions. Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were prescribed an IV opioid with or without IV ondansetron and absence of baseline nausea. Patients' level of nausea was evaluated at baseline, 5\u00a0min, and 30\u00a0min after an IV opioid was administered and then observed for 2\u00a0hours.One hundred thirty-three patients were enrolled, with 90% of patients presenting with a chief complaint of pain. Sixty-four (48.1%) patients received an IV opioid alone and 69 (51.9%) patients received both IV ondansetron and an IV opioid. Twenty-three (17.3%) patients developed nausea caused by opioid administration. One (0.75%) patient had an emetic event and 3 (2.3%) patients required rescue antiemetics during their observation period.

This was accompanied by a significant increase in action potential duration at 90% of repolarization. Administration of both agents also increased dispersion of repolarization (ondansetron: 1\u00a0\u00b5M:+12\u00a0ms, 5\u00a0\u00b5M:+17\u00a0ms; 10\u00a0\u00b5M:+18\u00a0ms, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; domperidone: 0.5\u00a0\u00b5M:+19\u00a0ms, 1\u00a0\u00b5M:+27\u00a0ms; 2\u00a0\u00b5M:+23\u00a0ms p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Lowering of potassium concentration in bradycardic AV-blocked hearts provoked early afterdepolarizations (EADs) in 9 of 10 ondansetron-treated hearts and induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) resembling torsade de pointes in 7 of 10 ondansetron-treated hearts (86 episodes). Under the influence of domperidone, EAD and polymorphic VT occurred in 7 of 8 hearts (131 episodes). In the present study, both ondansetron and domperidone demonstrated a severe proarrhythmic potential. A significant prolongation of cardiac repolarization as well as a marked increase in spatial dispersion of repolarization represents the underlying electrophysiologic mechanisms. These results imply that application of ondansetron should be handled carefully. For regular administration, ECG monitoring should be mandatory."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Postoperative nausea and vomiting is a distressing complication of surgery, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are often prescribed to prevent it. Ondansetron is the agent typically administered to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although ramosetron has a longer duration of action than ondansetron, it remains unclear whether ramosetron is the more effective medication. We performed an updated meta-analysis on the comparative efficacy of ramosetron and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. METHODS:We searched six databases for all trials that randomly assigned patients to ramosetron or ondansetron groups. The primary outcome was postoperative nausea or vomiting in the early, late, and next-day periods. The secondary outcomes were side effects of the medications. We used the random-effects model to combine the results. Trial sequential analyses were performed to correct for repetitive testing in the updated meta-analysis. RESULTS:Twenty-seven randomized controlled trials with 3,811 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The combined results of ramosetron vs. ondansetron efficacy in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting were as follows: Risk ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.82 [0.69-0.98] for early postoperative nausea, 0.76 [0.65-0.89] for late postoperative nausea, 0.69 [0.57-0.84] for next-day postoperative nausea, 0.78 [0.63-0.98] for early postoperative vomiting, 0.57 [0.45-0.72] for late postoperative vomiting, and 0.61 [0.43-0.86] for next-day postoperative vomiting. Dizziness was significantly lower in ramosetron groups than in ondansetron groups (risk ratio [95% confidence interval] = 0.81 [0.66-0.98]). Trial sequential analysis revealed that the results for late postoperative nausea, late postoperative vomiting, and next-day postoperative nausea were conclusive. CONCLUSIONS:Ramosetron is more effective in preventing late postoperative nausea, late postoperative vomiting, and next-day postoperative nausea than ondansetron. The incidence of dizziness may be lower in patients receiving ramosetron than in patients receiving ondansetron.

PATIENTS AND METHODS:A parent controlled analgesia system was implanted with a continuous perfusion of tramadol, ondansetron and metamizole adjusted by weight. Parents are allowed to administer additional boluses if they observe irritability. We compared the variables of the cleft patients operated before and after the implantation of the system in our center. RESULTS:During 2016, 16 craniofacial clefts were operated (4 cheilorhinoplasties and 12 palatal clefts). No PCA (parent controlled analgesia) system was used. The average time of stay in PICU was 1.5 days. It took an average of 2.5 days to initiate tolerance. The mean of VAS (Visual Analogic Scale) was 3. 53% required major opioids (morphine, fentanyl) not being sufficient analgesia every 3 hours. During 2017, 7 palatal fissures and 4 cheilorhinoplasties were operated (11). Both of them were controlled by PCA. Patients with palatal cleft were admitted to the PICU with a total mean of 0.5 days. The beginning of tolerance was advanced to the first postoperative day. The VAS diminished to 0.5. Only one patient required opioids. 72% did not need to associate any type of analgesia. CONCLUSIONS:The PCA system is a safe and risk-free insurance for analgesia of fissured patients with benefits such as: decrease in pain, stay in PICU, the need for analgesia and initiation of early tolerance."}

Rats were subjected to FS in a pool (30\u00a0\u00b0C) for 15\u00a0min daily for 8\u00a0days. Control rats were kept at room temperature. METH was administered (9\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) in both control and FS rats and allowed to survive 4\u00a0h after the drug injection. METH in FS rats exacerbated BBB breakdown to Evans blue albumin (EBA) by 150 to 220% and [131]-Iodine by 250 to 380% as compared to naive rats after METH. The METH-induced BBB leakage was most pronounced in the cerebral cortex followed by the hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, and hypothalamus in both FS and naive rats. The regional BBB changes were associated with a reduction in the local cerebral blood flow (CBF). Brain edema was also higher by 2 to 4% in FS rats after METH than in naive animals. Neuronal and glial cell injuries were aggravated by threefold to fivefold after METH in FS than the control group. Pretreatment with ondansetron (1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) 30\u00a0min before METH injection in naive rats reduced the brain pathology and improved the CBF. However, TiO2-nanowired delivery of ondansetron (1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) was needed to reduce METH-induced brain damage, BBB leakage, reduction in CBF, and edema formation in FS. Taken together, these observations are the first to show that METH exacerbates BBB breakdown leading to neurotoxicity in FS animals. This effect of METH-induced BBB breakdown and brain pathology in naive and FS rats is attenuated by ondansetron treatment indicating an involvement of 5-HT3 receptors, not reported earlier."}

In subjects receiving dexamethasone, CR was twice as high for the aprepitant versus control regimen in the 6 months to\u00a0<2 year group (50%\u00a0vs. 25%) and significantly higher in the 12-17 year group (40%\u00a0vs. 7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CR was also significantly higher with aprepitant in the 6 months to\u00a0<2 year and 12-17 year age groups who received VHEC. Similar proportions of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event were seen in both regimens across age categories.A 3 day aprepitant regimen seemed effective and safe for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in paediatric subjects across subgroups (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01362530)."}

Palonosetron is a new generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists effective against acute and delayed nausea and vomiting. This study aimed to compare the therapeutic values of palonosetron and ondansetron in preventing pediatric CINV.A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel controlled study was conducted in 0-18 years old cancer patients administered highly emetogenic chemotherapy, with different dosage of palonosetron or ondansetron, both followed by dexamethasone. The patients were observed for vomiting and nausea from 0 to 120\u00a0hr after chemotherapy initiation. All adverse events (AEs) during the study period were recorded. This study was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR-TRC-14004891.Between August 2014 and July 2016, 565 patients were randomly assigned to receive 5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg palonosetron (n\u00a0=\u00a0185), 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg palonosetron (n\u00a0=\u00a0186), and 3 \u00d7 150\u00a0\u03bcg/kg ondansetron (n\u00a0=\u00a0194), of whom 181, 185, and 189, respectively, were included in the efficacy analysis.

We examined the association between peri-traumatic nausea and PTSD symptom development in three independent cohorts. Participants were recruited from (1) the Emergency Departments (ED) at Grady Memorial Hospital (GMH) in Atlanta, GA, (2) from multiple other ED sites in the TRYUMPH Research Network, and (3) from the ED during evaluation for suspected acute coronary syndrome in the REACH cohort. Administration of IV ondansetron, the most predominant antiemetic used at GMH, was used as a surrogate marker for nausea in the initial GMH cohort; nausea was then directly assessed in the internal validation at GMH, and within the replication TRYUMPH Research Network and REACH cohorts. In the GMH cohort (N\u2009=\u2009363), ondansetron administration was associated with increased 1- and 3-month posttrauma PTSD symptoms in adjusted models (all p's\u2009<\u20090.05). In the GMH internal validation, nausea significantly predicted 1 month (p\u2009=\u20090.009; n\u2009=\u200968) and 3 month (p\u2009=\u20090.029; n\u2009=\u200954) PTSD symptoms. In the TRYUMPH cohort (N\u2009=\u20091846), patient reported nausea in the ED was significantly associated with increased PTSD symptoms (p\u2009=\u20090.009) in adjusted models. In the REACH cohort (N\u2009=\u2009758), peri-traumatic nausea was associated with PTSD symptom severity at the 1-month follow-up in adjusted models (p's\u2009\u2264\u20090.008).

In humans there are five different subunits (A, B, C, D and E) of 5-HT3 receptors which can form homomeric or heteromeric receptors that may account for discrepancies in patient responses to treatments. The present study commences characterisation of the profiles of human 5-HT3 receptors containing C and/or E subunits. Recombinant 5-HT3 receptors were expressed transiently in HEK293T cells and expression was checked via immunocytochemistry staining against each epitope-tagged subunits. Functional characterisation of different combinations of 5-HT3 receptor complexes was studied via patch clamp whole cell recordings. In this study, increased current was seen in cells containing A and C subunits but only subtle changes were seen in the electrical properties of cells expressing A, AE, or ACE subunits in response to the ligand, 5-HT. Both di- and tri-heteromeric 5-HT3 receptors were significantly inhibited by the antagonists, ondansetron and palonosetron. Notably, palonosetron exerted stronger and more rapid inhibition on the 5-HT3 receptor ACE tri-heteromer compared to homomeric and di-heteromeric counterparts. This study demonstrated that the C and E subunits when assembled as simple or complex heteromeric 5-HT3 receptors may alter efficacies of 5-HT and clinically used antagonists such as ondansetron and palonosetron, and this in turn may have implications for patient responses to therapies."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:US health care disparities persist despite repeated countermeasures. Research identified race, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status as factors, mediated through individual provider and/or systemic biases; little research exists in anesthesiology. We investigated antiemetic prophylaxis as a surrogate marker for anesthesia quality by individual providers because antiemetics are universally available, indicated contingent on patient characteristics (gender, age, etc), but independent of comorbidities and not yet impacted by regulatory or financial constraints. We hypothesized that socioeconomic indicators (measured as insurance status or median income in the patients' home zip code area) are associated with the utilization of antiemetic prophylaxis (as a marker of anesthesia quality). METHODS:We tested our hypothesis in several subsets of electronic anesthesia records from the National Anesthesia Clinical Outcomes Registry (NACOR), fitting frequentist and novel Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models. RESULTS:NACOR contained 12 million cases in 2013. Six institutions reported on antiemetic prophylaxis for 441,645 anesthesia cases. Only 173,133 cases included details on insurance information. Even fewer (n = 92,683) contained complete data on procedure codes and provider identifiers. Bivariate analysis, multivariable logistic regression, and our Bayesian hierarchical model all showed a large and statistically significant association between socioeconomic markers and antiemetic prophylaxis (ondansetron and dexamethasone). For Medicaid versus commercially insured patients, the odds ratio of receiving the antiemetic ondansetron is 0.85 in our Bayesian hierarchical mixed regression model, with a 95% Bayesian credible interval of 0.81-0.89 with similar inferences in classical (frequentist) regression models. CONCLUSIONS:Our analyses of NACOR anesthesia records raise concerns that patients with lower socioeconomic status may receive inferior anesthesia care provided by individual anesthesiologists, as indicated by less antiemetics administered. Effects persisted after we controlled for important patient characteristics and for procedure and provider influences. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Our results challenge the notion that anesthesia providers do not contribute to health care disparities."}

The main hypothesis is that ondansetron improves the hemodynamic response, especially combined with phenylephrine infusion.This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study included 265 healthy pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under SA. Women were randomly allocated into four groups to receive either placebo (control), ondansetron (O) 8 mg intravenously before induction of SA, phenylephrine infusion (50 mcg/min) (P) or ondansetron plus phenylephrine (OP). Demographic, obstetric, intraoperative timing, and anesthetic variables were assessed at 16 time points. Anesthetic variables assessed included blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, nausea, vomiting, electrocardiographic changes, skin flushing, discomfort or pruritus, and vasopressor requirements.There were differences (P = 0.0001) in the number of patients with hypotension (50.8% control, 44.6% O, 20.9% P, 25.0% OP), the percentage of time points (P = 0.0001) with systolic hypotension per patient (17.4% control, 8.7% O, 2.1% P, 6.7% OP) and the number of patients requiring supplementary boluses of ephedrine (P = 0.003), phenylephrine (P = 0.017) or atropine (P = 0.0001).A 50 \u03bcg/min phenylephrine infusion reduces by 50%, the incidence of maternal hypotension compared with placebo, but infusions of phenylephrine are still not routine in our environment.

We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of ondansetron, ketamine and tramadol for prevention of shivering. METHODS:In this randomized controlled study, 120 patients aged 18-65 years of American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II undergoing various surgical procedures were included and allocated alternately to one of the 4 groups; Normal saline (Group1), Ondansetron 4mg (Group2), Ketamine 0.25mg/kg (Group3) and Tramadol 0.5mg/kg (Group4). Incidence of shivering, effect on hemodynamics, nausea, vomiting, sedation and emergence reactions were recorded. Data was analyzed using SPSS (The Statistical Package for Social Sciences) version 20.0 software. RESULTS:The patients were comparable in terms of demographic variables, baseline temperature, type of surgery, median level of sensory blockade, duration of surgery and anesthesia. Shivering was present in 17 (56.7%), 5 (16.7%), 3 (10%) and 3 (10%) patients respectively in Group 1, 2, 3 and 4 which was statistically significant when compared to Group 1 (P=0.00) The odds of NS and ondansetron, NS and ketamine, NS and tramadol was 6.53, 11.76 and 11.76 respectively which showed that study drugs were effective in preventing shivering. None of the patients were sedated in Group 1 and 2. Mild to moderate sedation was present in Group 3 and 4 (P=0.00). None of the patients had drug related adverse reactions.

METHODS:A total of 48 chronic back pain patients (N\u202f=\u202f48) participated in this double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Patients were titrated onto sustained-release oral morphine and randomized to take 8\u202fmg ondansetron or placebo three times daily concurrently with morphine during the 30-day titration. Following titration, patients underwent Naloxone induced opioid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms were then assessed by a blinded research assistant (objective opioid withdrawal score: OOWS) and by the research participant (subjective opioid withdrawal score: SOWS). RESULTS:We observed clinically significant signs of naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal in all participants (\u0394OOWS\u202f=\u202f4.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001; \u0394SOWS\u202f=\u202f14.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.7, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), however no significant differences in withdrawal scores were detected between treatment groups.

The aim of the present study was to assess the therapeutic action of ondansetron in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis model. Male-BALB/c mice were used in the present study. Acute pancreatitis was induced by an hourly injection of cerulein. Ondansetron was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 3\u00a0mg/kg. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of 5-HT3 R in pancreatic tissue was assessed with RT-PCR. Plasma amylase, lipase, and interleukin (IL)-6 levels were evaluated. Pancreatic injury was histopathologically graded, and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive cells were counted. 5-HT3R mRNA was expressed in the pancreas. In acute pancreatitis model mice, amylase, lipase, and IL-6 levels were significantly increased in the blood. With ondansetron treatment, these levels were significantly decreased. Histopathological evaluation revealed that ondansetron attenuated the inflammatory damage in acute pancreatitis. The number of infiltrated neutrophils stained by MPO was decreased by ondansetron treatment. In summary, the 5-HT3R antagonist ondansetron attenuated pancreatic injury through its anti-inflammatory action. These findings suggest that ondansetron may potentially be of use for therapy of acute pancreatitis."}

Although there are many analgesics available, there is some concern regarding their efficacy, safety and side effects. Organic selenium compounds are attractive targets of various research groups due to their pharmacological properties. OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity of 1,2-bis-(4-methoxyphenylselanyl) styrene (BMOSE) in mice, as well as to investigate the mechanism involved in the antinociceptive effect. METHODS:The animals were submitted to the formalin and glutamate tests. The assessment of the possible involvement of the serotonergic system in BMOSE antinociceptive activity was performed using the glutamate test. Also, we investigated the possible toxicity of the compound. KEY FINDINGS:1,2-bis-(4-methoxyphenylselanyl) styrene (0.1-50\u00a0mg/kg, i.g.) was efficient in avoiding nociception induced by glutamate and formalin and also reduced paw oedema. The possible involvement of 5-HT3 serotoninergic receptor antagonist ondansetron blocked the antinociceptive effect of BMOSE. The acute toxicity assays did not show any toxicity related to the administration of BMOSE (200\u00a0mg/kg).

In a before-and-after study, we tested the effectiveness of a simplified algorithm for PONV prophylaxis on the incidence of PONV. METHODS:In the first audit, we examined the adherence to our institutional guidelines for PONV prevention. In response to the results of this audit, we introduced a simplified algorithm for PONV prevention [female patients receiving triple prophylaxis (dexamethasone and ondansetron plus either a target-controlled infusion with propofol or droperidol) and male patients receiving double prophylaxis, dexamethasone, and ondansetron]. The impact of the simplification of the PONV algorithm was evaluated in a second audit. In both audits, we reviewed the medical records of all adult patients undergoing elective non-cardiac non-day-case surgery under general anaesthesia and being admitted to our post-anaesthesia care unit during two arbitrarily chosen weeks. We assessed the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and PONV after 1 and 24\u00a0h, and the compliance with the departmental algorithm for PONV prophylaxis. RESULTS:After simplification of the PONV algorithm, the overall incidence of PONV within 24\u00a0h after surgery was significantly lower than before the implementation of the simplified PONV algorithm (22% vs 33%, P=0.02). The PONV incidence within 1\u00a0h was comparable between the audits (11% vs 14%, P=0.45). The adherence to departmental guidelines for PONV prophylaxis was significantly higher after the implementation of the simplified PONV algorithm (46% vs 18%, P=0.0001).

Orally administered C18 5-HT (0.1, 1 and 10\u2009mg/kg) produced significant dose-dependent antinociceptive effects in formalin-, capsaicin- and glutamate-induced licking models. This compound also induced a significant increase in the response to thermal stimuli in the hot plate test, and its antinociceptive effect was not related to muscle relaxant or sedative actions. In a thermal hyperalgesia model, C18 5-HT presented an anti-hyperalgesic profile as evidenced by the increase in the response time of the animals. Furthermore, intraperitoneal (i.p) pretreatment with naloxone (a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, 1\u2009mg/kg), ondansetron (serotoninergic receptor antagonist (5-HT3 subtype), 0.5\u2009mg/kg) or AM241 (CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, 1\u2009mg/kg) reversed the antinociceptive effects of C18 5-HT in the hot plate model. In the formalin-induced licking model, pretreatment with naloxone reversed the antinociceptive effects of C18 5-HT, as demonstrated by an increase in the paw licking response when compared with the C18 5-HT-treated group. These findings suggest that C18 5-HT has peripheral and central antinociceptive effects and that its mechanism of action involves, ate least in part, opioid, serotoninergic and cannabinoid pathways."}

Somnolence was the most common side effect.A single dose of ondansetron is superior to bromopride and metoclopramide in preventing vomiting six hours and 24h following treatment. Oral fluid intake after receiving medication was statistically better with Ondansetronwhile also having less side effects compared to the other two agents."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "In this review, the author focused on anticraving therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD) defined by DMS-5. A comprehensive review was carried out on the available published papers on anticraving drugs for treating AUD patients.The author described all drugs with anticraving benefits for treating AUD patients approved by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency of the European Union. Then, the commonly prescribed anticraving drugs and those under development were also described.The US FDA-approved anticraving drugs included acamprosate and naltrexone, and those approved by European Medicines Agency were gamma-hydroxybutyrate and nalmefene. The author also highlighted topiramate, gabapentin, ondansetron, LY196044, ifenprodil, varenicline, ABT-436, mifepristone, citicoline, and baclofen. The putative mechanisms of action of and the use in clinical practice of those anticraving drugs were also described.Although slowly developing, the field of anticraving drugs is getting into shape as a promising entity of a pharmaceutical class of drugs. Then, the author addressed on the underused issues of those recommended, and suggested anticraving drugs by the practice guideline of the American Psychiatric Association. The author urges that clinicians should be more \"adventurous\" in prescribing those promising drugs because benefits of those anticraving drugs are far-outweighing the possible side effects of anticraving drugs, or the harms of untreated AUD itself."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after fast-track cardiac anesthesia (FTCA) in the first 24-48 hours in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) after open-heart surgery, risk factors for PONV and its influence on CICU length of stay. METHODS:A prospective observational study from January 1, 2013 to the end of December 2015 was performed in the CICU of a university hospital in the north of Jordan and Queen Alia Heart Institute, Amman, Jordan. Three hundred consecutive patients undergoing fast-track cardiac anesthesia in elective cardiac surgery were enrolled in the study. Nausea and vomiting were assessed after tracheal extubation, which was performed within 6-10 hours after surgery and during the first 24-48 hours in the CICU. Metoclopramide 10 mg intravenously was used as the initial antiemetic drug, but ondansetron 4 mg intravenously was also used as second line of management. RESULTS:Nausea was reported in 46 (15.3%) patients, and vomiting in 31 (10.3%). Among females, 38 (33.9%) patients developed nausea and 20 (17.9%) developed vomiting. Among males, 8 (4.3%) patients developed nausea and 11 (5.9%) developed vomiting. CONCLUSION:PONV are relatively low after FTCA and the prophylactic administration of antiemetic drug before anesthesia or after extubation is not necessary."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:A case of life-threatening cardiovascular collapse after inadvertent subcutaneous injection of undiluted treprostinil is reported. SUMMARY:A 29-year-old, 76-kg woman with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension managed with subcutaneous treprostinil infusion arrived at the emergency department (ED) with headache, nausea, vomiting, and a syncopal episode. Her vital signs were stable on presentation. Admission orders were placed, and the appropriate 3-mL syringe containing 7.5 mg of treprostinil intended for use with the patient's home microinfusion pump was sent from inpatient pharmacy to the ED. The order in the electronic medical record stated to administer treprostinil as a subcutaneous injection rather than an infusion. The patient's nurse transferred the 7.5 mg (3 mL) of undiluted treprostinil to a standard syringe and administered it as a single subcutaneous injection. Within minutes the patient experienced cardiovascular collapse, with a blood pressure nadir of 50/20 mm Hg. Aggressive resuscitation measures were immediately implemented. Initial management included fluids, bolus-dose vasopressors, multiple high-dose vasopressor infusions, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and loperamide. Hemodynamic stability was achieved, and vasopressors were discontinued 16 hours after the overdose event. Subcutaneous treprostinil was restarted at a reduced dose 12 hours after the overdose event and was adjusted to the patient's home dose 24 hours after the initial event. She was discharged in stable condition 30 hours after the overdose event. CONCLUSION:A patient who received an inadvertent overdose of subcutaneous treprostinil experienced cardiovascular collapse requiring aggressive resuscitation measures. Successful management of the patient was largely supportive, including fluids, bolus-dose vasopressors, multiple high-dose vasopressor infusions, ondansetron, acetaminophen, and loperamide."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "In previous studies, there seems to be a relationship between different genetic polymorphisms and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). We perform a systematic review of the current literature about the relationship between genetic polymorphisms and the presence of PONV.Two bibliographic searches were carried out in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) of studies, preferably prospective, about PONV following abdominal surgery. It was completed with a backward citation searching. A total of 73 articles were found of which 6 were selected after their critical lecture using CASPe network criteria. Relative frequency and relative risk were taken in each study according to the polymorphism.Studies about 5-HT3B gene receptor polymorphisms, ABCB1 transporter, and dopamine D2 receptor showed a significant association with the presence of PONV (p\u2009=\u20090.02, 0.01, and 0.034 respectively). In relation to cytochrome P-450 2D6 (CYP2D6) polymorphisms, two of the three analysed articles showed a significant association with postoperative vomiting (p\u2009=\u20090.007).Genetic polymorphisms could play an important role in PONV. The AAG deletion in both alleles of the 5-HT3B receptor gene, the Taq IA polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor, and the presence of three or more functional alleles of CYP2D6 seem to be related with a higher incidence of PONV, especially in the first 24\u00a0h after surgery. The 2677TT and 3435TT genotypes of the ABCB1 transporter could reduce the PONV due to their association with a greater effectiveness of ondansetron. However, new quality studies are needed to consider this relationship."}

Evidence supports oral rehydration therapy as a first-line treatment of mild to moderate dehydration. Ondansetron has proven to be a safe and effective adjunct in children with vomiting. We implemented a clinical pathway in our pediatric emergency department (ED) in January 2005 to improve care for this common condition. Our objective in this study was to determine the long-term impact of the pathway for acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on the proportion of patients receiving intravenous (IV) fluids and ED length of stay (LOS) for discharged patients.Cases were identified by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. We used statistical process control to analyze process and outcome measures for 2 years before and 10 years after pathway implementation.We included 30\u2009519 patients. We found special cause variation with a downward shift in patients receiving IV fluids after initiation of the pathway and later with addition of ondansetron to the pathway from 48% to 26%. Mean ED LOS for discharged patients with AGE decreased from 247 to 172 minutes. These improvements were sustained over time.Implementation of a clinical pathway emphasizing oral rehydration therapy and ondansetron for children with AGE led to decreased IV fluid use and LOS in a pediatric ED. Improvements were sustained over a 10-year period. Our results suggest that quality-improvement interventions for AGE can have long-term impacts on care delivery."}

Pain scores while sitting were also significantly greater in ondansetron group at arrival in PACU by 0.6 (99.7% CI: 0.1, 1.0) cm. Thereafter, pain scores did not differ significantly. Median total opioid (tramadol) consumption was 441 [Q1, Q3: 280, 578] mg in the ondansetron group and 412 [309, 574] mg in the placebo group, P=0.95.Ondansetron significantly decreased the analgesic effect of acetaminophen during the initial postoperative period. Our results thus confirm that acetaminophen analgesia is partially mediated by serotonin receptors. However, the reduction was of marginal clinical importance and short-lived."}

METHODS:Subjects aged birth to 17\u202fyears scheduled to undergo surgery and receive general anesthesia with \u22651 risk factor for PONV were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 aprepitant dose regimens (a single oral dose of aprepitant equivalent to adult doses of 10\u202fmg, 40\u202fmg, or 125\u202fmg), or a control regimen of ondansetron before anesthesia. Assessments included PK, safety, and exploratory efficacy (complete response [CR; no emesis, retching, or dry heaves and no rescue therapy within 0-24\u202fh following surgery] and no vomiting [NV; no emesis, retching, or dry heaves within 0-24\u202fh following surgery]). RESULTS:Of 220 randomized and treated subjects, 119 receiving a single aprepitant dose were sampled for PK analysis and had evaluable aprepitant plasma concentrations. A dose-dependent relationship in exposure (AUC0-8\u202fh and Cmax) was observed. Aprepitant was generally well tolerated, and the CR and NV rates were high (>80%) across treatment groups.

We examined the PONV rate in bariatric surgical patients who received triple antiemetic prophylaxis (dexamethasone, droperidol, and ondansetron) with and without antiemetic aprepitant. METHODS:Medical records of female patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery from January 1, 2014, to July 28, 2016, were reviewed for PONV episodes during 48 postoperative hours. RESULTS:In total, 338 patients received triple antiemetic, of whom 172 (51%) also received aprepitant. Rates of PONV in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) among patients with and without aprepitant therapy were 11 vs 17% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.09). Within 1\u00a0h after PACU discharge, fewer patients in the aprepitant group had PONV (19 vs 31%; odds ratio [OR] [95% CI], 0.5 [0.30-0.80]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). During the first 48 postoperative hours, PONV rates were similar between the groups (68 and 66%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.73), but fewer emesis episodes occurred in the aprepitant group (6 vs 13%; OR [95% CI], 0.45 [0.21-0.95]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Analyses were also performed with a subset of patients matched on propensity for receiving aprepitant. In this subset, OR estimates quantifying aprepitant effect on PONV were similar to those obtained from multivariable regression analyses. CONCLUSION:Addition of aprepitant to a multimodal antiemetic prophylactic regimen may be associated with significant reduction of PONV during early recovery and potentially with reduced incidence of vomiting during the first 48 postoperative hours. The high PONV rate in the first 48 postoperative hours is suggestive that introduction of scheduled anti-PONV prophylactic treatment may be desirable."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Arterial blood pressure (BP) is regulated by a complex network of peripheral and central (brain) mechanisms. Research suggests that gut bacteria-derived compounds may affect the circulatory system. We evaluated hemodynamic effects of indole, a gut bacteria-derived product of tryptophan, and indoxyl sulfate (indoxyl), a liver metabolite of indole. BP and heart rate (HR) were recorded in anesthetized, male, Wistar rats at baseline and after the administration of either a vehicle, indole, or indoxyl into the femoral vein (IV) or into the lateral ventricle of the brain (ICV). Besides, we evaluated the effect of pretreatment with flupentixol, a non-selective D1, D2, \u03b11 and 5 HT2A receptor blocker; pizotifen, a non-selective 5-HT1, 5-HT2A and 5HT2C receptor blocker; and ondansetron, a 5-HT3 blocker, on hemodynamic responses to indole and indoxyl. Vehicle infused IV and ICV did not affect hemodynamics. Indole administered IV produced a dose-dependent increase in BP but not HR. In contrast, the ICV infusion of indole produced a decrease in BP and HR. Indoxyl infused IV produced an increase in BP and HR, whereas indoxyl infused ICV did not affect BP and HR. The hemodynamic effects of indole and indoxyl were inhibited by pretreatment with ondansetron and pizotifen but not flupentixol. In conclusion, indole and indoxyl sulfate affect arterial blood pressure via peripheral and central mechanisms dependent on serotonin signalling. We propose that indole and indoxyl sulfate may be mediators in the interaction between gut bacteria and the circulatory system."}

Antidepressant-like effects of the compounds were evaluated by tail suspension test (TST) and modified forced swimming tests (MFST). Moreover, locomotor activities of the animals were assessed by an activity cage apparatus. In the series, compounds 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f (at 50 mg/kg) significantly decreased the immobility time of mice in both of the TST and MFST. The same compounds prolonged the swimming time of animals in MFST without any change in the climbing duration. These data indicated that compounds 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f possess significant antidepressant-like activities. Moreover, pre-treatments with p-chloro-phenylalanine methyl ester (an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis), NAN-190 (a 5-HT1A antagonist), ketanserin (a 5-HT2A/2C antagonist), and ondansetron (a 5-HT\u2083 antagonist) reversed the exhibited pharmacological effects.

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Thymic atypical carcinoid (TAC) is a rare thymic neuroendocrine tumor that originates in the neuroendocrine system and lacks a standardized treatment. The combination of capecitabine (CAP) and temozolomide (TEM) is associated with an extremely high and long-lasting response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, there is little evidence showing that the CAPTEM regimen is effective for TAC. For patients with unresectable or metastatic atypical carcinoid of the thymus, few treatment options are available, and the treatment efficacy is not satisfactory. To explore the efficacy and safety of the CAPTEM regimen against TAC, we conducted a retrospective review. PATIENTS AND METHODS:A total of nine patients with advanced atypical carcinoid of the thymus in the China-Japan Friendship Hospital were treated with capecitabine (750 mg/m2 twice daily, days 1-14) and temozolomide (200 mg/m2 once daily, days 10-14) every 28 days between 2014 and 2018. The disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse effects after treatment were analyzed. The DCR was calculated by RECIST version 1.1. Progression-free survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival method. RESULTS:A total of nine patients (six male and three female) were included. The median age at CAPTEM initiation was 50 years (range, 26-58). The median number of CAPTEM cycles was 8 (range, 3-23). The DCR was 89% (8/9), with eight patients achieving stable disease. Only one patient (11%) showed progressive disease. The median PFS was 8 months. Because we applied vitamin B6 and ondansetron before administering the drugs, the side effects of this regimen were very small. Adverse reactions were all below grade 3 and included myelosuppression and digestive tract reaction. CONCLUSION:Our results suggest that the CAPTEM regimen may be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of TAC. More evidence is needed to validate the effectiveness of this regimen. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Capecitabine and temozolomide regimen is effective and well tolerated in patients with advanced thymic atypical carcinoid."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Currently recommended management of acute gastroenteritis is supportive. Although the affected children habitually have vomiting, recommendations do not focus on the correction of this symptom. In this condition, elevated ketone bodies and stimuli initiated by gut mucosa damage produced by the enteral pathogen likely underlay nausea and vomiting. As compared to 0.9% saline, intravenous administration of a dextrose-containing bolus of 0.9% saline is associated with a greater reduction of circulating ketones and a shorter duration of nausea and vomiting. Nonetheless, this treatment strategy is not followed by a lower rate of hospitalization.Well-designed investigations suggest that antagonists of the type 3 serotonin receptor, most frequently oral ondansetron, reduce the rate of vomiting, improve the tolerance of oral rehydration, and reduce the need for intravenous rehydration. What is Known: \u2022 Although children with gastroenteritis habitually have vomiting, current recommendations do not focus on the correction of this symptom. What is New: \u2022 Recently acquired evidence supports the prescription of ondansetron, an antagonist of the type 3 serotonin receptor, to increase the success rate of oral rehydration therapy."}

Here we studied vortioxetine's functional effects across species (canine, mouse, rat, guinea pig and human) in cellular assays with heterologous expression of 5-HT3A receptors (in Xenopus oocytes and HEK-293 cells) and in mouse neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells with endogenous expression of 5-HT3A receptors. Furthermore, we studied the effects of vortioxetine on activity of CA1 Stratum Radiatum interneurons in rat hippocampus slices using current- and voltage-clamping methods. The patched neurons were subsequently filled with biocytin for confirmation of 5-HT3 receptor mRNA expression by in situ hybridization. Whereas, both vortioxetine and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron potently antagonized 5-HT-induced currents in the cellular assays, vortioxetine had a slower off-rate than ondansetron in oocytes expressing 5-HT3A receptors. Furthermore, vortioxetine's but not ondansetron's 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic potency varied considerably across species. Vortioxetine had the highest potency at rat and the lowest potency at guinea pig 5-HT3A receptors. Finally, in 5-HT3 receptor-expressing GABAergic interneurons from the CA1 stratum radiatum, vortioxetine and ondansetron blocked depolarizations induced by superfusion of either 5-HT or the 5-HT3 receptor agonist mCPBG. Taken together, these data add to a growing literature supporting the idea that vortioxetine may inhibit GABAergic neurotransmission in some brain regions via a 5-HT3 receptor antagonism-dependent mechanism and thereby disinhibit pyramidal neurons and enhance glutamatergic signaling."}

For this reason, LGG is the 4th most common pediatric tumor treated with proton therapy, yet clinical outcome data on efficacy and toxicity are limited. DESIGN/METHODS:We reviewed the medical records of 174 children (\u226421 years old) with non-metastatic LGG enrolled on a prospective protocol and treated with proton therapy between 2007 and 2017 to assess clinical outcomes and toxicity, and analyze patient, tumor, and treatment-related variables. RESULTS:Median age was 10.2 years (range, 2-21). Fifty-eight percent of tumors were WHO grade I; 30% WHO grade II; 12% were diagnosed on imaging characteristics alone. The most common histology was pilocytic astrocytoma (47%). The most common tumor subsites were diencephalon/optic pathway (52%), caudal brainstem (17%), and cerebellum (13%). Forty-two percent received chemotherapy before radiotherapy. The median follow-up was 4.4 years. The 5-year actuarial rates of local control, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 85% (95% CI 78-90%), 84% (95% CI 77-89%), and 92% (95% CI 85-95%). On univariate analysis, brainstem/spinal cord tumor location (62% vs. 90% elsewhere) and dose <54 GyRBE (67% vs. 91% for 54 GyRBE) were associated with inferior local control (p <0.01 for both). Twenty-two patients (12.6%) experienced acute nausea or vomiting requiring ondansetron; 2 patients (1.1%) required corticosteroids. Serious toxicities (4% of patients) included brainstem necrosis requiring corticosteroids (n=2), symptomatic vasculopathy (n=2), radiation retinopathy (n=1), epilepsy (n=1), and death from radiation-induced high-grade glioma (n =1). Thirty-nine patients (22%) developed new-onset central hormone deficiency. Pseudoprogression was observed in 32.1%. CONCLUSION:Compared to modern photon series, proton therapy reduces the radiation dose to developing brain tissue, diminishing acute toxicities without compromising disease control."}

The white-lipped tree viper, Cryptelytrops (formerly Trimeresurus) albolabris, is a pit viper native to Southeast Asia. Bites are common in countries such as Myanmar, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and China. In this report, we describe an envenomation in an American viper keeper.A healthy 28-year-old right-handed man who collects venomous snakes experienced a bite to the distal left thumb from a neonatal C. albolabris while feeding it. Upon arrival to the Emergency Department 30\u00a0min after the bite, the patient complained of significant pain and swelling that had progressed across his entire hand. He also experienced nausea, lightheadedness, mild dyspnea, and a burning sensation in his lungs. After discussing the risks and benefits, we elected to treat with five vials of Thai Red Cross Green Pit Viper antivenin. The patient was also treated with intravenous fluids, parenteral opioids, and ondansetron. He received an additional five vials due to worsening hematologic laboratory values. His laboratory tests normalized and his local findings improved significantly. He was asymptomatic at discharge and at multiple follow-up visits. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Envenomation by C. albolabris is characterized by local tissue injury and hematotoxicity. Supportive care and specific antivenom therapy comprise the management of these bites. This case reminds physicians that not all bites that present to the hospital will\u00a0be from native snakes and helps direct emergency physicians to specific expertise and uncommon antivenoms."}

Although limited by small or modest sample sizes, open-label study designs, and brief follow-up periods, studies suggest that each of these strategies can help some patients who have inadequately responded to first-line treatments. The existing data and the unmet needs of OCD patients justify research attention to further test these treatments' safety and efficacy. Previously untested drugs also deserve attention, especially as recent research has suggested new possible contributors to OCD pathophysiology.

The spinal neurochemical mechanisms of this antinociception are unknown. In the present study, bladder hypersensitivity was produced by neonatal bladder inflammation in rat pups coupled with a second inflammatory insult as an adult. Visceromotor responses (VMRs; abdominal muscle contractions) to urinary bladder distension (UBD) were used as a nociceptive endpoint under urethane-isoflurane anesthesia. bPNS consisted of bilateral biphasic electrical stimulation of the mixed motor/sensory component of the pudendal nerves. Following determination of the inhibitory effect of bPNS on VMRs, pharmacological antagonists were administered via an intrathecal catheter onto the lumbosacral spinal cord and bPNS effects on VMRs redetermined. bPNS resulted in statistically significant inhibition of VMRs to UBD in hypersensitive rats that was statistically reduced by the intrathecal administration of methysergide, WAY100636, CGP35348 and strychnine but was unaffected by naloxone, bicuculline, phentolamine, ondansetron and normal saline. This study suggests that inhibitory effects of bPNS may include serotonergic, GABA-B-ergic and glycinergic mechanisms suggesting the potential for interaction of the neuromodulatory effect with concommitant drug therapies."}

The aims of this study were to determine the efficacy of three classes of antiemetic drugs in a novel low dose cisplatin model of nausea and vomiting and measure change in potential nausea biomarkers arginine vasopressin (AVP) and cortisol. A four period cross-over blinded study was conducted in eight healthy beagle dogs of both genders. Dogs were administered 18\u00a0mg/m2 cisplatin intravenously, followed 45\u00a0min later by a 15\u00a0min infusion of either placebo (saline) or antiemetic treatment with ondansetron (0.5\u00a0mg/kg; 5-HT3 antagonist), maropitant (1\u00a0mg/kg; NK1 antagonist) or metoclopramide (0.5\u00a0mg/kg; D2 antagonist). The number of vomits and nausea associated behaviours, scored on a visual analogue scale, were recorded every 15\u00a0min for 8\u00a0h following cisplatin administration. Plasma samples were collected to measure AVP, cortisol and antiemetic drug concentrations.The placebo treated group vomited an average number of 7 times (range 2-13). None of the dogs in either the ondansetron or maropitant treated groups vomited during the observation period. The onset of nausea-like behaviour in the placebo-treated group occurred at t3.5h and peaked at t4.75h with nausea behaviour score of 58.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6\u00a0mm. Ondansetron and maropitant reduced overall the area under the curve of nausea behaviour score by 90% and 25%, respectively. Metoclopramide had no effect on either vomiting or nausea. Cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting caused concomitant increases in AVP and cortisol. In the placebo-treated group, AVP and cortisol increased from t2.5h, peaked at t5h (11.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9\u00a0pmol L-1 and 334.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046.7\u00a0nmol/L, respectively) and returned to baseline by t8h. AVP and cortisol increases were completely prevented by ondansetron and only partially by maropitant, while metoclopramide had no effect.

Group V animals received 0.9% saline alone, group O animals received 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron solution, group C animals received 10 mg/kg cyclosporin A solution, and group Mix received 0.1 mg/kg ondansetron solution and 10 mg/kg cyclosporin A solution.Our results showed that the volume of brain infarction induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in group Mix was significantly smaller than that seen in group V. Forty-eight hours after ischemia, the neurological scores of rats from group Mix significantly improved when compared to group V.Overall, our study showed that a combination of cyclosporin A and ondansetron may be a practical clinical method to treat brain infarction. However, further studies are required to investigate the cerebroprotective mechanism of action, the possible side effects of co-administration of these drugs, and the ability of these ligands to cross the blood brain barrier."}

The patients were randomly allocated to two groups: Case group (n=40) and Control group (n=40). The patients in first group were injected with 4 mg ondansetron, twice daily for five days. The patients of other group were injected with distilled water as placebo. The presence of VAP was assessed in the two groups. The collected data were analysed by SPSS software through Fisher-exact test.Eleven (13.8%) patients were diagnosed with VAP. Among them, 9 (81.8%) patients were male and 2 (18.2%) patients were female. The incidence of VAP in Case group was 5 (12.5%) patients and in Control group was 6 (15%) patients (p>0.05). Results showed that VAP in Case group was less prevalent than that in the Control group, but this difference was not significant.The study did not find an association between ondansetron administration and reduction in VAP incidence; vomiting alone may not be leading to VAP, instead silent micro aspirations may be the cause of it. None of the factor such as age, sex, weight, smoking, drug addiction was found significantly related to VAP. Only variable found related was comorbidity."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common after tonsillectomy in children. There is evidence that perioperative acupuncture at the pericardium 6 (P6) point is effective for preventing PONV in adults. Our goal was to determine if intraoperative acupuncture at the P6 point, in addition to usual antiemetics, is more effective than antiemetics alone in preventing PONV in children. METHODS:In a randomized double-blind trial, 161 children age 3 through 9\u00a0years undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy were randomized to either bilateral acupuncture at P6 plus antiemetics (n\u00a0=\u00a086) or antiemetics only (n\u00a0=\u00a075). All participants received ondansetron 0.15\u00a0mg/kg and dexamethasone 0.25\u00a0mg/kg, up to 10\u00a0mg. The presence of nausea, retching, emesis and administration of additional antiemetics were recorded during phases I and II of PACU recovery. Follow-up calls occurred on postoperative day 1 (POD 1). RESULT:During phase I and II recovery, the incidence of PONV was significantly less with acupuncture than without (7.0% vs 34.7%, RR: 0.2, 95% CI: 0.09-0.46; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The difference in PONV was driven by less nausea in the acupuncture group (5.0% vs 24.0%), with no difference in vomiting between the two groups. In the first 24 hours, PONV occurred in 36.1% with acupuncture and 49.3% without; these values did not differ significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.09). CONCLUSIONS:Children receiving acupuncture plus antiemetic therapy had less risk of developing nausea during phase I and II recovery, but there was no difference in PONV on POD 1. Acupuncture may reduce nausea in the PACU, even when combined with antiemetics."}
{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) can be very debilitating for surgical patients, and effective management reduces potential morbidity, aiding in patient satisfaction, and minimizing the need for unintended hospital stays. Risk factors include female sex, nonsmoker, and having a previous history of motion sickness or PONV. Anesthetic risk factors include receiving opioids, not receiving a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA), exposure to nitrous oxide, and extended length of anesthetic. Many treatments, including serotonin antagonists, dopamine antagonists, corticosteroids, inhaled isopropyl alcohol, and anticholinergics, as well as techniques such as TIVA, have been utilized over recent decades in an attempt to reduce PONV incidence. However, it remains a problem for a significant number of surgical patients. Aprepitant is a neurokinin-1 (substance P) antagonist, which exerts its effects via a final common pathway of the emetic centers after crossing the blood brain barrier. Aprepitant is commonly used in the cancer population to help prevent cancer chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and has shown great promise in both acute and delayed phase PONV. Published data has shown improved efficacy when compared with ondansetron administered prior to surgery. The use of aprepitant in combination with other antiemetics potentially may help decrease unplanned hospital admissions and potentially, reduce costs associated with PONV."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "PURPOSE:To date, no protocol of anesthesia for pediatric ophthalmic surgery is unanimously recognized. The primary anesthetic risks are associated with strabismus surgery, including oculocardiac reflex, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative pain. METHODS:This was a prospective, monocentric, observational study conducted in a tertiary pediatric ophthalmic unit. Our anesthetic protocol for strabismus surgery included postoperative nausea and vomiting prevention using dexamethasone and ondansetron. No drug-based prevention of oculocardiac reflex or local/locoregional anesthesia was employed. RESULTS:A total of 106 pediatric ophthalmic surgeries completed between November 2015 and May 2016 were analyzed. The mean patient age was 4.4 (range: 0.2-7.3, standard deviation: 2.4)\u2009years. Ambulatory rate was 90%. Oculocardiac reflex incidence was 65% during strabismus surgery (34/52), 50% during congenital cataract surgery (4/8), 33% during intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin (1/3), and 0% during other procedures. No asystole occurred. Postoperative nausea and vomiting incidence was 9.6% after strabismus surgery (5/52) and 0% following the other procedures. One child was hospitalized for one night because of persistent postoperative nausea and vomiting. Postoperative pain generally occurred early on in the recovery room and was quickly controlled. Its incidence was higher in patients who underwent strabismus surgery (27%) than in those who underwent other procedures (9%). CONCLUSION:Morbidity associated with ophthalmic pediatric surgery is low and predominantly associated with strabismus surgery. The benefit-risk ratio and cost-effectiveness of oculocardiac reflex prevention should be questioned. Our postoperative nausea and vomiting rate is low, thanks to the use of a well-managed multimodal strategy. Early postoperative pain is usually well-treated but could probably be more effectively prevented."}

It can seriously produce an impact on patient's quality of life. Prevention of CINV is far more effective than treatment of an established CINV. If the patient receives an optimal antiemetic regimen during the initial course of chemotherapy, the likelihood of developing emesis is greatly reduced. Although, all first generation 5HT3 antagonists demonstrate reasonable efficacy in preventing acute CINV, delayed CINV still remains a problem.To compare the effectiveness and safety of palonosetron versus ondansetron as an antiemetic agent in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.A prospective observational study was conducted in 106 patients in each treatment arm. Study duration was 12 months from January 2013 to January 2014. Consecutive patients diagnosed with cancer satisfying inclusion criteria, who were about to receive moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy were enrolled into the study after getting informed written consent. Each patient received either Intravenous (IV) palonosetron 0.25 mg or ondansetron 8 mg half an hour before chemotherapy as antiemetic. Patients were followed up for a period of five days following chemotherapy. Number of episodes, severity of vomiting and nausea and antiemetic rescue given if any were recorded. The data were graded using NCI-CTCAE (VERSION 3.0). Proportion of patients with nausea and vomiting during acute (0-24 hours), delayed (24-120 hours) and overall period (0-120 hours) in both the study groups were compared. Outcome was assessed in terms of symptom control and response. Data were analysed using SPSS-16.0 statistical software (IBM). Chi-square test was used to compare the difference in clinical response.Complete response during acute phase in ondansetron group was 80.2%, while for palonosetron it was 89.6%. During delayed phase, ondansetron and palonosetron produced complete response in 70.8% and 86.8% respectively. A total of 65.1% and 82.1% of subjects experienced complete response during the overall period in the ondansetron and palonosetron groups respectively. The difference in the response to antiemetic prophylaxis was statistically significant between the two groups for delayed (p-value = 0.006) and overall phase (p-value = 0.008).Palonosetron is clinically more efficacious than ondansetron in controlling CINV especially in delayed phase and overall period of emesis."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Using the rat conditioned gaping model of nausea, the interoceptive insular cortex (IIC) has been identified as a critical site for the regulation of lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced nausea. Indirect evidence supports a model where serotonin (5-HT) acts on postsynaptic 5-HT3 receptors and its release is suppressed by elevating 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) by monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibition to suppress nausea. Here, we directly test the hypothesis that systemic LiCl elevates 5-HT in the IIC, and this is prevented by pretreatments that reduce 5-HT release. Using male Sprague Dawley rats, LiCl (but not saline), elevated 5-HT selectively in the IIC, for 20 min after LiCl administration (127.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Systemic pretreatment with the MAGL inhibitor, MJN110, prevented the LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Systemic cannabidiol (CBD), which reduces LiCl-induced nausea by acting at 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors, also prevented LiCl-induced elevation of 5-HT in the IIC. Since 5-HT3 receptor agonists delivered to the IIC produce nausea, we tested and confirmed the hypothesis that the intra-IIC administration of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, but not MJN110, would prevent LiCl-induced conditioned gaping reactions produced by intra-IIC administration of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Finally, we demonstrate that exposure to a LiCl-paired flavor (but not a saline-paired flavor) produces elevated 5-HT release in the IIC, while rats display conditioned gaping reactions. These results confirm that LiCl-induced nausea is triggered by elevated 5-HT release in the IIC and is attenuated by treatments that reduce 5-HT availability in this region."}

Although using some anesthetic materials has been considered as the mainstay of this phenomenon, the exact factors are not known. Because of several morbidities associated with postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), its prevention and treatment has been a challenge for physicians, so several drugs have been recommended for this purpose. Based on the documented antiemetic specificity of ginger, we evaluated and compared the effects of preoperative administration of ginger on PONV with ondansetron administration as the standard medication. The participants included 100 patients with cholelitiasis who were candidate for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were divided into two groups: group A comprised 50 patients who received 500\u00a0mg oral ginger 1\u00a0h before surgery, and group B included 50 patients who received 4\u00a0mg intravenous ondansetron before completion of surgery.

We then used the GeneCards database to map the pharmacogenomic biomarkers associated with the most reported FAERS drugs. Data homogenization and statistics analysis were all conducted in R for statistical programming. Results: We identified risperidone (10.64%) as the compound with the most reported ADRs from all reported cases. Males represented 90.1% of reported risperidone cases with gynecomastia being the most reported ADR. Ibuprofen OR=188 (95% CI, 105.0000 - 335.000) and quetiapine fumarate OR=116 (95% CI, 48.4000 - 278.000) were associated with the highest odds of completed suicide in teenagers. Ondansetron hydrochloride OR=7.12 (95% CI, 1.59 - 31.9) resulted in the highest odds of pneumothorax.

Conclusion: Despite any data limitations, physicians prescribing risperidone in males should be aware of the high rates of adverse drug events and an alternative psychotropic should be considered in male patients. Further, patients with a history of pneumothorax or genetically predisposed to pneumothorax should be considered for an alternative antiemetic to ondansetron hydrochloride, due to increased odds associated with the drug and adverse event."}

In the cycles with aprepitant and those without the CR were 83.3% and 0% respectively (p<0.05). Patients receiving aprepitant in the first 2 cycles recorded less nausea in subsequent cycles that were given without aprepitant. This was not statistically significant.This triple anti-emetic regimen showed efficacy in controlling the multi-day cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to compare between 3-day and 7-day aprepitant for multi-day cisplatin regimens."}

{"keyword": "ondansetron", "texts": "Extemporaneous oral preparations are routinely compounded in the pharmacy due to a lack of suitable formulations for special populations. Such small-scale pharmacy preparations also present an avenue for individualized pharmacotherapy. Orodispersible films (ODF) have increasingly been evaluated as a suitable dosage form for extemporaneous oral preparations. Nevertheless, as with all other extemporaneous preparations, safety and quality remain a concern. Although the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) recommends analytical testing of compounded preparations for quality assurance, pharmaceutical assays are typically not routinely performed for such non-sterile pharmacy preparations, due to the complexity and high cost of conventional assay methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Spectroscopic methods including Raman, infrared and near-infrared spectroscopy have been successfully applied as quality control tools in the industry. The state-of-art benchtop spectrometers used in those studies have the advantage of superior resolution and performance, but are not suitable for use in a small-scale pharmacy setting. In this study, we investigated the application of a miniaturized near infrared (NIR) spectrometer as a quality control tool for identification and quantification of drug content in extemporaneous ODFs. Miniaturized near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is suitable for small-scale pharmacy applications in view of its small size, portability, simple user interface, rapid measurement and real-time prediction results. Nevertheless, the challenge with miniaturized NIR spectroscopy is its lower resolution compared to state-of-art benchtop equipment. We have successfully developed NIR spectroscopy calibration models for identification of ODFs containing five different drugs, and quantification of drug content in ODFs containing 2-10mg ondansetron (OND). The qualitative model for drug identification produced 100% prediction accuracy. The quantitative model to predict OND drug content in ODFs was divided into two calibrations for improved accuracy: Calibration I and II covered the 2-4mg and 4-10mg ranges respectively. Validation was performed for method accuracy, linearity and precision. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of miniaturized NIR spectroscopy as a quality control tool for small-scale, pharmacy preparations. Due to its non-destructive nature, every dosage unit can be tested thus affording positive impact on patient safety."}
{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Topiramate is a newer broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED). Some studies have shown the benefits of topiramate in the treatment of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). However, there are no current systematic reviews to determine the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2015, and last updated in 2017. OBJECTIVES:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in the treatment of JME. SEARCH METHODS:For the latest update, on 10 July 2018 we searched the Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), which includes the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid 1946- ), and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also searched ongoing trials registers, reference lists and relevant conference proceedings, and contacted study authors and pharmaceutical companies. SELECTION CRITERIA:We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating topiramate versus placebo or other AED treatment for people with JME, with the outcomes of proportion of responders and proportion of participants experiencing adverse events (AEs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of identified records, selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, cross-checked the data for accuracy and assessed the methodological quality. We performed no meta-analyses due to the limited available data. MAIN RESULTS:We included three studies with a total of 83 participants. For efficacy, a greater proportion of participants in the topiramate group had a 50% or more reduction in primarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS) compared with participants in the placebo group. There were no significant differences between topiramate and valproate in participants responding with a 50% or more reduction in myoclonic seizures or in PGTCS, or becoming seizure-free. Concerning tolerability, we ranked AEs associated with topiramate as moderate to severe, while we ranked 59% of AEs linked to valproate as severe complaints. Moreover, systemic toxicity scores were higher in the valproate group than the topiramate group.Overall we judged all three studies to be at high risk of attrition bias and at unclear risk of reporting bias. We judged all three studies to be at low to unclear bias for the remaining risk of bias domains (random sequence, allocation, blinding). We judged the quality of the evidence from the studies to be very low. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We have found no new studies since the last version of this review was published in 2017. This review does not provide sufficient evidence to support topiramate for the treatment of people with JME. Based on the current limited available data, topiramate seems to be better tolerated than valproate, but has no clear benefits over valproate in terms of efficacy. Well-designed, double-blind RCTs with large samples are required to test the efficacy and tolerability of topiramate in people with JME."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES:Topiramate has been studied in the treatment of substance use disorders and is often used off-label in the treatment of other disorders with impaired impulse control. We sought to determine whether impulsiveness could predict topiramate treatment response in individuals with cocaine use disorder (CUD). METHODS:In a post-hoc analysis of a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate for CUD, we examined the relationship between response to treatment and participants' baseline score on the Barrett Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). During the original trial, topiramate was titrated up to 300\u2009mg/day over 6 weeks and maintained for 6 weeks. All participants received weekly cognitive behavioral therapy. RESULTS:Individuals with total BIS-11 scores above the median had 11.2% more cocaine-free days with topiramate versus placebo (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.047). Individuals with first-order factor scores above the median in self-control (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.020) and at or below the median in attention (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.022), and second-order factor scores at or below the median in attentional (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.024) and motor impulsiveness (Bonferroni corrected p\u2009=\u20090.046) were all associated with a greater improvement with topiramate. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION:The results indicate an association between higher within-group impulsiveness and response to topiramate for CUD. The subscore findings may suggest a complex interaction between effectiveness and known cognitive side effects. The finding that trait impulsiveness is associated with treatment response is a promising discovery that may help guide treatment for CUD. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE:This analysis suggests a possible endophenotype based on impulsiveness that can predict treatment response to topiramate. (Am J Addict 2019;XX:1-6)."}

It has emerged as an efficacious pharmacotherapeutic option for the treatment of addiction, especially alcohol use disorder (AUD). We present a broad narrative review of the putative mechanism of action and clinical utility of topiramate with regard to AUD and other substance use disorders. Collective evidence suggests topiramate is an effective treatment option in AUD, with notable efficacy in reducing harmful drinking patterns in AUD. Though not currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the indication of AUD, topiramate should be considered as a pharmacological treatment option with high utility among AUD patients. Early pharmacogenetic studies raise the intriguing possibility of identifying patients likely to respond to topiramate using genetic testing, and initial studies show that topiramate may also be useful in treating cocaine use disorder, smoking cessation and behavioral addictions. However, further research is needed in all these areas."}

Several studies indicate that topiramate induces weight loss and a moderate reduction of plasma lipids and glucose. Based on these favourable metabolic effects, aim of this study was to evaluate if topiramate could modulate atherosclerosis development and protect target organs of dysmetabolic conditions. Thirty apoE-deficient mice were divided into three groups and fed for 12 weeks a high fat diet (Control) or the same diet containing topiramate at 0.125% and 0.250%. Body weight, water and food intake were monitored throughout the study. Plasma lipids and glucose levels were measured and a glucose tolerance test was performed. Atherosclerosis development was evaluated in the whole aorta and at the aortic sinus. Histological analysis of liver, kidney and adipose tissue was performed. Topiramate did not affect weight gain and food intake. Glucose tolerance and plasma lipids were not changed and, in turn, atherosclerosis development was not different among groups. Topiramate did not modify liver and adipose tissue histology. Conversely, in the kidneys, the treatment reduced the occurrence of glomerular lipidosis by decreasing foam cells accumulation and reducing the expression of inflammatory markers. Blood urea nitrogen levels were also reduced by treatment. Our results indicate that topiramate does not affect atherosclerosis development, but preserves kidney structure and function. The study suggests that topiramate could be investigated in drug repurposing studies for the treatment of glomerular lipidosis."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Background: Plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) plays a key role in the migraine pathophysiology. This study aimed to investigate its role in predicting diagnosis and outcome of pharmacotherapy in pediatric migraine. Methods: We prospectively recruited 120 subjects, who never took migraine-preventive agents in a pediatric clinic, including 68 patients with migraine, 30 with non-migraine headache (NM), and 22 non-headache (NH) age-matched controls. Short-term therapeutic response was measured for at least 2 weeks after the start of therapy. Responders were defined with >50% headache reduction. Plasma CGRP concentrations were measured by ELISA. Results: In the migraine group, more patients required acute therapy, as compared to the NM group (62/68, 91% vs. 5/30, 15%, p = 0.001). The mean plasma CGRP level in migraineurs either during (291 \u00b1 60 pg/ml) or between (240 \u00b1 48) attacks was higher than in NM patients (51 \u00b1 5 pg/ml, p = 0.006 and 0.018, respectively) and NH controls (53 \u00b1 6 pg/ml, p = 0.016 and 0.045, respectively). Forty-seven patients (69%) needed preventive treatments and had higher plasma CGRP levels (364 \u00b1 62 pg/ml, n = 47) than those not (183 \u00b1 54 pg/ml, n = 21) (p = 0.031). Topiramate responders had higher plasma CGRP levels than non-responders (437 \u00b1 131 pg/ml, n = 14 vs. 67 \u00b1 19 pg/ml, n = 6, p = 0.021). Survival curves of plasma CGRP levels also showed those with higher CGRP levels responded better to topiramate. Differences were not found in the other preventives. Conclusion: The plasma CGRP level can differentiate migraine from non-migraine headache. It may also serve as a reference for the therapeutic strategy since it is higher in patients requiring migraine prevention and responsive to short-term topiramate treatment. These results are clinically significant, especially for the young children who cannot clearly describe their headache symptoms and may provide new insights into the clinical practice for the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric migraine."}

Nowadays, it seems that memory may have a role in the development of dependence. In this study, the impact of topiramate and ethanol on the bioelectric activity of the brain in rabbits and on spatial memory in rats was evaluated. Short summary:The aim of the study was to assess the effect of co-administration of topiramate and ethanol on bioelectric activity of the rabbits' brain and on spatial memory in rats. Topiramate decreased ethanol-induced changes in all studied brain structures and improved memory and learning processes. Methods:A pharmaco-electroencephalography study was used to examine the effect of topiramate (25 mg/kg/day) co-administered for 6 weeks with ethanol on the bioelectric activity of the rabbits' brain. The influence of the drug was also assessed in first and second weeks of the abstinence period. Spatial memory was evaluated in rats using Morris water maze task. Topiramate (60 mg/kg/day) was administered with the ethanol for 3 weeks and for 2 weeks in the abstinence. Results:After 6 weeks of topiramate and ethanol administration, the drug decreased ethanol-induced changes in the midbrain reticular formation, hippocampus and frontal cortex. In the abstinence, the drug also inhibited the features of neuronal hyperactivity, especially in the hippocampus. Moreover, topiramate co-administered with ethanol for 3 weeks decreased ethanol-induced memory disturbance in rats. This beneficial effect was also observed in the second week of abstinence. Conclusion:These findings reveal that 'antialcoholic' activity of topiramate may be associated with its advantageous effect on memory and learning processes."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Type II diabetes is a vascular risk factor for cognitive impairment and increased risk of dementia. Disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) are hallmarks of subsequent retinal edema and central nervous system dysfunction. However, the mechanisms by which diet or metabolic syndrome induces dysfunction are not understood. A proposed mechanism is an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. Inhibition of mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase (mCA) decreases ROS and oxidative stress. In this study, topiramate, a mCA inhibitor, was examined for its ability to protect the BRB and BBB in diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. METHODS:BBB and BRB permeability were assessed using 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin in CD-1 mice fed a low-fat (control) or a high-fat diet. Topiramate administration was compared to saline controls in both preventative and efficacy arms examining BRB and BBB disruption. Body weight and blood glucose were measured weekly and body composition was assessed using EchoMRI. Metabolic activity was measured using a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Brain tissues collected from the mice were assessed for changes in oxidative stress and tight junction proteins. RESULTS:High-fat feeding caused increased entry of 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin into the brains of diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. Increased permeability to 14C-sucrose was observed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus, and attenuated by topiramate treatment, while increased permeability to 99mTc-albumin occurred in the whole brain and was also attenuated by topiramate. Treatment with topiramate decreased measures of oxidative stress and increased expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-12. In the retina, we observed increased entry of 99mTc-albumin simultaneously with increased entry into the whole brain during the preventative arm. This occurred prior to increased entry to the retina for 14C-sucrose which occurred during the efficacy arm. Treatment with topiramate had no effect on the retina. CONCLUSIONS:Blood-brain barrier and blood-retinal barrier dysfunction were examined in a mouse model of diet-induced obese type II diabetes. These studies demonstrate that there are spatial and temporal differences in 14C-sucrose and 99mTc-albumin permeability in the brain and retina of diet-induced obese type II diabetic mice. Topiramate, a mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is efficacious at both preventing and treating BBB disruption in this diet-induced obese type II diabetic mouse model."}

The present study evaluated topiramate in Dual dependence on opiate and cocaine. Methods:This placebo-controlled study (Clinical Trial Registration Code: TCTR20170201001) conducted during the period 2013-2014, Cocaine-dependent individuals maintained on methadone (n=50) were randomized to receive topiramate or identical placebo capsules. Participants' dosage ranged between 25-300 mg/day (12 wk) in escalating doses. Methadone Doses started at 30 mg/day (median 100 mg/day; range 20 -140 mg/day). In addition, all subjects received brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment (BBCET). The data were analyzed by Chi-square Test, generalized estimating equations (GEE) models, linear mixed effects (LME) model and Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Primary outcome measures included twelve weekly urine drug screens (cocaine abstinence, detection of benzoylecgonine) and treatment retention. Secondary outcome measures included correlation between cocaine craving with cocaine urine samples and Side effects of depression. Results:Topiramate was not better than placebo in reducing cocaine use. The secondary outcome showed that Topiramate was better than placebo in reducing cocaine craving. The mean [99% confidence interval (CI)] scores of cocaine craving were 24.31 (18.61-30.01) in experimental group and 21.84 (16.86-26.81) in control group (all P > 0.01). Retention and correlation between cocaine craving and cocaine urine samples were not significantly different between the groups. Topiramate usage was not associated with increase in depression symptoms as a side effect (P>0.05). Conclusion:The efficacy of topiramate in cocaine treatment is limited and needs the similar controlled clinical trials and can be used as a complementary intervention."}

Patients can present with asymptomatic serum electrolyte derangements, acute change in mental status, hyperventilation, cardiac arrhythmias, or other sequelae of metabolic acidosis and associated respiratory compensation. If taken chronically, TMP can cause renal stone formation, bone mineralization defects, and several other effects secondary to changes in serum and urine pH and electrolytes.

The current systematic review and network meta-analysis analyzes and provides an update on the clinical performance of these add-ons in comparison to placebo on body weight and body mass index (BMI) reductions. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on electronic databases: PubMed (1946-), Embase (1974-), Cochrane library (1992-), and OpenGrey (2000-) until 31 July 2018. Network meta-analyses, comparing the body weight change, BMI change and withdrawn due to adverse events of different pharmacological add-ons, was performed using a multivariate meta-regression model with random-effects, adopting a frequentist approach. To rank the prognosis for all add-ons, we used surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) values. Outcomes: From 614 potential studies identified, 27 eligible studies (n = 1,349 subjects) were included. All the studies demonstrated low to moderate risk of bias. For the analysis of body weight change, all add-ons except Ranitidine showed significant weight reductions comparing to placebo. The effectiveness rank based on SUCRA results from highest to lowest was Sibutramine, Topiramate, Metformin, Reboxetine, Ranitidine, and placebo. A similar pattern was seen for BMI change. The analysis of safety outcome did not detect significantly increased withdrawn number from the add-ons. Current evidence showed relatively good tolerance and safety of using the pharmacological add-ons. Interpretation: Topiramate and Metformin are effective add-on treatments in controlling antipsychotic-induced weight gain, comparing to placebo. They are well tolerated in short-term period. Although Sibutramine has the highest rank of the effectiveness, its license has been withdrawn in many countries due to its adverse effects. Hence, Sibutramine should not be adopted to treat antipsychotic-induced weight gain."}

The target of this work was to appraise the sexual dysfunction of antiepileptic Topiramate (TPM) and cold pressed ginger oil (CPGO) as antiepileptic alternative medicine in male mice. Fifty-four adult male albino mice were divided into nine groups (n\u2009=\u20096 mice). One group given saline and used as negative control; another one was given corn oil as vehicle. Six groups administered orally with TPM or CPGO at 100, 200 and 400\u2009mg/kg. Moreover, group of animals co-administrated orally CPGO with TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) to study their interaction. Fatty acid profile and tocols composition of CPGO were determined. in vitro assays were undertaken to evaluate radical scavenging traits of CPGO utilizing sable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH\u00b7) and galvinoxyl radicals. The study investigated antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, sexual hormones levels, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa), synaptonemal complex protein (Sycp3), Wilms tumor gene (Wt1) as well as histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Strong radical scavenging potential of CPGO against stable DPPH\u00b7 and galvinoxyl radicals was recorded. The results revealed that TPM caused a dose-dependent reduction in the antioxidant activities and testosterone content, while, malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) as oxidative stress markers were elevated. Vegfa and Sycp3 mRNA expression down-regulated at all Topiramate tested doses, but Wt1 up-regulated at 400\u2009mg/kg. TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) revealed histological alterations associated with strong positive Bax immune reactive spermatogoneal and Leydig cells. Ginger oil elevated the CAT and SOD (antioxidant enzymes), serum testosterone and diminished the oxidative stress, up regulated the expression of Vegfa and Sycp3 and down-regulated the Wt1 expression. Meanwhile, CPGO revealed no histopathological alterations and no Bax immune-reactive cells. CPGO co-administration with TPM (400\u2009mg/kg) attenuated the TPM toxicity. High doses of TPM may exhibit sexual dysfunction but CPGO is safe and has androgenic property. CPGO co-administration could protect the antiepileptic patient from the TPM sexual dysfunction."}

Our objective was to determine whether working memory capacity (WMC), the amount of information that can be stored and manipulated in memory over short time intervals, is one such factor. METHODS/PROCEDURES:Twenty-nine healthy volunteers completed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study during which they received placebo (PBO), TPM, and LZP in random order. Four hours after drug administration, a blood draw was taken to establish drug concentrations, and subjects performed a verbal working memory task while the accuracy and reaction time of their responses were recorded. Working memory capacity was calculated based on accuracy rates during the PBO session, and the role of WMC in moderating the severity of drug-related cognitive impairment was assessed by examining drug-related performance changes from PBO as a function of WMC. FINDINGS/RESULTS:Both TPM and LZP had a negative impact on task performance, although only TPM-related deficits were modulated by WMC; high WMC was associated with more severe impairments and heightened sensitivity to increasing TPM concentrations. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS:We have identified a potential clinical risk factor, high WMC, which is associated with drug-related adverse cognitive events. These data provide objective evidence in support of clinical observations that high-functioning patients are more likely to experience severe cognitive impairments."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Objective:The clinical characteristics of migraine with and without allodynia were compared to evaluate the risk factors of cutaneous allodynia in migraine. The effects of prophylactic therapy on allodynia in patients with migraine were assessed based on the change in pain threshold after therapy. Patients and methods:A total of 71 patients with migraine admitted to the Department of Neurology of Shandong Provincial Hospital were recruited in this study. The included patients were aged 18-70 years and did not present positive symptoms according to the nervous system examination. The variation in cutaneous allodynia was assessed for the role of classic prophylactic therapy in migraine-related allodynia, also termed as central sensitization (CS). Patients with migraine were randomized into two groups (topiramate and flunarizine groups), and the effect of drugs was evaluated by the change in cutaneous pain threshold between the two groups. Fifty-five patients were tested for pain threshold due to instrument failure. Pressure allodynia was measured with a force gage, and pricking was measured with Electronic von Frey Anesthesiometer. The pain threshold was measured every 3 months for 6 months. The variations in pain threshold after treatment were compared using t-test and \u03c7 2 test. Results:Allodynia was seen in 70.4% of the patients; of these, 76.3% were females. Female gender, duration of illness, and frequency of migraine attacks per month were significantly associated with allodynia. The rate of allodynia and frequency of headache declined significantly, the number of patients with allodynia was reduced, and the pain threshold improved dramatically after treatment. The composite adverse events were low after treatment with topiramate and flunarizine. Conclusion:Allodynia was observed, especially in females who experienced frequent migraine attacks for a prolonged period. Gender, duration of illness, and number of migraine attacks per month were the major predictors of allodynia. Topiramate and flunarizine administered orally for a short duration can effectively improve the pain threshold and CS of patients with migraine, and efficiently relieve allodynia."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "We summarized and compared meta-analyses of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions targeting physical health outcomes among people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Major databases were searched until June 1, 2018. Of 3,709 search engine hits, 27 meta-analyses were included, representing 128 meta-analyzed trials and 47,231 study participants. While meta-analyses were generally of adequate or high quality, meta-analyzed studies were less so. The most effective weight reduction interventions were individual lifestyle counseling (standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.98) and exercise interventions (SMD=-0.96), followed by psychoeducation (SMD=-0.77), aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.73), topiramate (SMD=-0.72), d-fenfluramine (SMD=-0.54) and metformin (SMD=-0.53). Regarding waist circumference reduction, aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-1.10) and topiramate (SMD=-0.69) demonstrated the best evidence, followed by dietary interventions (SMD=-0.39). Dietary interventions were the only to significantly improve (diastolic) blood pressure (SMD=-0.39). Switching from olanzapine to quetiapine or aripiprazole (SMD=-0.71) and metformin (SMD=-0.65) demonstrated best efficacy for reducing glucose levels, followed by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (SMD=-0.39), dietary interventions (SMD=-0.37) and aripiprazole augmentation (SMD=-0.34), whereas insulin resistance improved the most with metformin (SMD=-0.75) and rosiglitazone (SMD=-0.44). Topiramate had the greatest efficacy for triglycerides (SMD=-0.68) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (SMD=-0.80), whereas metformin had the greatest beneficial effects on total cholesterol (SMD=-0.51) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (SMD=0.45). Lifestyle interventions yielded small effects for triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (SMD=-0.35 to -0.37). Only exercise interventions increased exercise capacity (SMD=1.81). Despite frequent physical comorbidities and premature mortality mainly due to these increased physical health risks, the current evidence for pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions in people with schizophrenia to prevent and treat these conditions is still limited and more larger trials are urgently needed."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) is a key neuropeptide involved in the activation of the trigeminovascular system and it is likely related to migraine chronification. Here, we investigated the role of CGRP in an animal model that mimics the chronic migraine condition via repeated and intermittent nitroglycerin (NTG) administration. We also evaluated the modulatory effect of topiramate on this experimental paradigm. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with NTG (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, every 2 days over a 9-day period (5 total injections). A group of animals was injected with topiramate (30\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) or saline every day for 9\u00a0days. Twenty-four hours after the last administration of NTG or vehicle, animals underwent tail flick test and orofacial Von Frey test. Rats were subsequently sacrificed to evaluate c-Fos and CGRP gene expression in medulla-pons region, cervical spinal cord and trigeminal ganglia. RESULTS:NTG administration induced spinal hyperalgesia and orofacial allodynia, together with a significant increase in the expression of CGRP and c-Fos genes in trigeminal ganglia and central areas. Topiramate treatment prevented NTG-induced changes by reversing NTG-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia, and inhibiting CGRP and c-Fos gene expression in all areas evaluated. CONCLUSIONS:These findings point to the role of CGRP in the processes underlying migraine chronification and suggest a possible interaction with gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate transmission to induce/maintain central sensitization and to contribute to the dysregulation of descending pain system involved in chronic migraine."}

Currently, there are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved antiepileptic drugs for neonates, and authors of the medical literature have yet to reach a consensus on the most adequate approach to neonatal seizures. Topiramate is readily used in the adult and older pediatric population for the management of migraines and partial-onset seizures. Topiramate continues to gain favor among pediatric neurologists who often recommend this medication as a third-line treatment of neonatal seizures. We report our recent experience with 4 preterm neonates, born between 2015 and 2017, who developed radiographic signs of necrotizing enterocolitis after receiving topiramate for seizures. Each was given oral topiramate for the treatment of electrographic and clinical seizures and developed the subsequent diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis, with abdominal distention, hemoccult-positive stools, and radiographic signs of intestinal distention and pneumatosis. More research regarding the risk factors of topiramate use in premature infants is needed."}

Method:This was a 5 week, between-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study with topiramate [0 mg/day (placebo), 100 mg/day, 200 mg/day] and aripiprazole [0 mg/day (placebo), 7.5 mg/day, 15 mg/day] in 90 non-treatment seeking, heavy drinking, alcohol-dependent individuals. Main outcomes were the efficacy of 200 mg/day topiramate and 15 mg/day aripiprazole, alone and combined, in reducing drinks consumed during an alcohol self-administration procedure (human laboratory phase) and while receiving the study medications prior to the laboratory session (naturalistic drinking phase). Other outcomes in the laboratory phase included alcohol craving, and alcohol biphasic effects. Results:In the human laboratory phase, topiramate 200 mg/day reduced alcohol craving [**P < 0.01] and amplified alcohol-induced stimulation [*P < 0.05], but did not reduce the number of drinks consumed. Topiramate 200 mg/day was also effective in reducing drinking days [*P < 0.05], and alcohol craving [*P < 0.05], in the naturalistic drinking phase. No significant findings were found for aripiprazole for any of the outcomes analyzed. Conclusion:Participants receiving 200 mg/day topiramate reported reduced alcohol drinking and craving, and increased alcohol-related stimulation. These findings provide further support for the role of topiramate as a pharmacological treatment for AUD. ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier:NCT00884884. Short Summary:This study tested topiramate and aripiprazole alone and in combination. The results replicate past findings and suggest that topiramate may be an effective treatment for alcohol use disorder. The present results suggest that the combination of topiramate and aripiprazole do not warrant further evaluation."}

Valproate is associated with severe idiosyncratic adverse effects, the most notable being valproate-induced hyperammonemic encephalopathy (VHE). Topiramate is also a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant that is also extensively used for migraine prophylaxis, as a mood stabilizer, and for alcohol dependency. There is increased occurrence of VHE when valproate is used with other medications like phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Our case report is on a young patient who was on valproic acid and topiramate and developed metabolic encephalopathy with hypoxic respiratory failure. We reviewed the causes and management of the hyperammonemic encephalopathy. We believe that clinicians should be aware of possible hyperammonemic encephalopathy in any patient who is taking valproic acid and presenting with impaired consciousness and cognitive decline. We also underline the importance of early recognition and high index of suspicion of encephalopathy related to hyperammonemia."}

METHODS:Data of the LTG concentration and clinical information were analyzed retrospectively from a therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) database at the Clinical Pharmacy Laboratory of Xi'an Central Hospital between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2018. The independent-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA analysis and Bonferroni and Tamhane T3 post-hoc test, the stepwise multivariate regression analysis were adopted by IBM SPSS, version 22.0. RESULTS:226 serum samples met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. The mean LTG serum concentration was 5.48\u00b13.83 \u03bcg/mL. There were no gender differences (P = 0.64), and there were no significant effects by age on LTG serum concentration after age stratification (3-14 years old, 14-45 years old, 45-59 years old) (P = 0.05). Multiple regression analysis showed that the daily LTG dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentrations. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, the mean steady-state LTG concentration could be decreased by 30.73% compared with LTG monotherapy. Among enzyme-inducer AEDs, particularly strong inducer Carbamazepine (CBZ) could decrease the mean LTG concentration by 53.65%, but weak inducer AEDs such as Oxcarbazepine (OXC) and Topiramate (TPM) had no effect, Valproic acid (VPA) could increase the mean LTG concentration by 93.95%, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination. CONCLUSIONS:There were no significant gender and age effects, but the LTG daily dose and co-administration of other AEDs significantly affected LTG serum concentration. Combination with enzyme-inducer AEDs, especially CBZ could significantly decrease LTG serum concentrations, VPA could significantly increase LTG serum concentrations, and the inducer only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of VPA in triple combination. In the clinical setting, these findings can help to estimate LTG concentrations and adjust dosage and evaluate adverse drug reactions."}

Topiramate inhibits renal carbonic anhydrase, which can lead to renal tubular acidosis and hypercalciuria. We studied 40 consecutive children who initiated topiramate therapy for seizures between January 1997 and February 2003, followed for a mean of 36 months.Serum electrolytes, urinary calcium/creatinine ratios, and renal ultrasonography were performed before topiramate and every 6 months thereafter.Four children developed nephrolithiasis and/or nephrocalcinosis, which resolved on discontinuation of topiramate. In 40 patients, the mean urinary calcium/creatinine ratio increased over time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mean serum bicarbonate in 40 patients decreased over time (P\u00a0< 0.01). Twenty-three children had urinary calcium/creatinine ratios before topiramate. Nine children with baseline hypercalciuria (defined as urinary calcium/creatinine >0.21) were compared with the 14 children with baseline normal urinary calcium excretion. A greater increase in urinary calcium/creatinine ratios occurred in hypercalciuric children (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a greater decrease in serum bicarbonate levels occurred in the hypercalciuric children (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with children with baseline normal calcium excretion.

Despite urgent need for effective interventions, the best available psychosocial treatment options yield only modest effects. Topiramate showed promise as an adjunctive pharmacotherapy to a psychosocial intervention for cannabis misuse among adolescents and young adults in a recent clinical trial, but it was not well tolerated. This study investigated associations between clinical characteristics and side effects and dropout among adolescents and young adults randomized to topiramate.This study involved secondary data analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled trial of topiramate for treating cannabis misuse (ages, 15-24 years; 50% female). We explored the interaction effects of baseline characteristics and medication condition (topiramate vs placebo) on treatment dropout. We also explored the relationship between side effects and dropout.Higher cannabis problems were significantly associated with reduced hazard of dropout in the topiramate group (P = 0.048) and were nonsignificantly associated with increased hazard of dropout in the placebo group (P = 0.062). Results also showed that memory difficulties were an overwhelming predictor of dropout in the topiramate condition; 42% of participants who dropped out experienced memory difficulties, whereas none of those who remained in the study experienced these effects.By identifying who may most benefit from and tolerate this medication, treatment for substance use disorders can become more individualized and positive outcomes may be enhanced."}

Percentage of patients achieving \u22655%, \u226510%, or \u226515% weight loss on medications was determined and percent weight change on each medication was compared to percent weight change of the rest of the cohort. Our results showed that 54.1% of study patients lost \u22655% of their postsurgical weight; 34.3% and 22.9% lost \u226510% and \u226515%, respectively. RYGB had higher median percent weight loss (-8.1%) than SG (-3.3%) (p = 0.0515). No difference was found in median percent weight loss with medications started at weight plateau (-6.0%) versus after weight regain (-5.4%) (p = 0.5304). Patients taking medications at weight loss plateau lost 41.2% of total body weight from before surgery versus 27.1% after weight regain (p = 0.076). Median percent weight change on metformin was -2.9% compared to the rest of the cohort at -7.7% (p = 0.0241). No difference from the rest of the cohort was found for phentermine (p = 0.2018) or topiramate (p = 0.3187). Topiramate, phentermine, and metformin are promising weight loss medications for 21 to 30 year olds. RYGB patients achieve more weight loss on medications but both RYGB and SG benefit. Median total body weight loss from pre-surgical weight may be higher in patients that start medication at postsurgical nadir weight.

We aimed to comprehensively compare different augmentation agents for treatment-resistant OCD in adults. METHODS:PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CENTRAL, the WHO's ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched on February 20, 2018. Pairwise meta-analysis and Bayesian network meta-analysis were performed. The primary outcome was efficacy measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. The secondary outcomes were tolerability (side-effect discontinuation) and acceptability (all cause discontinuation). Mean differences (MDs) and odds ratios (ORs) were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS:Thirty-three articles with 34 trials (1216 patients) were included. Memantine (MD, -8.94; 95% CI, -14.42 to -3.42), risperidone (-4.47, -8.75 to -0.17), topiramate (-6.05, -10.89 to -1.20), lamotrigine (-6.07, -11.61 to -0.50), and aripiprazole (-5.14, -9.95 to -0.28) were significantly superior to placebo. Antipsychotic (-4.09, -6.22 to -1.93) and glutamatergic (-5.22, -7.53 to -2.84) agents were significantly superior to placebo. Considerable heterogeneity was found across studies, and baseline symptom severity was identified as a significant moderator. After baseline severity adjustment, quetiapine (-5.00, -8.59 to -1.29) and olanzapine (-8.28, -15.34 to -1.13) became significantly superior to placebo. CONCLUSIONS:Our study supports the use of antipsychotic or glutamatergic agents as augmentation agents for treatment-resistant OCD. Topiramate, lamotrigine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, memantine, and quetiapine are alternative augmentation drugs; however, a definitive conclusion of the best drug remains undetermined because of the considerable heterogeneity and limited numbers of studies and patients for each agent."}

The present study aimed at investigating the neuroprotective potential of TPM on 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced striatal neurodegeneration and Huntington's disease-like symptoms.

TPM in addition, enhanced the phosphorylation of the protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2/cAMP response element binding protein (Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/CREB) cue. Moreover, improvement in oxidative status, suppression of caspase-3 activity and restoration of striatal BDNF were noticed following treatment with TPM.

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "PURPOSE:The literature on topiramate use in cocaine-dependent patients was reviewed. SUMMARY:Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials evaluating the use of topiramate in patients who were cocaine dependent were analyzed. The results from the studies indicated that topiramate, when used in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy, may be effective in reducing short-term cocaine use and should be considered as a possible treatment option. Other trials suggested that topiramate was not effective in patients with a dual diagnosis of opioid and cocaine dependence. Two trials suggested that short-term abstinence assisted by pharmacotherapy is a predictor of longer-term (6 months and 1 year, respectively) abstinence. Cocaine use is dependent on multiple factors; therefore, a reduction in use or craving is not definitively associated with abstinence. However, decreased use reduces potential patient harm and the amount of money spent on illicit cocaine. The findings of this literature review should be used to encourage the completion of more trials that are appropriately designed. Topiramate was shown to be effective for increasing cocaine abstinence, the proportion of cocaine nonuse days, and the proportion of patients to attain 3 consecutive weeks of cocaine abstinence and decreasing the abuse liability of cocaine. Conflicting results in clinical trials do not provide a definitive answer regarding topiramate's efficacy in managing cocaine dependence. CONCLUSION:Available research neither validates nor invalidates the hypothesis that topiramate is efficacious in attaining abstinence in cocaine-dependent patients."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "INTRODUCTION:Topiramate is a well-known anticonvulsant drug with a broad spectrum of actions. It has been proposed in the treatment of several types of epileptic seizures both in monotherapy and in add-on. Its usage has been extended to other disorders including migraine, essential tremor, obesity, alcohol and drug addiction. The most frequent side-effects of topiramate include dizziness, somnolence, insomnia, and ataxia. Paraesthesia, metabolic acidosis, kidney stones, hypohidrosis, cognitive impairment and eye symptoms have also been reported. CASE REPORT:We report on a girl affected by epileptic seizures treated with levetiracetam for five years. Due to worsening of the seizures, the dosage of this drug was increased and afterwards lowdosage topiramate was initiated. After 12 days from the introduction of topiramate, the girl began to present neurologic signs including limbs rigidity, pain, incoordination and flexed fingers. Gradual withdrawn of the topiramate resulted in progressive resolution of the symptomatology. This clinical episode could represent a probable topiramate-related side effect (Naranjo score 5), never reported before in this form."}

Materials and Methods:This randomized controlled trial, in Besat Hospital in Hamedan, Iran from 22 Nov 2013 to 22 Nov 2015 (Registered code: IRCT Number: IRCT2015010120527N1), included 54 patients, at risk of recurrent febrile seizure, inhibited from taking phenobarbital. Samples were randomly divided into two groups. The first group received diazepam treatment during fever episodes and the second group received daily dose of topiramate. A one-year follow-up of recurrent febrile seizure and its complications was also conducted. Results:Thirty-four patients (17 patients in each group) completed the one-year course of the trial. Recurrent febrile seizure was not observed in the course of preventive treatment. The prevalence of minor complications was 29.4% in the diazepam group and 48.5% in the topiramate group. No major complication was observed in among the subjects. Conclusion:Topiramate can be recommended for preventing recurrent febrile seizure when the use of frontline medicines is not possible."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Topiramate (TPM) is the main antiepileptic drug used for the control of partial and generalized seizures in both adults and children. In association with clinical observations, the analysis of plasmatic concentration of TPM is of utmost importance for the individual adjustment of the administered dose to the patient. In the present work, a bioanalytical method was developed and validated for TPM analysis in plasma samples by capillary electrophoresis with capacitively-coupled contactless conductivity detection (CE-C4 D). A simple background electrolyte composed of 15 mmol/L triethylamine, hydrodynamic injections (0.8 psi for 5 s) and a moderate separation voltage (20 kV) were used, rendering relatively short analysis times (<3 min). The sample pre-treatment was carried out by liquid-liquid extraction using methyl terc-butyl ether as solvent and 200 \u03bcL of plasma. The method was validated according to the official guidelines from the European Medicine Agency and showed linearity in plasmatic concentration range from 1 to 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, which covers the clinically-relevant interval. The lower limit of quantification of 1 \u03bcg/mL obtained also allows following patients with low dosage of the drug. The method was successfully applied to analysis of plasma samples and allowed the identification of 80% under-medicated patients in the analyzed patient pool."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "Migraine is the sixth most common cause of disability in the world. Preventive migraine treatment is used to reduce frequency, severity and duration of attacks and therefore lightens the burden on the patients' quality of life and reduces disability. Topiramate is one of the preventive migraine treatments of proven efficacy. The mechanism of action underlying the preventive effect of topiramate in migraine remains largely unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we examined the central effects of a single dose of topiramate (100mg) on trigeminal pain in humans, compared to placebo (mannitol). In this prospective, within subject, randomized, placebo-controlled and double-blind study, 23 healthy participants received a standardized nociceptive trigeminal stimulation and control stimuli whilst being in the scanner. No differences in the subjective intensity ratings of the painful stimuli were observed between topiramate and placebo sessions. In contrast, topiramate significantly decreased the activity in the thalamus and other pain processing areas. Additionally, topiramate increased functional coupling between the thalamus and several brain regions such as the bilateral precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex. These data suggest that topiramate exhibits modulating effects on nociceptive processing in thalamo-cortical networks during trigeminal pain and that the preventive effect of topiramate on frequent migraine is probably mediated by an effect on thalamo-cortical networks."}

{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:The objective of this study was to provide an evaluation of the benefits and adverse effects (AEs) of psychiatric and seizure medications commonly used for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). METHODS:As part of the National Survey on Treatment Effectiveness for Autism, we report ratings of 26 psychiatric and seizure medications by 505 participants. Each medication was rated with a standardized scale for overall benefits, overall AEs, and specific symptoms affected. The frequency of use and net perceived benefit (overall benefit minus overall AE) are reported. RESULTS:Most medications were rated as having a slightly greater benefit than AE. Six medications (lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, clonidine, guanfacine, buspirone, and sertraline) had benefit ratings that were more than twice their adverse rating. Conversely, some medications had slightly negative net benefit ratings (worse AEs than benefits on average), including Adderall, Paroxetine, Quetiapine, Olanzapine, and Topiramate. However, there were wide variations in individual ratings of benefit and AEs, suggesting that clinical response to medications was highly variable, so these scores simply represent averages. A ranking of the top medications (those with the highest net perceived benefit) for each of 18 different symptoms is provided, which may provide some clinical guidance as to which medications may be most worth considering for a given symptom. A comparison of the survey results with the results of clinical trials shows generally good agreement in terms of medication benefits with some differences; in some cases the differences are because the clinical trials did not assess all of the symptoms assessed by this survey. CONCLUSIONS:It is hoped that physicians and their patients will find the survey results useful in selecting the most promising medications for a given symptom, and also for monitoring for likely benefits and AEs, especially for medications for which few or no studies have been carried out in ASD populations."}

Neuropathic pain is common and important and has inappropriate complications, and despite their importance, there is no effective treatment for them.Because of the importance of neuropathic pain and safe and effective treatment, in this study, we determined the effect of topiramate versus gabapentin in patients with neuropathic pain.In this randomized clinical trial, 30 patients with pain attributed to neuropathy who had at least one month of neuropathic pain in one area, were randomized to receive either gabapentin, titrated from 300 mg/day to a maximum of 900 mg/day or topiramate, titrated from 50 mg/day to a maximum of 100 mg/day after a 4-week period in the neurology clinic of Imam Khomeini Hospital of Urmia city, Iran in 2015. Complication, drug tolerance rate and pain were investigated. The pain was measured on visual analog scale (VAS). The data were analyzed by SPSS version 18, and using descriptive statistics, t-test, and ANOVA.In patients treated by gabapentin, the primary pain score was 74.33\u00b110.29, this score decreased to 49.46\u00b111.41 and 29.93\u00b111.92 in the second and fourth week after intervention with gabapentin. In topiramate treated patients, the primary score was 76.00\u00b19.69. It decreased to 54.33\u00b110.31 and 34.20\u00b16.09 at the same time. There were no significant differences between both groups in terms of average reduction of pain intensity [gabapentin group (59.73%) compared with topiramate (55%) (p=0.48)]. In the present study, the only complication reported in patients treated by gabapentin was drowsiness, but other uncommon side effects were nausea and dizziness.This study showed that both gabapentin and topiramate reduce pain. Topiramate can also be a good alternative choice, if gabapentin has side effects for patients and it cannot be tolerated, topiramate can be a good replacement.The trial was registered at the Thai Registry of Clinical Trials (http://www.clinicaltrials.in.th) with the TCTR ID: TCTR20170615001.This research has been financially supported by Research Council of Urmia University of Medical Sciences."}

CASES:Two middle-aged women experienced sudden onset of acute glaucoma and acquired myopia after taking topiramate. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated bilateral ciliochoroidal effusion and angle closure. The A-scan ultrasonography revealed shallow anterior chamber and thick lens. After the treatment\u00a0and drug withdrawal, intraocular pressure, refractive status and angle anatomy returned to normal and there was resolution of ciliochoroidal effusion. During the clinical course, the anterior chamber depth (ACD) increased from 2.02 to 3.30\u00a0mm (1.28\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 1.94 to 3.36\u00a0mm (1.42\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The lens thickness (LT) became thinner from 4.53 to 4.31\u00a0mm (0.22\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 4.59 to 4.30\u00a0mm (0.29\u00a0mm of changes) OS in the first case. In the second case, the ACD increased from 2.33 to 3.07\u00a0mm (0.74\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 2.30 to 3.05\u00a0mm (0.75\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The LT became thinner from 4.42 to 4.27\u00a0mm (0.15\u00a0mm of changes) OD and from 4.38 to 4.26\u00a0mm (0.12\u00a0mm of changes) OS. The forward displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm contributed more to the shallowness of the anterior chamber than the thickening of the lens itself (only accounting for 20%). CONCLUSION:Topiramate-induced bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma and myopic shift was due to ciliochoroidal effusion which resulted in thicker lens and shallow anterior chamber. The later was mainly due to anterior displacement of the lens-iris diaphragm."}
{"keyword": "Topiramate", "texts": "BACKGROUND:Topiramate (TPM) decreases cytokine release and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cytokine and endothelin-1 (ET-1) secretion and ROS formation play an important role in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. We aimed to evaluate whether TPM prevents damage occurring in lung tissue during I/R. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A total of 27 Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups of nine. To the I/R group, two hours of ischemia via infrarenal abdominal aorta cross-ligation and then two hours of reperfusion process were applied. TPM (100 mg/kg/day) orally for seven days was administered in the TPM treatment group. After the last dose of TPM treatment, respectively, two hours of ischemia and two hours of reperfusion were applied in this group. RESULTS:Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (p < 0.05), malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05), myeloperoxidase (MPO) (p < 0.05) and ET-1 (p < 0.05) levels of TPM treatment group's lung tissue were significantly lower than for the I/R group. Caspase-3 and histopathological damage were rather lower than that of the I/R group. CONCLUSIONS:During I/R, lung damage occurs due to excessive TNF-\u03b1 and ET-1 release and ROS generation. TPM could well reduce development of lung damage by decreasing cytokine and ET-1 release and levels of ROS produced."}

In this review, we describe a case of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis. We review the frequency of metabolic acidosis among children and adults, as well as the mechanism of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and renal tubular acidosis in topiramate users. Finally, we describe the long-term effects of topiramate-induced metabolic acidosis, including nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, and bone degradation. Patients who are prescribed topiramate should be carefully monitored for metabolic derangements, and they may benefit from alkali supplementation, or in extreme cases, discontinuation of the drug altogether."}

Recent clinical data suggests that administration of topiramate to women during pregnancy increases the risk of oral clefts in their offspring. To better understand the potential effects of topiramate, we dosed adult female zebrafish with topiramate, and investigated the altered morphologies in adult females and their offspring. It showed that topiramate-treated female fish had reduced oocyte maturation, and the survival rates of their offspring were seriously decreased during embryogenesis. In addition, around 23% of offspring displayed cartilage malformation in the craniofacial area, such as loss of ceratobranchial cartilages as well as impaired ceratohyal, Meckel's cartilage and ethmoid plate development. Moreover, mineralization of ceratohyal, Meckel's cartilage, and vertebrae were downregulated during bone development. Taken together, we concluded that topiramate impaired oogenesis in the maternal reproductive system, and then caused offspring cartilage malformation or bone dysplasia."}

Current therapies are limited, leaving up to 50% of patients symptomatic despite treatment, underscoring the need for additional treatment options. Qsymia, an FDA-approved medication for obesity, combines phentermine and topiramate ER. Topiramate has demonstrated efficacy for both BED and BN, but limited tolerability. Phentermine is FDA-approved for weight loss. A rationale for combined phentermine/topiramate for BED and BN is improved tolerability and efficacy. While a prior case series exploring Qsymia for BED showed promise, randomized studies are needed to evaluate Qsymia's safety and efficacy when re-purposed in eating disorders. We present a study protocol for a Phase I/IIa single-center, prospective, double-blinded, randomized, crossover trial examining safety and preliminary efficacy of Qsymia for BED and BN. METHODS:Adults with BED (n=15) or BN (n=15) are randomized 1:1 to receive 12weeks Qsymia (phentermine/topiramate ER, 3.75mg/23mg-15mg/92mg) or placebo, followed by 2-weeks washout and 12-weeks crossover, where those on Qsymia receive placebo and vice versa. Subsequently participants receive 8weeks follow-up off study medications. The primary outcome is the number of binge days/week measured by EDE. Secondary outcomes include average number of binge episodes, percentage abstinence from binge eating, and changes in weight/vitals, eating psychopathology, and mood. DISCUSSION:To our knowledge this is the first randomized, double-blind protocol investigating the safety and efficacy of phentermine/topiramate in BED and BN. We highlight the background and rationale for this study, including the advantages of a crossover design.

The objective of present study is to determine which antipsychotic medication is highly effective in a real-world clinical setting considering adjuvant pharmacotherapy over a 10-year follow-up period.MethodsA total of 2300 patients with schizophrenia were recruited at the Seoul National University Hospital, and participants received amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, haloperidol, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, ziprasidone for up to 10-years. Time-to-discontinuation of antipsychotic medications was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Group differences were compared using log-rank tests.ResultsThe most frequently used drugs were Risperidone, Aripiprazole, Olanzapine in the antipsychotic drug, Valproate, Lamotrigine, Topiramate in the anticonvulsant agents, Escitalopram, Sertraline, Milnacipran in antidepressants, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Zolpidem in anxiolytics or sedatives, Propranolol, Benztropine, Trihexyphenidyl in antiparkinson drugs. About half of the patients discontinued taking antipsychotics before 1.5 years. Clozapine showed significantly longer time to discontinuations compared to other antipsychotic drugs. Aripiprazole also showed a lower incidence of discontinuation except for Clozapine and Olanzapine.DiscussionClozapine was found to be the most effective antipsychotics in terms of time to discontinuations.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the dose, use of other AEDs on TPM plasma concentration (Cp ), and frequency of epileptic seizures. A cross-sectional analytical study was developed with patients aged 18-60\u00a0years, for diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy, using TPM in monotherapy or associated with other AEDs. The following variables were analyzed: age, frequency of epileptic seizures, pharmacotherapeutic regimen with its respective doses, adherence to medication treatment, and adverse events score. Thirty-seven patients were included, 83.8% of the patients presented Cp below the therapeutic range. Multiple linear regression estimated that the increase of 1.0\u00a0mg/kg/d promoted an increase of 0.68\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in TPMCp , while the use of inducers predicted a reduction of 2.97\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Multiple Poisson regression predicts that an increase of 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in TPMCp decreased the patient's chance of presenting seizures, and patients using AED inducers were about ten times more likely to present seizures than those who do not use (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In addition, for patients using AED inducers with Cp below the therapeutic range, the mean number of seizures per month was greater than those with Cp within the therapeutic range. The prescribed dose and the use of AED inducers influence Cp of TPM, likewise the low Cp of first-line AEDs and of the adjuvant in the treatment, TPM, as well as low TPM dose seem to affect the control of epileptic seizures."}

One hundred males (Age range=18\u201334; SD=4.11) undergoing abstinence were assigned randomly to four groups (n=25) of Topiramate (TPM), Contingency Management (CM) and the Combined Method plus a placebo control group. Treatment was provided for twelve weeks for the experiment groups, and only the control group received the placebo. Participants in the Cash-based and CM Condition had an identical 12-week escalating schedule of reinforcement (cash-based incentives worth $0, $20, $40, and $80).

{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "Background:The denomination of typical antipsychotic for loxapine has poor relation to current knowledge of the molecule's relevant modes of action. Materials and Methods:Competition binding experiments were performed on expressed human recombinant receptors in CHO cells and HEK-293 cells for D1 to D5, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7. In vitro autoradiographies using [11C]-Raclopride [18F]-Altanserin [18F]-MPPF [11C]-SB207145, and [18F]-2FNQ1P were measured in brain tissue of a male primate followed by addition of increasing doses of loxapine succinate. Results:In cell cultures, the measured Kb confirmed high affinity of loxapine for the D2; intermediate affinity for the D1, D4, D5, 5-HT2C receptorsl and a lack of affinity toward D3, 5-HT1A, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. In brain tissue, PET autoradiographies showed a radiopharmaceutical displacement at low concentrations of loxapine on D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Conclusion:This preclinical study reveals that loxapine receptorial spectrum is close to an \"atypical\" profile (D2/5HT2A ratio, 1.14).

The run time was 10\u00a0min and the retention time of the drug was around 4.6\u00a0min. Mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile and water (0.3% triethylamine) at pH 3.0 as 40:60 (v/v). Reference standard solutions (100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL) for both drugs were prepared by dissolving in mobile phases. These methods provide good linearity (R 2 = 0.999) over the range of 5-100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for methylphenidate hydrochloride and 0.1-100\u00a0\u00b5g/mL for loxapine succinate. The assay methods were successfully applied to study the deactivation of these drugs."}

The primary objective of this study was to develop a clinical trial protocol to support a phase I pharmacokinetic study in children aged 10\u00a0years and older. In addition, this report details the results of the clinical study in relation to the predicted likelihood of achieving the target exposure associated with therapeutic effect in adults. METHODS:A nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetic model was developed using adult data and was adjusted for the targeted pediatric age groups by applying allometric scaling to account for body size effects. Based on this pediatric model, age-appropriate regimens to achieve loxapine exposures similar to the ones associated with therapeutic effect in the adult studies were identified via trial simulation. D-optimal design and power analysis were conducted to identify optimal pharmacokinetic sampling times and sample size, respectively. RESULTS:The developed clinical trial design formed the basis of a phase I study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of loxapine for inhalation in children aged 10\u00a0years and older (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02184767). CONCLUSION:The results of the study indicated that overall loxapine exposures were consistent with what had been predicted by the trial simulations. The presented approach illustrates how modeling and simulation can assist in the design of informative clinical trials to identify safe and effective doses and dose ranges in children and adolescents."}

Recently, loxapine has been reformulated at a lower dose, producing an inhaled powder that can be directly administered to the lungs to treat the agitation associated with psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Thus, the aim of this narrative and clinical mini-review was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of inhaled loxapine in the treatment of acute agitation in patients with psychiatric disorders. The efficacy of inhaled loxapine has been evaluated in one Phase II trial on patients with schizophrenia, and in two Phase III trials in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Moreover, there are two published case series on patients with borderline personality disorder and dual diagnosis patients. Inhaled loxapine has proven to be effective and generally well tolerated when administered to agitated patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Two case series have suggested that inhaled loxapine may also be useful to treat agitation in patients with borderline personality disorder and with dual diagnosis, but further studies are needed to clarify this point. However, the administration of inhaled loxapine requires at least some kind of patient collaboration, and is not recommended in the treatment of severe agitation in totally uncooperative patients. Moreover, the drug-related risk of bronchospasm must always be kept in mind when planning to use inhaled loxapine, leading to a careful patient assessment prior to, and after, administration. Also, the higher costs of inhaled loxapine, when compared to oral and intramuscular medications, should be taken into account when selecting it for the treatment of agitation."}

During method development, several technical challenges such as poor chromatography, separation of structural isomers, and inadequate sensitivity were met and overcome. The final method utilized micro-elution solid phase extraction (SPE) to extract plasma samples (100\u03bcL), and the resulting extracts were analyzed using reversed phase LC-MS/MS using a turbo-ionspray interface in positive ionization mode with selected reaction monitoring (SRM). The method was fully validated according to the current regulatory guidance for bioanalysis over the calibration curve range 0.0500-50.0ng/mL for all analytes using 1/x2-weighted linear regression analysis. Based on three separate runs, the between-run precision and inter-day precision for all five analytes at all concentrations, including the LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) quality control at 0.0500ng/mL, varied from 0.0% to 13.8%, while the accuracy ranged from 86.4% to 109.3% of nominal. The extraction recoveries of loxapine and the four metabolites were above 80%. Various forms of short-term and long-term stability were established in both solutions and matrix, including the stability of loxapine and the four metabolites in human plasma for up to 260days of storage at -20\u00b0C. This method has been used to support a regulated clinical study, which included the successful execution of incurred sample reanalysis (ISR) testing.

{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "Sodium-activated potassium (KNa) channels contribute to firing frequency adaptation and slow after hyperpolarization. The KCNT1 gene (also known as SLACK) encodes a KNa subunit that is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Missense mutations of the SLACK C-terminus have been reported in several patients with rare forms of early onset epilepsy and in some cases severely delayed myelination. To date, such mutations identified in patients with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and Ohtahara syndrome (OS) have been reported to be gain-of-function mutations (Villa and Combi, 2016). An exome sequencing study identified a p.Phe932Ile KCNT1 mutation as the disease-causing change in a child with severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and abnormal myelination (Vanderver et al., 2014). We characterized an analogous mutation in the rat Slack channel and unexpectedly found this mutation to produce a loss-of-function phenotype. In an effort to restore current, we tested the known Slack channel opener loxapine. Loxapine exhibited no effect, indicating that this mutation either caused the channel to be insensitive to this established opener or proper translation and trafficking to the membrane was disrupted. Protein analysis confirmed that while total mutant protein did not differ from wild type, membrane expression of the mutant channel was substantially reduced. Although gain-of-function mutations to the Slack channel are linked to epileptic phenotypes, this is the first reported loss-of-function mutation linked to severe epilepsy and delayed myelination."}

Loxapine (LOX) in low doses of 5-15\u2009mg/day resembles an atypical antipsychotic (Stahl 2002 ). Our recent open pilot study of LOX found significant behavioral improvements and overall weight neutrality in 16 adolescents and adults with ASD. The present study examined an outpatient sample for LOX neuromotor tolerability.Consecutive outpatients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) ASD diagnoses receiving LOX were examined for tardive dyskinesia (TD) and extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) using the Dyskinesia Identification System: Condensed User Scale (DISCUS), and for akathisia using the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale. Data were also then retrospectively extracted from clinic charts regarding age, gender, diagnoses, LOX doses, treatment duration, concomitant medications, and LOX dosage reductions.Thirty-four subjects (25 male, 9 female) participated. Mean age was 23.4 years at LOX initiation (range 8-52). Thirteen subjects (38.2%) received loxapine for \u22655 years. Mean LOX dose was 8.9\u2009mg/day (range 5-30\u2009mg) and mean duration was 4.2 years (range 0.8-13). Fourteen subjects (41.2%) received concomitant atypical antipsychotics. Benztropine was prescribed in 5 of 34 subjects (14.7%). Three subjects manifested tics at baseline, but lower final DISCUS scores. Subject 26, with Prader-Willi syndrome, manifested TD. Apart from LOX 5\u2009mg daily he received paroxetine 40\u2009mg daily, which reduces LOX metabolism significantly. Akathisia objective scores were positive in 6 subjects (17.6%): Subject 2 scored 3 (pacing was present also at baseline); subjects 6, 7, and 11 each scored 1; and subjects 18 and 23 each scored 2. Six of 9 subjects (66.7%) with expressive language were positive for subjective akathisia.Low dose LOX was well tolerated, with lower than expected TD rates. This confirms clinical resemblance to an atypical antipsychotic. Individuals with neuromuscular problems including Prader-Willi Syndrome receiving LOX require close monitoring. Further study of LOX in ASD is warranted."}

This review examines the efficacy and tolerability of the various formulations of loxapine in the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients affected with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other psychiatric conditions. A comprehensive and systematic literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE was conducted, and relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data was included. The findings from the literature were critically reviewed and synthesized. The available data suggests that the antipsychotic efficacy of loxapine is similar to the efficacy of other typical or atypical antipsychotics, with an adverse effects profile comparable to that of the typical antipsychotics at high doses for chronic treatment. As an acute treatment in agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, inhaled loxapine was developed as an innovative and rapid option which appears to be efficacious and tolerable."}

By expression enrichment analysis, we identified that the expressions of antipsychotic target genes were significantly enriched in liver, brain, blood and corpus striatum. By protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, a PPI network with 77 significantly interconnected target genes was generated. By historeceptomics analysis, significant brain region specific target-drug interactions were identified in targets of dopamine receptors (DRD1-Olanzapine in caudate nucleus and pons (P-value<0.005), DRD2-Bifeprunox in caudate nucleus and pituitary (P-value<0.0005), DRD4-Loxapine in Pineal (P-value<0.00001)) and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (HTR2A-Risperidone in occipital lobe, prefrontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus (P-value<0.0001)).

We studied low dose loxapine prospectively in adolescents and adults with ASD and irritability. Additionally, we measured loxapine and metabolite concentrations, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a biomarker of neuromodulation. METHODS:We performed a 12 week open trial of add-on loxapine in subjects, ages 13-65 years, diagnosed with ASD, and Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale scores >14. Loxapine was dosed flexibly up to 15\u2009mg daily, starting with 5\u2009mg on alternate days. From weeks 1 to 6, other psychoactive medications were tapered if possible; from weeks 6 to 12, all medication doses were held stable. The primary outcome was the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement subscale (CGI-I), ratings of Much Improved or Very Much Improved. Secondary outcomes were the ABC-I, Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and Schalock Quality of Life scale. Serum BDNF and loxapine and metabolite concentrations were assayed. BDNF rs6265 was genotyped. RESULTS:Sixteen subjects were enrolled; 12 completed all visits. Median age was 18 years (range 13-39). Median final loxapine dose was 7.5\u2009mg/day (2.5-15). All 14 subjects (100%) with data at week 12 were rated as Much Improved on CGI-I at 12 weeks. Mean change on ABC-I at 12 weeks was -31%, p=0.01. Mean body mass index (BMI)-Z decreased between weeks 6 and 12, p=0.03. Side effects were minimal, and prolactin elevation occurred in only one subject. BDNF concentrations measured in 11 subjects increased significantly (p=0.04). Subjects with AG genotype for BDNF rs6265 required a lower dose of loxapine at study end, but had similar behavioral and BDNF concentration changes as the GG genotype.

METHODS: Pharmacokinetics and sedation pharmacodynamics using a visual analog scale were studied in 35 male and female adult subjects (18 nonsmokers and 17 smokers) following a single dose of 10 mg of inhaled loxapine. Blood samples were drawn at predose, 30 seconds, 1, 2, 3, 10, 30, and 60 minutes, and 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours after dosing. Loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine were analyzed using reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer. Pharmacokinetic parameters assessed included Cmax, Tmax, AUCinf, and T1/2 for loxapine and 8-OH-loxapine. Geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were determined for smokers to nonsmokers. RESULTS: Loxapine Cmax was similar in smokers and nonsmokers with a GMR of 99.0%. The median loxapine Tmax was 1.88 and 1.01 minutes for nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. Loxapine AUCinf and AUClast values in nonsmokers were comparable with smokers (GMRs of 85.3% and 86.7%, respectively). A slight decrease in the observed mean terminal half-life values was observed for smokers (6.52 hours for smokers and 7.30 hours for nonsmokers). CONCLUSIONS: Sedation profiles and visual analog scale scores at each time point were similar for nonsmokers and smokers. It was concluded that inhaled loxapine does not require dosage adjustment based on smoking behavior."}

Symptomatic bronchospasm occurred in 53.8% of subjects with asthma after inhaled loxapine and 11.5% after placebo; and in 19.2% of COPD subjects after inhaled loxapine and 11.1% after placebo. Subjects required inhaled albuterol as follows: asthma: 53.8% after inhaled loxapine and 11.5% after placebo; and COPD: 23.1% after inhaled loxapine and 14.8% after placebo. Respiratory signs/symptoms requiring treatment responded to rescue bronchodilator [forced expiratory volume in 1\u2009sec (FEV(1)) return to within 10% of baseline] within 1\u2009hr in 11 of 15 events in asthma subjects and four of seven events in COPD subjects, the remainder by the last spirometry.In subjects with either asthma or COPD, FEV(1) decline and bronchospasm can occur following inhaled loxapine, but more frequently in asthmatic subjects. Most subjects with bronchospasm responded to rescue bronchodilator within 1\u2009hr. No treatment-related serious AE occurred. Although inhaled loxapine is contraindicated in patients with active airways disease per the current approved US labeling, these studies demonstrated that rescue bronchodilator mitigated the symptomatic bronchospasms that may occur in case of inadvertent use."}

Medications used to treat agitation include antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, usually administered intramuscularly when rapid action is desired. Loxapine, a first-generation antipsychotic, has recently been reformulated into an inhaled powder that allows for direct administration to the lungs, resulting in rapid absorption into the systemic circulation. Administered via a single-use device, inhaled loxapine was tested in randomized controlled trials in agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania; doses of 5 mg and 10 mg were found to be efficacious, with an apparent dose response. In the Phase III studies, number needed to treat versus placebo for a \u226540% reduction from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Excited Component (PANSS-EC) at 2 hours was three for patients with bipolar disorder, and five for 5 mg and four for 10 mg for patients with schizophrenia, with effect sizes comparable to what has been observed in analogous studies of intramuscular injection of antipsychotics or lorazepam. Separation from placebo on the PANSS-EC was as early as 10 minutes postinhalation, the first time point where this was measured. Dysgeusia was the most commonly encountered spontaneously reported adverse event. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were relatively rare. Spirometry studies identified the potential for bronchospasm particularly in persons with asthma. Because of concerns over pulmonary safety, inhaled loxapine is restricted to use in hospitals and patients need to be prescreened for the presence of pulmonary disease, as well as monitored for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm for 1 hour postdose administration, as per a Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy."}

{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the efficacy of inhaled loxapine for the treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder using different examples of effect size (ES). DATA SOURCES: Psychopharmacologic Drug Advisory Committee briefing documents as prepared by the product manufacturer and by the US Food and Drug Administration. STUDY SELECTION: Phase III clinical trials. DATA EXTRACTION: Effect size for primary and secondary efficacy outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two similarly designed Phase III studies were completed with one conducted in patients with agitation associated with schizophrenia and one in patients with agitation associated with bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed episodes. In both studies, onset of anti-agitation effect was observed at 10 min (first time-point measured) for both the 5 mg and 10 mg doses, as evidenced by time to first statistically significant change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Excited Component (PEC) as compared to placebo. Loxapine remained superior to placebo throughout the remainder of the study at all-time points measured. In the schizophrenia study, the ES difference from placebo on the PEC at 2 h was 0.45 for the 5 mg dose and 0.60 for the 10 mg dose (Cohen's d). ES differences for Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) were similar. Prior to rounding up, the number needed to treat (NNT) for PEC response and CGI-I response vs. placebo were 4.1 and 4.6, respectively, for loxapine 5 mg and 3.2 and 3.2, respectively, for the 10 mg dose. For the outcome of requiring only one dose of study medication and no rescue medication, the NNT vs. placebo for the 5 mg dose was not statistically significant but was statistically significant for the 10 mg dose vs. placebo with a value of 7. When plotting the PEC responders over time NNT becomes more robust as time after dosing elapses, with the 10 mg dose reaching a NNT of 4 by 20 min. For the bipolar disorder study, the ES difference from placebo on the PEC at 2 h was 0.73 for the 5 mg dose and 0.94 for the 10 mg dose. ES differences for the CGI-I were somewhat higher. Prior to rounding up, NNT for response vs. placebo for PEC and CGI-I criteria were 2.9 and 2.6, respectively, for the loxapine 5 mg dose and 2.2 and 2.1, respectively, for the 10 mg dose. For the outcome of requiring only one dose of study medication and no rescue medication, the NNT vs. placebo for the 5 mg dose was 7 and for the 10 mg dose was 3. The NNT difference between 5 mg vs. 10 mg was statistically significant in favour of the 10 mg dose and had a value of 5. When plotting the PEC responders over time NNT becomes more robust as time after dosing elapses, with the 10 mg dose reaching a NNT of 3 by 20 min. Additional information regarding pulmonary safety demonstrated low rates of pulmonary adverse events among those subjects in the efficacy trials, however, in separate Phase I safety studies conducted in persons with asthma and COPD, respiratory symptoms and/or changes in flow parameters were common. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled loxapine is a non-invasive treatment option for the management of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Effect sizes for inhaled loxapine vs. placebo are robust and on par with those observed with intramuscular antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. Onset of action is rapid. The magnitudes of the effect sizes were generally larger for the 10 mg dose vs. the 5 mg dose, and the overall data supports the 10 mg dose as the dominant choice. The efficacy profile of inhaled loxapine will need to be viewed within the context of its pulmonary safety profile. The advisers to the Food and Drug Administration recommended that inhaled loxapine be restricted to a single dose in 24 h and be subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy programme."}
{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "Loxapine represents an interesting example of old \"new\" drug and is recently drawing attention for its novel inhalation formulation for the treatment of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric disorders. It is extensively metabolized to several active metabolites with diverging pharmacological properties. To further pursue the contribution of metabolites to the overall outcome after loxapine administration, quantification of both loxapine and its active metabolites is essential. The current study developed a rapid liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of loxapine and its five metabolites (amoxapine, 7-hydroxy-loxapine, 8-hydroxy-loxapine, 7-hydroxy-amoxapine and 8-hydroxy-amoxapine) in rat brain tissues, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By evaluating the effects of perchloric acid and methanol on analyte recovery, the extraction methods were optimized and only small amounts of sample (100 \u03bcl for plasma and less than 100mg for brain tissue) were required. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) in brain tissue were 3 ng/g for loxapine and amoxapine and 5 ng/g for the four hydroxylated metabolites of loxapine. The LLOQs were 1 ng/ml for loxapine and amoxapine and 2 ng/ml for the four hydroxylated metabolites in plasma, and 10 ng/ml for all analytes in CSF. The developed method was applied to a pharmacokinetic study on rats treated with a low-dose loxapine by oral administration. Four hours after loxapine dosing, high levels of 7-hydroxy-loxapine were found throughout the ten brain regions examined (68-124 ng/g), while only trace amount of loxapine was measured in brain (<5 ng/g) and plasma (<3 ng/ml). The method provides a useful tool for both preclinical and clinical investigations on the dispositions of loxapine and its metabolites, which would help to elucidate their roles in neurotherapeutics."}

Studies found that Slack channels were highly expressed in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons and modulated their firing frequency (J Neurosci 30:14165-14172, 2010). Therefore, Slack channel openers are of significant interest as putative analgesic drugs. We screened the library of pharmacologically active compounds with recombinant human Slack channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, by using rubidium efflux measurements with atomic absorption spectrometry. Riluzole at 500 \u03bcM was used as a reference agonist. The antipsychotic drug loxapine and the anthelmintic drug niclosamide were both found to activate Slack channels, which was confirmed by using manual patch-clamp analyses (EC(50) = 4.4 \u03bcM and EC(50) = 2.9 \u03bcM, respectively). Psychotropic drugs structurally related to loxapine were also evaluated in patch-clamp experiments, but none was found to be as active as loxapine. Loxapine properties were confirmed at the single-channel level with recombinant rat Slack channels. In dorsal root ganglion neurons, loxapine was found to behave as an opener of native K(Na) channels and to increase the rheobase of action potential. This study identifies new K(Na) channel pharmacological tools, which will be useful for further Slack channel investigations."}
{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "INTRODUCTION: Dysphagia is a common symptom in the general population, and even more among psychiatric patients, but rarely seen as a sign of seriousness. It is a cause of death by suffocation, and more or less serious complications, and therefore should be diagnosed and treated. Among psychiatric patients, organic and iatrogenic aetiologies, as well as risk factors are identified, which worsen this symptom when associated. It is now accepted that neuroleptics can aggravate or cause dysphagia. They act by several pathophysiological ways on the different components of swallowing, which can be identified by dynamic tests in the upper aerodigestive tract endoscopy. LITERATURE FINDINGS: This symptom is rarely reported by patients and often underestimated by caregivers. The frequency of swallowing disorders is not known. Dysphagia is a cause of complications and an increase in mortality rates among psychiatric patients. It has also been found that the average number of psychotropic drugs in patients who die by cafe coronary is significantly higher than in other patients. There are several phases in swallowing: oral, pharyngeal, and oesophageal. Swallowing disorders can affect each of these phases, or several at once: (a) Extrapyramidal syndrome: dysphagia is present in drug induced Parkinson's syndromes, but prevalence is not known. It is most often associated with another symptom of the extrapyramidal syndrome, but can also be isolated, making its diagnosis more difficult. Dysphagia is due to a slowing down in the oral and pharyngeal reflex, called bradykinesia; (b) Tardive dyskinesia: the oro-pharyngo-oesophageal dyskinesia is the most common type. Oesophageal dyskinesia causes asynchronous and random movements of the oesophagus, resulting in dysphagia. It appears mostly beyond 3 months of treatment with neuroleptics; (c) Acute laryngeal or oesophageal dystonia, associated or not with orofacial dystonia, is characterised by an impairment in the oesophageal muscle contraction and a hypertonia of the upper sphincter of the oesophagus; (d) Polyphagia or \"binge eating\", is frequent in psychotic patients; (e) Finally, there are risk factors for dysphagia: xerostomia, poor dental status, advanced age, neurological diseases, polypharmacy, sedative drugs, CNS depression, etc., which worsen the symptom. CASE REPORT: Mr J., aged 28, with no psychiatric history, is admitted to the Unit for Difficult Patients in Villejuif for behavioural disorder with homicide on the street. The patient was restrained by passers-by and suffers a head injury and a fracture of the transverse process of L1 vertebra. A cranial CT scan is performed in the emergency room, it is normal. The patient is not known to psychiatric services, and has never taken neuroleptics. Mr J. is homeless, known in his neighbourhood for \"his noisy delirium on the street and repeated alcohol abuse.\" After being arrested by the police in this context, a first psychiatric examination is conducted. The medical certificate states that his condition is not compatible with custody. Mr J. remains mute; he has stereotyped gestures and strange attitudes. No delusion is verbalized. He receives vials of loxapine 50mg causing sedation. At his arrival in the department, Mr J. has the same clinical picture, with a rigid and inexpressive face, reluctance, major unconformity, poor speech. The search for drugs in urine is positive for cannabis. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is rapidly raised, motivating further prescription of loxapine 300 mg daily in combination with clonazepam 6 mg daily. From the earliest days, dysphagia to solids with choking and regurgitation is noted, aggravated by the increase of loxapine treatment of 450 mg / day to 700 mg / day, 7 days after admission. A physical examination is performed before the worsening of dysphagia, it is normal, and in particular, reveals no extrapyramidal syndrome. An anti-cholinergic corrector is introduced, without clinical improvement. A new physical examination is performed; it is normal except for sedation and a slight deviation of the uvula. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy shows no anatomical lesion. No functional assessment of swallowing is done however. At this stage, the suspicion of neuroleptic induced dysphagia appears to be the most likely hypothesis. Treatment with loxapine is then stopped, resulting in a very rapid clinical improvement. Aripiprazole 15 mg / d is introduced. Dysphagia does not reoccur. DISCUSSION: Loxapine is an atypical antipsychotic, with a lower risk of neurological side effects than first generation of antipsychotics. These side effects are however numerous and from diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Loxapine is an antagonist of dopamine and serotonin which is involved in the regulation of several neurotransmitters, explaining the multiple mechanisms involved in the onset of dysphagia: first, blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum, causing motor side-effects of central origin, in addition to peripheral effects of the molecule, which impairs swallowing. In principle, the antagonist activity on serotonin 5-HT2A receptors increases dopaminergic activity in the striatum, reducing the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, without avoiding them completely. In addition to these mechanisms, cholinergic blockade reduces oesophageal mobility and pharyngeal reflex. Moreover, the antihistamine, anti-cholinergic and adrenergic receptor blocking alpha-1 can cause sedation, which aggravates the symptom. Finally, the depression of the bulbar centres reduces the swallowing reflex and gag reflex altering the intake of food. CONCLUSIONS: The swallowing disorder caused by neuroleptics may occur regardless of the molecule or drug class to which it belongs. It can be found even in the absence of any other neurological signs. It is important to search for the aetiological diagnosis for treatment. At the crossroads of several specialties, swallowing disorders are difficult to diagnose and treat. They are frequently underestimated, partly because patients rarely complain. In our case report, the diagnosis was ascertained by the removal of the medication, without functional evidence, probably by a lack of collaboration between the physician and the endoscopist who had not performed any dynamic investigation of swallowing. This case illustrates the importance of knowing the different mechanisms underlying dysphagia in psychiatric patients, and good communication with gastroenterologists to establish a precise diagnosis of the disorder, and adapt the therapy."}
{"keyword": "Loxapine", "texts": "INTRODUCTION: Interruption of sedation during weaning from mechanical ventilation often leads to patient agitation because of withdrawal syndrome. We tested the short-term efficacy and tolerance of loxapine in this situation. METHODS: Nineteen mechanically ventilated patients with marked agitation after sedation withdrawal were included. Three agitation scales, the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), the Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MAAS), and the Ramsay and physiological variables (respiratory rate, airway occlusion pressure during the first 0.1 second of inspiration (P0.1), heart rate and systolic arterial blood pressure) were recorded before and after loxapine administration. RESULTS: Loxapine dramatically improved all agitation scores (RASS and MASS decreased from 2 +/- 0 to -1.1 +/- 2.3, and 5.4 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 1.6, respectively; Ramsay increased from 1.0 +/- 0 to 3.5 +/- 1.5, 60 minutes after loxapine administration, P < 0.05 for all scores) as well as P0.1 (6 +/- 4.2 to 1.8 +/- 1.8 cm H2O; P < 0.05) and respiratory rate (from 31.2 +/- 7.2 to 23.4 +/- 7.8; P < 0.05) without hemodynamic adverse events. No side effects occurred. Sixteen (84%) patients were successfully managed with loxapine, sedation was resumed in two others, and one patient self-extubated without having to be reintubated. CONCLUSIONS: Loxapine was safe and effective in treating agitation in a small group of mechanically ventilated patients and improved respiratory physiologic parameters, enabling the weaning process to be pursued. A multicenter trial is under way to confirm these promising results."}

Emitted dose values were approximately 90% of the coated dose at every condition, meeting target specifications in each case. Aerosol purity was consistently >99.5% for every test setting, with no reportable impurities according to ICH standards (>0.1%). Particle size averaged 2\u03bcm (MMAD) and was independent of the different test conditions with the exception of different airflow rates. Particle size decreased slightly with airflow, which may assist in maintaining constant deep lung deposition.

Central composite design was applied to optimize the formulation variables; lipid X1 (Glyceryl monostearate) and surfactant X2 (Poloxamer: Tween 80). The particle sizes were in the nanometer range and spherical shaped for all prepared solid lipid nanoparticles formulations and the zeta potential absolute values were high, predicting good long-term stability. In vitro study of olmesartan loaded solid lipid nanoparticle exhibited controlled release profile for at least 24\u202fh. The rate and extent of drug diffusion was studied using dialysis sac, rat's stomach and intestine tissues; study demonstrated that drug release from the solid lipid nanoparticles was significantly higher than drug suspension. In vivo pharmacokinetic study of olmesartan loaded solid lipid nanoparticles revealed higher Cmax of 1610\u202fng/mL, higher AUC of 15492.50\u202fng/mL and increased relative bioavailability by almost 2.3 folds compared to marketed formulation. These results clearly indicate that olmesartan loaded solid lipid nanoparticles are shown to have enhanced bioavailability and effective therapeutic result and thus would be an excellent way to treat hypertension. Hence, these solid lipid nanoparticles could represent as a great potential for a possible alternative to conventional oral formulation in the treatment of hypertension."}

Bootstrap and visual predictive check were used simultaneously to validate the final population pharmacokinetic models. The covariates included age, sex, body surface area (BSA), bodyweight, height, creatinine clearance (CLCR) as an index of renal function and liver parameters as indices of hepatic function.A total of 205 olmesartan plasma sample concentrations from 69 patients with hypertension were collected in this study. The pharmacokinetic data of olmesartan was well described by a two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption and an absorption lag-time. The mean values of CL/F and V/F of olmesartan in the patients were 0.31565\u00a0L/h and 44.5162\u00a0L, respectively. Analysis of covariates showed that age and CLCR were factors influencing the clearance of olmesartan and the volume of distribution of olmesartan was dependent on age and BSA.The final population pharmacokinetic model was demonstrated to be appropriate and effective and it can be used to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of olmesartan in Indian patients with hypertension."}

The optimized formulation exhibited irregular morphology as evaluated by scanning electron microscopy and was crystalline as determined by thermal analysis and powder X-ray diffraction studies. OLM nanocrystals showed a marked increase in the saturation solubility as well as rapid dissolution rate in comparison with the pure drug. No significant change in the particle size, PDI, and zeta potential was observed when optimized formulation was stored at room and refrigeration conditions for 3\u00a0months. Lastly, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Sprague-Dawley rats substantiate the ability of OLM nanocrystal formulation to significantly improve (\u223c4.6-fold) the oral bioavailability of OLM in comparison with the free drug.

In addition, the olmesartan nanoemulsion was found to be safe and non-toxic, as it neither produced any lethality nor remarkable haematological, biochemical and structural adverse effects as observed during the 28-days sub-chronic toxicity studies in experimental Wistar rats. It is herewith envisaged that the developed nanoemulsion formulation approach for the delivery of olmesartan medoxomil via oral route can further be explored in memory dysfunction and brain ischemia, for better brain penetration and improved clinical application in stroke patients."}

Independent variables include: concentration of drug (X1), concentration of surfactant (X2), concentration of polymer (X3) and number of homogenization cycles (X4). Based on preliminary studies, the size (Y1), zeta potential (ZP) (Y2) and % drug release at 5\u2009min (Y3) were chosen as dependent responses. OM-NS was prepared by high pressure homogenization method. The size, PDI, ZP, assay, in vitro release and morphology of OM-NS were characterized. Further, the pharmacokinetic (PK) behavior of OM-NS was evaluated in male wistar rats. Statistically optimized OM-NS formulation exhibited mean particle size of 492\u2009nm, ZP of -27.9\u2009mV and 99.29% release in 5\u2009min. OM-NS showed more than four times increase in its solubility than pure OM. DSC and XRD analyses indicated that the drug incorporated into OM-NS was in amorphous form. The morphology of OM-NS was found to be nearly spherical with high dispersity by scanning electron microscopic studies. The PK results showed that OM lyophilized nanosuspension (NS) exhibited improved PK properties compared to coarse powder suspension and marketed tablet powder suspension (TS). Oral bioavailability of lyophilized NS was increased by 2.45 and 2.25 folds when compared to marketed TS and coarse powder suspension, respectively.

To analyze the concentration of S-amlodipine or olmesartan, plasma samples were collected up to 144 hours after the dose for S-amlodipine and 48 hours after the dose for olmesartan. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including the Cmax and the area under the curve from time 0 to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-last) for the time versus concentration plot, were calculated. Analysis of variance for bioequivalence was conducted using Cmax and AUC0-last converted to log scale, and the mean ratios and 90% CIs were determined. Safety data included analysis of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory test, and 12-lead ECGs.Of the 32 enrolled participants, 29 healthy volunteers completed the study. For both S-amlodipine and olmesartan, the main pharmacokinetic parameters were all within the acceptable range for regulatory bioequivalence. The 90% CIs for the geometric mean ratios of Cmax and AUC0-last were 0.8766 to 0.9760 and 0.8288 to 0.9224, respectively, for S-amlodipine and 0.9097 to 1.1229 and 0.8904 to 1.0407, respectively, for olmesartan.

This study was performed to evaluate the effect of olmesartan medoxomil (OM) on lung injury induced in rats by AD which was assessed biochemically (hydroxyproline content, MDA level and SOD activity), histologically (Ashcroft criteria and Masson's trichrome stain) and immunohistochemically (TGF-\u03b21 expression in lung tissue). The expression levels of TGF-\u03b21 and type I collagen mRNA were also determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Forty-eight adult male rats were randomized into six equal groups: control group, OM control groups, AD group received 40 mg/kg/day, p.o. for 4 weeks to induce pulmonary injury in rats and OM-treated groups received 0.6 and 6 mg/kg/day, p.o. concomitantly with AD for the same period. The results indicated that OM significantly decreased collagen deposition and hydroxyproline content, ameliorated pathological score and decreased the elevation in type I collagen and TGF-\u00df1 mRNA expression in lung tissue. Furthermore, it attenuated the AD-induced increase in the MDA level and increased SOD activity in lung tissue. It can be concluded that OM exerts a protective effect against AD-induced lung damage in rats which is attributed to modulation of pro-fibrogenic cytokine (TGF-\u03b21) and antioxidant effect."}

Most of the studies investigating the effects of atherosclerosis focused on early atherosclerotic lesions, whereas lesions in human disease, at the time when medical treatment is started, are already well established. Therefore, we set up a model of advanced atherosclerosis and investigated the effects of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine besylate, and the combination of both on atherosclerotic lesion size and lesion composition.Olmesartan medoxomil (1 mg/kg/day), amlodipine besylate (1.5 mg/kg/day), and the combination of both was added to chow and was fed to apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE(-/-)) mice at 25 weeks of age. Mice were sacrificed after 25 weeks of drug administration and perfused with formalin. Innominate arteries were dissected out and paraffin embedded. Serial sections were generated, and lesion sizes and their composition - such as minimal thickness of the fibrous cap, size of the necrotic core, and presence of calcification - were analyzed. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in aortic tissue.Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate led to a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size in ApoE(-/-) mice (olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine besylate: 122,277\u00b16,795 \u03bcm(2), number [n]=14; versus control: 177,502\u00b110,814 \u03bcm(2), n=9; P<0.001). Treatment with amlodipine besylate (n=5) alone did not reach significance. However, a trend toward a decrease in lesion size in the amlodipine besylate-treated animals could be observed. In the histological analysis of atherosclerotic lesion composition, significantly thicker fibrous caps were found in treatment with amlodipine besylate (amlodipine: 5.12\u00b10.26 \u03bcm, n=6; versus control: 3.98\u00b10.18 \u03bcm, n=10; P<0.01). Furthermore, all sections revealed morphological signs of calcification, but no difference could be detected. Treatment with the combination of olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate showed no effect on lesion composition. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays of nuclear extracts demonstrated reduced activity of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB when treated with olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine besylate, or their combination, as compared to controls.Combined treatment with olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine besylate attenuated atherosclerotic lesion progression, possibly due to anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Our data support the hypothesis that even in advanced atherosclerosis anti-inflammatory treatment, using angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and calcium channel antagonists of the dihydropyridine type can attenuate atherosclerotic lesion progression."}

Initial preformulation studies, risk assessment and factor screening studies revealed selection of oleic acid, Tween 40 and Transcutol HP as the critical factors. Systematic optimization of SNEOFs was carried out employing D-optimal mixture design and evaluating them for responses viz. emulsification efficiency, globule size and in vitro drug release. The CSNEOFs were prepared from the optimized SNEOFs by adding oleylamine as cationic charge inducer. In vitro cell line studies revealed markedly better drug uptake along with safer and biocompatible nature of CSNEOFs than free drug suspension. In situ perfusion, and in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in Wistar rats revealed significant improvement in the biopharmaceutical performance of the drug from CSNEOFs and SNEOFs vis-\u00e0-vis the marketed formulation. Successful establishment of various levels of in vitro/in vivo correlations (IVIVC) substantiated high degree of prognostic ability of in vitro dissolution conditions in predicting the in vivo performance.

The impurities were identified as N-1- and N-2-(5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl derivatives of OM. Both compounds, of which N-2 isomer of olmesartan dimedoxomil is a novel impurity of OM, were synthesized and fully characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry/electrospray ionization (HRMS/ESI). Their \u00b9H, (13)C and (15)N nuclear magnetic resonance signals were fully assigned. The molecular structures of N-triphenylmethylolmesartan ethyl (N-tritylolmesartan ethyl) and N-tritylolmesartan medoxomil, the key intermediates in OM synthesis, were solved and refined using single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The SCXRD study revealed that N-tritylated intermediates of OM exist exclusively as one of the two possible regioisomers. In molecular structures of these regioisomers, the trityl substituent is attached to the N-2 nitrogen atom of the tetrazole ring, and not to the N-1 nitrogen, as has been widely reported up to the present. This finding indicates that the reported structural formula of N-tritylolmesartan ethyl and N-tritylolmesartan medoxomil, as well as their systematic chemical names, must be revised. The careful analysis of literature spectroscopic data for other sartan intermediates and their analogs with 5-(biphenyl-2-yl)tetrazole moiety showed that they also exist exclusively as N-2-trityl regioisomers."}

It is highly lipophilic (log P 5.5) and a poorly water-soluble drug with absolute bioavailability of 26%. The poor dissolution rate of water-insoluble drugs is still a major problem confronting the pharmaceutical industry. The objective of the present investigation was to develop liquisolid compacts for olmesartan medoxomil to improve the dissolution rate. Liquisolid compacts were prepared using Acrysol El 135 as a solvent, Avicel PH 102, Fujicalin and Neusilin as carrier materials, and Aerosil as coating material in different ratios. The interaction between drug and excipients was characterized by DSC and FT-IR studies, which showed that there is no interaction between drug and excipients. The powder characteristics were evaluated by different flow parameters to comply with pharmacopoeial limits. The dissolution studies for liquisolid compacts and conventional formulations were carried out, and it was found that liquisolid compacts with 80%\u2009w/w of Acrysol EL 135 to the drug showed significant higher drug release rates than conventional tablets. Amongst carriers used Fujicalin and Neusilin were found to be more effective carrier materials for liquid adsorption."}

Three-way dataset of HCT and OLM in their binary mixtures containing telmisartan (IS) as an internal standard was recorded with a UPLC-PDA instrument. Firstly, the PARAFAC algorithm was applied for the decomposition of three-way UPLC-PDA data into the chromatographic, spectral and concentration profiles to quantify the concerned compounds. Secondly, 3W-PLS1 approach was subjected to the decomposition of a tensor consisting of three-way UPLC-PDA data into a set of triads to build 3W-PLS1 regression for the analysis of the same compounds in samples. For the proposed three-way analysis methods in the regression and prediction steps, the applicability and validity of PARAFAC and 3W-PLS1 models were checked by analyzing the synthetic mixture samples, inter-day and intra-day samples, and standard addition samples containing HCT and OLM. Two different three-way analysis methods, PARAFAC and 3W-PLS1, were successfully applied to the quantitative estimation of the solid dosage form containing HCT and OLM.

References from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Dipiro's Pharmacotherapy eighth edition textbook were also reviewed.Data Synthesis:There have been recent implications of olmesartan medoxomil being linked to symptoms mimicking celiac disease. Investigators first identified the association in 22 patients who presented with presumed refractory celiac disease. Upon further evaluation, it was discovered that these symptoms improved when olmesartan was discontinued. In response to this report, additional case studies have been published. DeGaetani et al also further analyzed patients with seronegative villous atrophy from the Celiac Disease Center and found that olmesartan accounted for 22% of previously unclassified sprue cases. Conversely, the authors of the ROADMAP trial, which compared olmesartan to placebo, found no significant differences in the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.Conclusions:There is growing evidence supporting the association between olmesartan and sprue-like symptoms; however, further research is warranted. These symptoms can be life threatening and clinicians should be aware of the potential association."}

Quality target method profile was defined and critical analytical attributes (CAAs) for the reverse-phase liquid chromatography method earmarked. Chromatographic separation accomplished on a C18 column using acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% orthophosphoric acid, pH 3.5) in 40 : 60 (v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min with UV detection at 243 nm. Risk assessment studies and screening studies facilitated comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting CAAs. The mobile phase ratio and flow rate were identified as critical method parameters (CMPs) and were systematically optimized using face-centered cubic design, evaluating for CAAs, namely peak area, retention time, theoretical plates and peak tailing. Statistical modelization was accomplished followed by response surface analysis for comprehending plausible interaction(s) among CMPs. Search for optimum solution was conducted through numerical and graphical optimization for demarcating the design space. Analytical method validation and subsequent forced degradation studies corroborated the method to be highly efficient for routine analysis of drug and its degradation products. The studies successfully demonstrate the utility of QbD approach for developing the highly sensitive liquid chromatographic method with enhanced method performance."}

METHODS: The 3-in-1 study was separated into 2 stages. Stage 1 is a four-period crossover study. 28 healthy subjects were equally randomized into four groups. Each group received the four following regimens in a sequence as Latin square (4 \u00d7 4) design: A: olmesartan medoxomil; B: HCTZ; C: test drug (new combined formulation); D: reference drugs (co-administration of separate tablets). In stage 2, half of 28 subjects were daily dosed with regimen C for 7 days. Blood and urine samples were obtained to receive pharmacokinetics of olmesartan and HCTZ, which were analyzed using the BE evaluation method. Tolerability was also assessed. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study and nobody reported serious adverse event (SAE). The 90% confidence intervals (CI) of geometric mean ratio (GMR) of log transformed Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-\u221e after single dose showed no DDI and claimed BE. The mean ratio of accumulation (Ra) (SD) of olmesartan and HCTZ after multiple doses of new combination formulation is 1.03 (0.182) and 0.954 (0.128). CONCLUSIONS: No significant DDI between olmesartan and HCTZ was found. The new combination formulation is bioequivalent to co-administration of two separate local tablets. After multiple doses of the new combination formulation, no significant accumulation was observed. The new combination formulation is reasonably tolerated well in healthy Chinese subjects after multiple doses."}

Experimental MI models were established in the mice of the MI and OLM groups by coronary artery ligation, and the mice in the OLM group were fed a daily dose of 10 mg/kg OLM for eight weeks. The results showed that MI induced a reduction in cardiac function and an increase in systolic blood pressure. In addition, increased periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive staining, combined with increased levels of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the plasma and kidneys, and increased expression levels of renin, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensinogen (AGT) in the kidney tissues was observed compared with those in the SHAM group. OLM treatment attenuated the injury by reducing the systolic blood pressure and PAS positive staining, and decreasing the expression levels of Ang II, renin, AT1R and AGT in the kidney compared with those in the MI group.

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "The study describes the development and validation of a new microwell-based spectrophotometric assay for determination of olmesartan medoxomil (OLM) in tablets. The formation of a colored charge-transfer (CT) complex between OLM as an n-electron donor and 2,3-dichloro- -5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) as a p-electron acceptor was investigated, and employed as the basis for the development of the new assay. The proposed assay was conducted in 96-microwell plates. The absorbance of the colored-CT complex was measured at 460 nm with a microplate reader. Optimum conditions of the reaction and the analytical procedures of the assay were established. Under the optimum conditions, a linear relationship with a good correlation coefficient was found between the absorbance and the concentration of OLM in the range of 2-200 \u03bcg per well. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.53 and 1.61 \u03bcg per well, respectively. No interference was observed from the excipients present in OLM tablets or from hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine besylate that were co-formulated with OLM in some of its formulations. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of OLM in tablets with good accuracy and precision. The assay described herein has a great practical value in the routine analysis of OLM in quality control laboratories, since it has a high throughput property and consumes low volumes of organic solvent. It thus offers a reduction in the exposure of analysts to the toxic effects of organic solvents, as well as a reduction in the cost of analysis."}

In hypertension, cEPCs number is reduced and function impaired adding further risk for cardiovascular (CV) events. Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced oxidative stress (OxSt), accelerates cEPCs senescence. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), able to prevent and reverse Ang II-induced cEPCs senescence, is reduced in hypertension and stimulated by the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory heme oxygenase (HO)-1. In essential hypertensive patients olmesartan reduced OxSt and markers of CV remodeling and increased HO-1. This study reports in essential hypertensive patients the effect of 6 months treatment with olmesartan on plasma level of CGRP and number and survival of cEPCs.In 20 essential hypertensive patients treated with olmesartan medoxomil (20\u200a mg per day for 6 months), cEPCs (CD34(+)KDR(+), CD133(+)KDR(+) and CD34(+)CD133(+)KDR(+)) (direct 3-color flow cytometry analysis), apoptosis of cEPCs (CD133(+)KDR(+) cells with Annexin V expression), CGRP determination (ELISA) and HO-1 protein level (western blot) were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of treatments. Olmesartan normalized blood pressure (P\u200a<\u200a0.001), increased cEPCs from baseline (CD34(+)KDR(+): P\u200a<\u200a0.003; CD133(+)KDR(+): P\u200a<\u200a0.0002; CD34(+)CD133(+)KDR(+): P\u200a=\u200a0.0008), reduced cEPCs apoptosis (P\u200a<\u200a0.001) and increased CGRP (P\u200a<\u200a0.013) and HO-1 (P\u200a=\u200a0.039).These results provide a mechanistic rationale for the olmesartan's antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential translation toward antiatherosclerotic and antiremodeling effects reported on clinical ground."}

METHODS: Plasma concentrations of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were measured in 41 healthy volunteers enrolled in our bioequivalence study by LC-MS/MS following oral administration of an olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg) fixed-dose combination tablet. This data and covariates were subjected to nonlinear mixed-effect modeling analysis using the NONMEM software. Evaluation featured a visual predicted check and bootstrapping. RESULTS: The distributions of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were best fitted using a two-compartment model with no lag time and first-order elimination. When analyzing hydrochlorothiazide kinetics, we found that TCHO and CL/F were correlated, while. HB and Ka influenced olmesartan medoxomil modeling. All evaluations indicated that the pharmacokinetic profiles of olmesartan medoxomil and hydrochlorothiazide were adequately described using our PPK model. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that demographic factors influence the inter-individual variability in the disposition of the combination drug, and it might be more useful to apply it to the PK of olmesartan medoxomil/hydrochlorothiazide (20/12.5 mg) FDC tablets administered to patients with hypertension. *These two authors contributed equally to this work."}

Method (C) based on successive spectrophotometric resolution technique (SSRT). The technique starts with the ratio subtraction method then measuring OL and HZ at their isoabsorptive point at 260.0 nm, while HZ is measured using the amplitude of first derivative at 335.2 nm. Method (D) is mean centering of the ratio spectra (MCR) at 252.0 nm and 220.0 nm for OL and HZ, respectively. The specificity of the developed methods is investigated by analyzing laboratory prepared mixtures containing different ratios of the three drugs and their combined dosage form.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Eligible obese (body mass index \u226530\u2009kg/m(2); n\u2009=\u2009505) and non-obese (<30\u2009kg/m(2); n\u2009=\u2009494) patients were switched to AML/OM 5/20\u2009mg and uptitrated at 4-week intervals to AML/OM 5/40\u2009mg, AML/OM 10/40\u2009mg, AML/OM 10/40\u2009mg\u2009+\u2009HCTZ 12.5\u2009mg, and AML/OM 10/40\u2009mg\u2009+\u2009HCTZ 25\u2009mg. Uptitration to higher doses of AML/OM was permitted if mean seated systolic BP (SeSBP) was \u2265120\u2009mmHg, or mean seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) was \u226570\u2009mmHg. HCTZ was added if mean SeSBP was \u2265125\u2009mmHg, or mean SeDBP was \u226575\u2009mmHg. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00791258 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy endpoint was the cumulative proportion of patients achieving SeSBP <140\u2009mmHg (<130\u2009mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included seated cuff BP (SeBP) goal rates, ambulatory BP target rates, and mean change from baseline in SeBP and ambulatory BP at weeks 12 and 20. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, 71.6% of obese patients (80.2% non-obese) achieved the primary endpoint of cumulative SeSBP <140\u2009mmHg (<130\u2009mmHg for patients with diabetes). The cumulative SeBP goal of <140/90\u2009mmHg (<130/80\u2009mmHg if diabetes) was achieved by 64.8% and 81.2% of obese patients by weeks 12 and 20, respectively (vs. 77.9% and 88.5% of non-obese patients, respectively). Treatment was well-tolerated, with 26.1% of obese patients (24.9% non-obese) experiencing drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). There were no serious drug-related TEAEs.

PATIENTS OR PARTICIPANTS: Individuals > or =18 years of age with mean seated blood pressure (BP) > or =140/100 or > or =160/90 mm Hg divided into Hispanic/Latino (369) and non-Hispanic/Latino (2122) subgroups. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to OM 40/AML 10 mg, OM 40/HCTZ 25 mg, AML 10/HCTZ 25 mg, or OM 40/AML 10/HCTZ 25 mg during the double-blind phase. During the open-label extension, all participants received OM 40/AML 5/HCTZ 12.5 mg; participants not reaching BP goal within 2 weeks were randomly titrated to OM 40/AML 10/HCTZ 12.5 mg or OM 40/AML 5/HCTZ 25 mg, then to OM 40/AML 10/ HCTZ 25 mg after another 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in mean seated diastolic BP (SeDBP) from baseline (double-blind phase). RESULTS: Triple-drug therapy vs the dual therapies resulted in greater mean reduction in SeBP (Hispanic/Latino: 35.0/20.9 mm Hg vs 27.8-30.9/15.3-17.7 mm Hg; non-Hispanic/Latino: 39.0/21.7 mm Hg vs 28.9-31.5/14.6-17.8 mm Hg) and enabled more participants to reach BP goal (Hispanic/Latino: 56.8% vs 40.6%-51.2%; non-Hispanic/Latino: 65.7% vs 33.8%-46.6%) irrespective of ethnicity. The efficacy of triple-drug therapy in achieving BP goal was sustained long-term (40-week open-label extension period) in Hispanic/Latino (63.3%) and non-Hispanic/ Latino (64.2%) participants.

METHODS: The 3 studies followed open prospective cohort designs that represented daily clinical practice in Japan. Patients with CKD at baseline were selected. Change of BP, eGFR and proteinuria on OLM therapy or AZ therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, OLM (n=1,317) and AZ (n=952) therapies exhibited similar BP-lowering effects. AZ led to a significantly (p=0.0069) greater increase of eGFR compared with OLM, while OLM tended to improve proteinuria to a greater extent than AZ. Treatment with OLM for 2 years (n=109) significantly improved proteinuria but did not alter eGFR. CONCLUSION: This study shows that OLM and AZ reduced BP and proteinuria without decreasing eGFR in Japanese hypertensive patients with CKD in the setting of daily clinical practice."}

Many therapies are used, but side effects and loss of response limit long-term effectiveness. New therapeutic strategies are thus needed for patients who don't respond to current treatments. Recently, there is suggested involvement of the proinflammatory hormone angiotensin II in inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of olmesartan medoxomil (OLM-M), an angiotensin II receptor blocker in ameliorating ulcerative colitis. Colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by administration of 5% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in drinking water for 5days. OLM-M (1, 3 and 10mg/kg) was administered orally during 21days prior to the induction of colitis, and for 5days after. Sulfasalazine (500mg/kg) was used as reference drug. All animals were tested for changes in colon length, disease activity index (DAI) and microscopic damage. Colon tissue concentration/activity of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-\u03b1), myeloperoxidase (MPO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) were assessed. Results showed that the OLM-M dose-dependently ameliorated the colonic histopathological and biochemical injuries, an effect that is comparable or even better than that of the standard sulfasalazine. These results suggest that olmesartan medoxomil may be effective in the treatment of UC through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."}

METHODS: The study included a 3-4-week placebo run-in and an 8-week active treatment period: OM (weeks 1-4, OM 20 mg; weeks 5-8, OM 40 mg); placebo + OM (weeks 1-2, placebo; weeks 3-4, OM 20 mg; weeks 5-8, OM 40 mg); and LOS (weeks 1-4, LOS 50 mg; weeks 5-8, LOS 100 mg). Analyses focused on comparison of OM and placebo + OM combined versus LOS. Efficacy endpoints were mean change from baseline in seated cuff diastolic blood pressure (SeDBP) at week 8 (primary); seated cuff systolic blood pressure (SeSBP) at weeks 4 and 8, and SeDBP at week 4 (secondary), and BP target achievement (tertiary). RESULTS: The randomized population (n = 941) had a mean \u00b1 SD age of 51.9 \u00b1 9.7 years, 54.5% were male, and 20.1% were na\u00efve to antihypertensive medication. For treatmentna\u00efve subjects, baseline seated BP (SeBP) (\u00b1SD) was 157.4 (\u00b110.9)/101.8 (\u00b14.3) mmHg with OM and 156.3 (\u00b110.8)/101.1 (\u00b13.9) mmHg with LOS, while non-na\u00efve subjects had 158.4 (\u00b110.2)/100.9 (\u00b14.0) mmHg with OM and 158.8 (\u00b110.1)/101.3 (\u00b14.2) mmHg with LOS. OM monotherapy produced significantly greater changes in least-squares mean (\u00b1SE) SeDBP compared with LOS in both treatment-na\u00efve (-9.7 [1.0] vs. -6.6 [1.0] mmHg; P = 0.0232 vs. LOS) and non-na\u00efve subjects (-9.6 [0.5] vs. -7.3 [0.5] mmHg; P = 0.0013 vs. LOS). A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved the SeBP goal of <140/90 mmHg with OM compared with LOS in treatment-na\u00efve (34.1% vs. 19.0%, respectively; P = 0.0109) and non-na\u00efve subjects (31.0% vs. 19.6%; P = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: Overall, OM monotherapy resulted in significantly greater SeBP reductions and greater SeBP goal achievement than LOS, irrespective of previous medication use. Both OM and LOS therapy were well tolerated."}

Subjects received a single oral dose of an olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg tablet on Day 1 under fasting conditions, and after a wash-out period they received the same dose once daily from Day 15 to Day 24. Serial blood samples were collected at predefined time-points to measure the plasma concentrations of olmesartan and amlodipine during the single-dose and the multiple-dose period. Meanwhile, blood pressure and heart rate were repeatedly taken to delineate the pharmacodynamic profiles. Safety was assessed throughout the study.After oral administration, the peak concentrations of olmesartan and amlodipine were reached in a median time of 2 and 6\u00a0h, respectively. The elimination half-life of amlodipine is more than twice as long as that of olmesartan. Steady states of both compounds were attained after once-daily dosing for 8\u00a0days. Similar significant reductions of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were observed after a single dose of an olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg FDC tablet. In comparison, multiple doses of olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg tablets lowered the daily pre-dose BP level and led to smaller BP changes after the last dose. Heart rate increments were larger and more sustained after multiple doses than during the single-dose period. Females showed more systolic BP reductions than males despite inter-sex similarity in pharmacokinetics. Treatment with olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg FDC tablets was safe and well tolerated.After single and multiple doses of olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg FDC tablets the pharmacokinetic profiles of olmesartan or amlodipine were comparable to those reported for monotherapy with olmesartan medoxomil or amlodipine, except that the elimination half-life of olmesartan was longer because of the longer time course over which pharmacokinetic blood sampling was carried out in this study. The response profiles of BP indicate a concentration-dependent antihypertensive effect of the olmesartan medoxomil/amlodipine 20\u00a0mg/5\u00a0mg FDC tablet after a single dose and stabilization of such effects after multiple doses."}

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "Hypertension affects approximately 26% of the world's adult population and is a recognized major risk factor for morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases. However, despite the availability of a range of effective antihypertensive agents and a growing awareness of the consequences of high blood pressure (BP), the treatment and control of hypertension remains suboptimal. A number of patient subgroups are categorized as 'high risk' and may have hypertension that is more difficult to treat, including obese individuals, patients with stage 2 hypertension, those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), patients with coronary artery disease or a history of stroke, and Black patients. As the benefits of lowering BP in patients with hypertension are unequivocal, particularly in high-risk patients, treating high-risk patients with hypertension to BP goals and maintaining 24-hour BP control is important to help reduce cardiovascular risk and improve outcomes. Although the BP goals recommended in current consensus guidelines for the management of patients with hypertension are based on cuff BP measurements, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) provides a valuable diagnostic tool and allows a more accurate assessment of BP levels throughout the 24-hour dosing period. ABPM is a better predictor of prognosis than office BP measurement and is also useful for assessing whether antihypertensive therapy remains effective in the critical last few hours of the dosing period, which usually coincides with the morning BP surge associated with arousal and arising. ABPM has been adopted by new evidence-based guidelines in the United Kingdom to confirm a suspected diagnosis of hypertension, which is an indication of the growing importance of ABPM in the management of hypertension. This review provides an overview of the efficacy and safety of antihypertensive therapy based on olmesartan medoxomil\u2009\u00b1\u2009hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil in high-risk patient populations enrolled in studies that reported ambulatory BP endpoints. The studies identified in this review showed that a titrate-to-BP goal strategy using olmesartan medoxomil- or amlodipine/olmesartan medoxomil-based antihypertensive therapy was an effective and well-tolerated approach for maintaining BP control throughout the full 24-hour dosing period in high-risk patients with difficult-to-treat hypertension."}

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major factor in mortality rates around the world and contributes to more than one-third of deaths in the US. The underlying cause of CV disease is atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory process that is clinically manifested as coronary artery disease, carotid artery disease, or peripheral artery disease. It has been predicted that atherosclerosis will be the primary cause of death in the world by 2020. Consequently, developing a treatment regimen that can slow or even reverse the atherosclerotic process is imperative. Atherogenesis is initiated by endothelial injury due to oxidative stress associated with CV risk factors including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Since the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in vascular inflammatory responses, hypertension treatment with RAAS-blocking agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs] and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]) may slow inflammatory processes and disease progression. Reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability has an important role in the process of endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Therefore, agents that increase NO and decrease oxidative stress, such as ARBs and ACEIs, may interfere with atherosclerosis. Studies show that angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonism with an ARB improves endothelial function and reduces atherogenesis. In patients with hypertension, the ARB olmesartan medoxomil provides effective blood pressure lowering, with inflammatory marker studies demonstrating significant RAAS suppression. Several prospective, randomized studies show vascular benefits with olmesartan medoxomil: reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with stable angina pectoris (OLIVUS); decreased vascular inflammatory markers in patients with hypertension and micro- (pre-clinical) inflammation (EUTOPIA); improved common carotid intima-media thickness and plaque volume in patients with diagnosed atherosclerosis (MORE); and resistance vessel remodeling in patients with stage 1 hypertension (VIOS). Although CV outcomes were not assessed in these studies, the observed benefits in surrogate endpoints of disease suggest that RAAS suppression with olmesartan medoxomil may potentially have beneficial effects on CV outcomes in these patient populations."}

We therefore conducted the present multicentre, single-arm, prospective, observational study to investigate the 24-week efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. METHODS: Eligible patients (diastolic blood pressure [BP] 90-109 mmHg and systolic BP <180 mmHg off antihypertensive medication) were started on olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg once daily, with the possible up-titration to 40 mg once daily during 24 weeks of follow-up, to control clinic BP to the target level (<140/90 and <130/80 mmHg in diabetes mellitus). In a subset of enrolled patients, 24-h ambulatory and home BP monitoring were also performed. RESULTS: In the intent-to-treat analysis (n = 348), at 24 weeks of follow-up, the mean \u00b1 SD changes from baseline in clinic systolic/diastolic BP were 21.2 \u00b1 14.2/16.0 \u00b1 8.8 mmHg (p < 0.001). The proportions of patients who achieved the goal BP for systolic, diastolic and both were 81, 80 and 75 %, respectively. Olmesartan medoxomil also significantly (p < 0.001) reduced systolic/diastolic BP measured at patients' homes by 17.7 \u00b1 13.1/12.1 \u00b1 7.9 mmHg from baseline (n = 109), and reduced mean 24-h, daytime and night-time ambulatory BP by 13.3 \u00b1 16.3/7.6 \u00b1 9.5 mmHg, 13.9 \u00b1 17.4/8.0 \u00b1 10.4 mmHg and 12.3 \u00b1 18.1/6.8 \u00b1 10.2 mmHg, respectively (n = 87).

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "Hypertension is an increasingly prevalent cardiovascular risk factor associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Lowering blood pressure (BP) to recommended levels reduces the risk of hypertension-associated cardiovascular events. Despite current treatment options and recommendations, the BP of many patients remains suboptimally controlled. There is a need for more effective management in patients not achieving BP goals on current monotherapy or combination therapy. Regimens combining three or more antihypertensive agents have been shown to increase the proportion of patients achieving BP goals. Recent data suggest that the combination of olmesartan medoxomil, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide is a rational treatment option offering safe and effective BP reductions and goal attainment in a greater proportion of patients compared with dual-combination regimens. As the understanding of the importance of BP control grows, treatment options that enable patients to achieve BP goals quickly and safely will become increasingly important in hypertension management."}

After a 3- to 4-week placebo run-in period, eligible patients received once-daily OM (weeks 1-4, 20 mg; weeks 5-8, 40 mg), placebo plus OM (weeks 1-2, placebo; weeks 3-4, OM 20 mg; weeks 5-8, OM 40 mg), or LOS (weeks 1-4, 50 mg; weeks 5-8, 100 mg). A subset of patients underwent ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Efficacy endpoints by hypertension stage were mean change from baseline in seated cuff diastolic BP (SeDBP) at week 8 (primary); seated cuff systolic BP (SeSBP) at week 4 and week 8, and SeDBP at week 4 (secondary); and the change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory BP at week 8, and BP target achievement (tertiary). At week 8, patients with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension had least-squares mean SeDBP reductions from baseline of 9.9 and 9.5 mm Hg, respectively, for OM treatment, and 6.9 and 7.3 mm Hg for LOS treatment (P = 0.0095 and P = 0.0035, respectively). Overall, 63.6% of patients with stage 1 hypertension treated with OM versus 47.3% treated with LOS (P = 0.0095) achieved an SeBP of < 140/90 mm Hg, while 36.1% of patients with stage 2 hypertension treated with OM versus 25.2% treated with LOS (P = 0.0022) achieved an SeBP of < 140/90 mm Hg. At week 8, OM-treated patients with stage 2 hypertension had a significantly greater reduction in least-squares mean 24-hour ambulatory BP versus LOS-treated patients. Olmesartan and LOS were well tolerated, and the most common treatment-emergent adverse event was headache. Once-daily, maximum doses of OM in patients with stage 1 or stage 2 hypertension achieved superior BP reductions versus LOS, with similar tolerability."}

The trough-to-peak ratio (T/P ratio) and the smoothness index (SI) for systolic/diastolic BP were calculated using different methods according to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. RESULT: Olmesartan medoxomil 20-40 mg once daily reduced the systolic/diastolic ambulatory BP for 24-h, daytime, and night-time by 13.3 \u00b1 16.3/7.6 \u00b1 9.5, 13.9 \u00b1 17.4/8.0 \u00b1 10.4, and 12.3 \u00b1 18.1/6.8 \u00b1 10.2 mmHg in all eligible patients at week 24 from baseline (n = 87, P < 0.0001). The global and individual T/P ratios were 0.64/0.62 and 0.32/0.30 (n = 87) for systolic/diastolic BP, whereas these were 0.71/0.70 and 0.31/0.39 in fair responders (n = 71). Global and individual SI were 6.81/5.37 and 0.92/0.67 (n = 87) for systolic/diastolic BP, whereas these were 7.04/5.44 and 1.03/1.03 in fair responders (n = 71). Global and individual T/P ratios for systolic/diastolic BP were 0.75/0.82 and 0.45/0.46 in the 20 mg subgroup (n = 41), whereas these were 0.44/0.59 and 0.30/0.29 in the 40 mg subgroup (n = 30). Global and individual SI were 5.70/5.32 and 1.03/0.87 for systolic/diastolic BP in the 20 mg subgroup (n = 41), but these were 3.64/2.46 and 1.01/0.60 in the 40 mg subgroup (n = 30).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The method is based on the simultaneous equations for analysis of both the drugs using distilled water as a solvent. METO has absorbance maxima at 221 nm and OLME has absorbance maxima at 257 nm in distilled water. RESULTS: The linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 5-25 \u03bcg/ml and 4-20 \u03bcg/ml for METO and OLME, respectively. The concentrations of the drugs were determined by using the simultaneous equations method. The mean recovery was 100.90 \u00b1 1.76 and 100.26 \u00b1 0.71 for METO and OLME, respectively. CONCLUSION: The method was found to be simple, accurate, and precise and was applicable for the simultaneous determination of METO and OLME in the pharmaceutical tablet dosage form. The results of analysis have been validated statistically and by recovery studies."}

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "In at least 50% of patients with hypertension, particularly those with stage 2 hypertension, combination drug therapy is required to achieve the currently recommended blood pressure (BP) goals. It is likely that future hypertension guidelines will recommend lowering BP beyond the currently recommended systolic/diastolic BP goals of lower than 140/90 mmHg for all patients with hypertension and lower than 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. In a series of clinical trials, the combination of olmesartan medoxomil, a well-established angiotensin receptor blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, has produced greater reductions in systolic BP and diastolic BP and greater proportions of patients achieving BP goals than monotherapy with either component. Additionally, the increased efficacy resulting from the combination with hydrochlorothiazide does not appear to significantly affect the tolerability profile of olmesartan medoxomil. This article provides a comprehensive evaluation of the chemistry, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of this combination and discusses its role in the management of hypertension."}

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the change from baseline in mean seated systolic BP (SBP), proportions of patients achieving BP goal (<140/90\u2009mm\u2009Hg or <130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg in patients with diabetes), and the number and percentage of patients achieving a range of BP targets. Safety and tolerability of amlodipine 5 and 10\u2009mg, olmesartan medoxomil 10, 20 and 40\u2009mg, and all possible combinations of the two were also assessed. For each prespecified subgroup, all active treatments resulted in significant BP reductions from baseline (P<0.05). The antihypertensive effect of the combination of amlodipine+olmesartan medoxomil was generally greater than the constituent amlodipine or olmesartan medoxomil monotherapies, regardless of subgroup. In general, more patients receiving combination therapy achieved BP goal than those treated with monotherapies.

A combination antihypertensive therapy regimen may be required to reach recommended BP goals in older patients. OBJECTIVES: This study set out to report blood pressure (BP) data in elderly patients across the subgroups of stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension (prespecified subgroup) and isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) [post hoc]. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a subgroup analysis of a prospective, open-label study carried out in a multicenter, outpatient setting (e.g. the BeniSILVER [Benicar Efficacy: New Investigation Shows OM Treatment Increasingly Leads to Various Elderly Populations to Safe BP Reductions; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00412932] study). The study included 176 patients with a mean age of approximately 72 years; stage 1 hypertension, 60, stage 2 hypertension, 116, and ISH, 98. INTERVENTION: After a 2- to 3-week placebo run-in period, patients were uptitrated every 3 weeks from olmesartan medoxomil (OM) 20 mg daily to OM 40 mg, OM/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 40 mg/12.5 mg, and OM/HCTZ 40 mg/25 mg, if seated cuff BP (SeBP) was \u2265120/70 mmHg. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included change from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory BP and SeBP after 12 weeks of treatment, percentage of patients achieving a cumulative SeBP goal of <140/90 mmHg (stage 1 and stage 2 cohorts) or seated cuff systolic BP (SeSBP) goal of <140 mmHg (ISH cohort), and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Combination therapy was required by 159 patients. Changes from baseline in mean 24-hour ambulatory BP (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) were -24.2 (\u00b1 11.8)/-11.8 (\u00b1 6.9) mmHg, -26.5 (\u00b1 11.8)/-12.6 (\u00b1 6.7) mmHg, and -24.7 (\u00b1 12.5)/-11.2 (\u00b1 6.4) mmHg in the stage 1, stage 2, and ISH cohorts, respectively (all p < 0.001 vs baseline). Mean SeBP changes (\u00b1 SD) from baseline in patients titrated to OM/HCTZ 40 mg/25 mg were -24.6 (\u00b1 11.4)/-10.5 (\u00b1 7.3) mmHg in the stage 1 cohort, -26.4 (\u00b1 17.2)/-11.3 (\u00b1 9.7) mmHg in the stage 2 cohort, and -21.5 (\u00b1 15.6)/-6.8 (\u00b1 7.8) mmHg in the ISH cohort (all p < 0.001). The cumulative proportions of patients achieving an SeBP goal of <140/90 mmHg by week 12 were 88.3%, 56.0%, and 72.4% in the stage 1, stage 2, and ISH cohorts, respectively, while 72.4% of patients achieved an SeSBP of <140 mmHg in the ISH cohort. Treatment-emergent AEs ranged from 32.3% to 32.8%, with <3% of patients reporting drug-related hypotension. CONCLUSION: An OM/HCTZ-based titration regimen enabled elderly patients with hypertension to safely reduce BP throughout the 24-hour dosing interval and allowed the majority of these patients to achieve a BP target of <140/90 mmHg or <140 mmHg."}

However, in order to be useful, biomarkers must be relevant, predictable, accurate, and reproducible. There is compelling evidence from large-scale clinical trials that inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin type II receptor blockers (ARBs)] and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) may have beneficial effects beyond blood pressure control in the treatment of hypertension. Biomarkers are expected to provide further insight into these beneficial effects and allow for quantitative assessment. This review summarizes the published clinical evidence on the effects of various antihypertensive drugs, particularly ARBs (e.g. losartan and olmesartan medoxomil) and CCBs (e.g. amlodipine), alone and in combination with other agents (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide), on central aortic pressure and the biomarkers high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), adiponectin, cystatin C, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), procollagen, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-6. Of these biomarkers, the benefits of antihypertensive therapy on hsCRP, adiponectin, and HOMA-IR reflect a potential for quantifiable long-term vascular benefits."}

The SPIP study revealed that OLM is absorbed throughout whole intestinal regions, favoring proximal segments, at drug levels of 10-90 \u03bcM. The greatest value for effective permeability coefficient (P(eff)) was 11.4 \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s in the duodenum (90 \u03bcM); the lowest value was 2.9 \u00d7 10(-6) cm/s in the ileum (10 \u03bcM). A SMEDDS formulation consisting of Capryol 90, Labrasol, and Transcutol, which has a droplet size of 200 nm and self-dispersion time of 21 s, doubled upper intestinal permeability of OLM. The SMEDDS also improved oral bioavailability of OLM in vivo: a 2.7-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) with elevated maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and shortened peak time (T(max)) compared to an OLM suspension. A strong correlation (r(2) = 0.955) was also found between the in situ jejunal P(eff) and the in vivo AUC values. Our study illustrates that the SMEDDS formulation holds great potential as an alternative to increased oral absorption of OLM."}

A recent study has demonstrated that the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker lowers BNP concentrations. Here, we examined whether the ability of olmesartan medoxomil (OM; a novel angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker) to decrease plasma BNP levels is concentration dependent in hypertensive patients on HD. METHODS: This preliminary, observational, open-labeled prospective study included 24 patients on HD who were assigned to one group treated with OM (n = 14) or to an age-matched control group that was conventionally treated (n = 10). Blood pressure (BP) was monitored in the morning and evening of a non-HD day and before each HD session, and plasma BNP, plasma aldosterone (PAC), plasma active renin (PARC), and OM concentrations were measured at baseline, 4, and 8 weeks after treatment. RESULTS: Plasma BNP levels were significantly decreased in the OM group, but remained unchanged in the control group after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Compared with the control group, OM was associated with increased PARC and decreased PAC levels. The OM concentrations at 4 and 8 weeks significantly correlated with depressed plasma BNP levels in accordance with multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounders including BP. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OM can help to decrease plasma BNP levels via a concentration-dependent effect in patients on HD."}

We investigated whether treatment with ANG-II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan medoxomil is associated with the attenuation of cardiac myosin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through recently established new axis of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor. DCM was elicited in Lewis rats by immunisation with cardiac myosin, and 28 days after immunisation, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Myocardial protein and mRNA levels of ACE-2, ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the olmesartan-treated group compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. In contrast, Olmesartan treatment effectively suppressed the myocardial protein and mRNA expressions of inflammatory markers in comparison to the vehicle-treated DCM rats. Olmesartan treatment significantly reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy and their marker molecules (OPN, CTGF, ANP and GATA-4, respectively), as well as matrix metalloproteinases compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Enhanced myocardial protein levels of phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-JNK and phospho MAPKAPK-2 in the vehicle-treated DCM rats were prevented by olmesartan treatment. In addition, olmesartan treatment significantly lowered the protein expressions (Nitrotyrosine, p47phox and p67phox) and superoxide radical production compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Our present study might serve as a new therapeutic target of DCM in cardiovascular diseases and cardiac myosin-induced DCM via the modulation of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor axis in rats with DCM after myosin-immunisation."}

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of olmesartan medoxomil-induced angioedema in an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-na\u00efve patient. CASE SUMMARY: A 61-year-old white woman with hypertension experienced significant swelling of her face, neck, and lips 10 days after initiation of olmesartan medoxomil 20 mg/day. After discontinuation of the drug, symptoms resolved within 10 days. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable association between angioedema and olmesartan medoxomil. DISCUSSION: An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) is, in many cases, considered a safe alternative to an ACE inhibitor since serum bradykinin is thought not to be affected. However, angioedema has been reported with the use of ARBs, suggesting alternative pathways or mechanisms that result in this adverse reaction. Although not proven in humans, one explanation is that a secondary stimulation of angiotensin II AT2 receptors produces an increase in tissue bradykinin, resulting in angioedema. CONCLUSIONS: As of February 26, 2007, this is the first published reported case of olmesartan medoxomil-induced angioedema. Practitioners should be aware of this rare but potentially serious adverse event."}

The proposed assay was carried out in 96-microwell plates. The absorbance of the colored-CT complex was measured at 490 nm by microwell-plate absorbance reader. The optimum conditions of the reaction and the analytical procedures of the assay were established. Under the optimum conditions, linear relationship with good correlation coefficient was found between the absorbance and the concentration of OLM in the range of 1-200 \u03bcg ml-1. The limits of detection and quantitation were 0.3 and 1 \u03bcg ml-1, respectively. No interference was observed from the additives that are present in the pharmaceutical formulation or from hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine that are co-formulated with OLM in some formulations. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of OLM in tablets with good accuracy and precision. The assay described herein has great practical value in the routine analysis of OLM in quality control laboratories, as it has high throughput property, consumes minimum volume of organic solvent thus it offers the reduction in the exposures of the analysts to the toxic effects of organic solvents, and reduction in the analysis cost by 50-fold.

After a 2- to 3-week placebo run-in period, 207 patients received amlodipine 5 mg and were uptitrated to amlodipine/OM 5/20, 5/40, and 10/40 mg and then amlodipine/OM 10/40 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 and 25 mg in a step-wise manner at 3-week intervals if the seated blood pressure (BP) remained \u2265120/70 mm Hg. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP after 12 weeks of treatment. The baseline mean \u00b1 SD seated cuff systolic/diastolic BP was 158.8 \u00b1 13.1/89.1 \u00b1 10.1 mm Hg and the mean \u00b1 SD 24-hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic BP was 144.4 \u00b1 11.7/81.6 \u00b1 9.8 mm Hg. At week 12, the change from baseline in the mean \u00b1 SEM 24-hour ambulatory systolic/diastolic BP was -19.9 \u00b1 0.8/-11.2 \u00b1 0.5 mm Hg (p<0.0001 vs baseline), and 70% of patients had achieved a 24-hour ambulatory BP target of <130/80 mm Hg. At the end of 18 weeks of active treatment in patients uptitrated to amlodipine/OM 10/40 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, the change from baseline in the mean \u00b1 SEM seated BP was -28.0 \u00b1 1.5/-13.7 \u00b1 1.0 mm Hg (p<0.0001 vs baseline), with 62% of patients reaching the guideline-recommended seated BP goal of <130/80 mm Hg. Drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 19.3% of patients. The most frequent events were peripheral edema (6%), dizziness (3%), and hypotension (2%). In conclusion, this amlodipine/OM-based titration regimen was well tolerated and effectively lowered BP throughout the 24-hour dosing interval in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes."}

{"keyword": "olmesartan medoxomil", "texts": "Hypertension is a major health problem worldwide and remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Although public awareness and control of hypertension have improved over the last decade, only one-third of hypertensive patients achieve the rather conservative blood pressure (BP) goal of <140/90 mmHg. Most hypertensive patients require more than one drug for optimum BP control. Expert panels recommend use of combination therapy with two or more medications for Stage 2 and higher hypertension and in high-risk patients. However, the use of multiple drugs reduces patient compliance. Fixed-dose combination therapy helps improve patient compliance and thus achieve the target BP. Dose titration of the individual constituent drugs is recommended before switching to an equivalent fixed-dose combination. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that the fixed-dose combination of amlodipine-olmesartan medoxomil is more effective in lowering BP than monotherapy with either of these agents, with a similar side effect profile."}

{"keyword": "Alendronate Sodium", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:The purpose of this study was to develop lipid-water based drug delivery system of Alendronate Sodium (ALD) in liquid and solid form obtained by using spray drying method and compare these two forms with radioactive cell culture studies. METHODS:This study included the development of liquid and solid form obtained by spray drying method, radiolabelling of ALD with 99mTc, preparation of formulations containing 99mTc -ALD and evaluation of their permeability with Caco-2 cell. The liquid formulations have been developed by using various surfactants, co-surfactants, oil and water phases. Physicochemical characterizations like droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential measurements and short term stability studies were investigated. RESULTS:According to the measurement results, two oil in water formulations (F1-L and F2-L) were selected and spray dried with Buchi mini spray dryer apparatus to provide solid formulations (F1-S and F2-S). ALD was labeled with 99mTc and added to formulations. The effect of experimental conditions on radiolabeling efficiency of ALD and stability of all formulations containing 99mTc-ALD were investigated through Radio Thin Layer Chromatography (RTLC). It was observed that the labeling efficiency of ALD was greater than 90% and all formulations were found to be stable up to 6 h at room temperature. Permeability of radiolabeled ALD from all formulations was performed by using Caco-2 cells. According to the cell culture studies, permeability from spray dried formulations of ALD was found higher than liquid formulations. CONCLUSION:As a conclusion, spray dried formulations could be a promising drug delivery system for enhancing the permeability of ALD. Furthermore, this study is a good example of the use of radiolabeled compounds in drug development."}

Experiment (1) Investigated the effects of carvedilol (1.2\u2009mg/kg) and propranolol (4.0\u2009mg/kg) administered daily for 7\u2009days by gavage on paracetamol (1500\u2009mg/kg i.p.) -induced acute liver injury in rats.

Biochemical markers and histopathology of the livers were studied. Liver perfusion studies were carried out on CCl4 treated rats. Experiment (1) Carvedilol significantly improved the functional state of the liver in paracetamol-induced acute toxic hepatitis to a greater extent than propranolol. This was evidenced by a greater reduction in elevated serum levels of ALT and AST, hepatic MDA and TNF-\u03b1, attenuation of the paracetamol-induced decrease in GSH, together with improvement in the histological architecture of the liver. Experiment (2) Carvedilol was superior to propranolol against CCl4-induced hepatic injury and fibrogenesis. It suppressed hepatic inflammation, attenuated hepatic oxidative stress, and inhibited HSC activation. Carvedilol also decreased portal perfusion pressure. These results suggest that carvedilol might be a therapeutic anti-fibrogenic candidate against hepatic fibrosis, protecting the liver from acute and chronic toxic injury, in addition to lowering portal pressure."}

We performed a multicenter, randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of carvedilol plus GVO in secondary prophylaxis of GVB. METHODS:We performed a prospective study of 121 patients with cirrhosis (ages 20-80 years) with GVB proven by endoscopy within 24 hours of bleeding and stable hemodynamics for at least 3 days after initial GVO. Patients were randomly assigned into a group that underwent repeated GVO (n = 61) or a group received repeated GVO plus carvedilol (n = 60). Recurrent GVB, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), adverse events, and survival were compared between the groups. RESULTS:GVB recurred in 21 patients (34%) in the group that received repeated GVO and 14 patients (23%) in the group that received repeated GVO plus carvedilol (P = .18). Ascites (relative risk [RR], 2.69; 95% CI, 1.33-5.48; P = .006) and hepatoma (RR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.03-4.28; P = .04) were associated with recurrent GVB. Twenty-nine patients (48%) in the group that received repeated GVO and 17 patients (28%) in the group that received repeated GVO plus carvedilol had recurrent UGIB (P = .03). Carvedilol (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.24-0.80; P = .007) was associated with reduced risk of UGIB recurrence. Ascites (RR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.59-5.73; P = .001) and hepatoma (RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.10-3.88; P = .02) were associated with recurrent UGIB.

Mean survival times were 21 \u00b1 18 months in the group that received repeated GVO vs 25 \u00b1 20 months in the group that received repeated GVO plus carvedilol (P = .30). CONCLUSION:In a randomized controlled trial, we found that addition of carvedilol to GVO did not decrease recurrence of GVB in patients with cirrhosis but was associated with decreased recurrence of UGIB. However, carvedilol plus GVO produced significantly more adverse events. Mean survival times did not differ significantly between groups. ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT02504723."}

METHODS:The right upper molars of rats received 35% H2 O2 (1\u00d7 30\u00a0minutes), and the left upper molars were used as the control. Half of the rats received carvedilol gel (1\u00d7 10\u00a0minutes), forming the following groups: bleached, bleached followed by carvedilol (bleached+carvedilol), and control. After 2 and 30\u00a0days (N\u00a0=\u00a07 hemi-maxillae/group), the rats were killed for histological evaluation, and statistical tests were performed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

MAIN METHODS:The rats were divided into 4 groups (6 rats each): The first (negative control group). The second, third and fourth groups were fed with cholesterol and fat- enriched diet for one month that stopped and continued on the standard diet for another month without treatment in the second group but treated with carvedilol and nicorandil in the third and fourth group respectively. KEY FINDINGS:They revealed that both improved NAFLD especially nicorandil treated proved by the reduction of liver enzymes (AST, ALT), the fatty infiltration determined histologically and biochemically (decrease liver triglycerides). This may be due to either being antioxidants (reduced malondialdehyde and elevated reduced glutathione) or anti-inflammatory (decreased of TNF-\u03b1) together with the reduction of insulin resistance and adiponectin elevation or gene expression (increased liver NF-\u03baB and decreased eNOS expression) and finally maybe by their obvious effect on improvements of lipid parameters.

Carvedilol is promising for preventing anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC). This review appraised the preventive effects of carvedilol against AIC based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS:The Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Embase databases were searched from inception to March\u00a027, 2018. RCTs using carvedilol for the prevention of AIC were selected. Risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed. Meta-analysis was conducted, when applicable, for the trial endpoints; otherwise the data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS:Nine RCTs comprising 717 patients were selected. The risk of bias was unclear and the methodological quality differed substantially. Data pooling of five eligible studies indicated no decreased mortality in patients receiving carvedilol (risk difference\u202f=\u2009-0.02, 95% CI: -0.07-0.04, p\u202f=\u20090.57, I2\u202f=\u200944%). The impact on the incidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) was inconsistently reported but meta-analysis was not applicable due to discordant LVSD definitions. Data pooling of eight\u00a0studies and a\u00a0subgroup analysis indicated a\u00a0higher left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with substantial heterogeneity in the carvedilol group (mean difference [MD]\u202f=\u20095.23, 95% CI: 2.20-8.27, p\u202f=\u20090.0007, I2\u202f=\u200995%, and MD\u202f=\u20094.65, 95% CI: 0.67-8.64, p\u202f=\u20090.02, I2\u202f=\u200990%, respectively). Further analysis of echocardiographic parameters and biomarkers showed weak evidence of improvement in diastolic function and troponin\u00a0I level by carvedilol administration. CONCLUSION:Preventive use of carvedilol in patients undergoing anthracycline-based chemotherapy may be associated with a\u00a0reduced incidence of LVSD, higher LVEF value, better diastolic function, and lower troponin\u00a0I level. RCTs with larger sample size and longer follow-up are needed to verify these findings."}

Methods:Blood pressure, heart rate, echocardiographic parameters, and laboratory variables, were assessed pre and post treatment with carvedilol in 98 eligible patients. Results:Carvedilol at a median dose of 50\u2009mg/day during the treatment period in hypertensive heart disease lowered blood pressure 10/10\u2009mmHg, heart rate 10 beats/min, improved left ventricular ejection fraction from baseline to follow-up (median: 6\u2009years) (36%-47%)) and reduced left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions (62 vs 56\u2009mm; 53 vs 42\u2009mm, respectively, all p-values <0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction increased in 69% of patients. Patients who did not have improved left ventricular ejection fraction had nearly six-fold higher mortality than those that improved (relative risk; 5.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-25, p\u2009=\u20090.022).

Carvedilol was superior to metoprolol succinate in improving survival free of appropriate ICD therapy (HR 0.42; 95% CI 0.24-0.72, P = 0.01). This difference was driven by reduction in survival free of appropriate shocks (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15-0.63, P = -0.01) while there was no significant difference in appropriate ATP (HR 0.55; 95% CI 0.28-1.1, P = 0.12). There was no significant difference in time to inappropriate shocks (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.19-5.6, P = 0.97), inappropriate ATP (HR 0.93, OR 0.24-3.5, p value 0.9) or all cause death (HR 0.8; 95% CI 0.42-1.5, P = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS:This study suggests that carvedilol use was associated with improved survival free of appropriate ICD therapy compared to metoprolol succinate in patients with HFrEF."}

The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart Failure [PAHTCH] study showed safety and possible benefit of carvedilol in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated right heart failure over 6 months. This study aims at evaluating the short-term cardiovascular effects and early mechanistic biomarkers of carvedilol therapy. Methods: Thirty patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) received low dose carvedilol (3.125 mg twice daily) for 1 week prior to randomization to placebo, low-dose, or dose-escalating carvedilol therapy. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 1 week. Exercise capacity was assessed by 6 min walk distance (6MWD). The L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway and other biological markers of endothelial function were measured. Results: All participants tolerated 1 week of carvedilol without adverse effects. After 1 week of carvedilol, 6MWD and heart rate at peak exercise did not vary (both p > 0.1). Heart rate at rest and 1 min post walk dropped significantly (both p < 0.05) with a trend for increase in heart rate recovery (p = 0.08). Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) decreased by an average of 13 mmHg (p = 0.002). Patients who had a decrease in RVSP of more than 10 mm Hg were defined as responders (n = 17), and those with a lesser drop as non-responders (n = 13). Responders had a significant drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after 1 week of carvedilol (p = 0.004). In addition, responders had a greater decrease in heart rate at rest and 1 min post walk compared to non-responders (both p < 0.05). Responders had higher plasma arginine and global bioavailability of arginine at baseline compared to non-responders (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). After 1 week of carvedilol, responders had greater increase in urinary nitrate (p = 0.04). Responders treated with carvedilol had a sustained drop in RVSP and PVR after 6 months of carvedilol with no change in cardiac output. Conclusions: Low-dose carvedilol for 1 week can potentially identify a PH responder phenotype that may benefit from \u03b2-blockers that is associated with less endothelial dysfunction.

Several studies proposed improved hemodynamic effects of carvedilol compared with propanolol. Our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials comparing carvedilol with variceal banding ligation (VBL). Methods:Studies were searched on online databases MEDLINE, EMBASE(Ovid), the Cochrane Library, Chinese Wanfang Database, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure between January 2000 and May 2018. Incidence of bleeding and mortality were main outcome measures. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were conducted to ensure the robustness of pooled estimates. Results:Ten randomized control trials including 1,269 cirrhotic patients were chosen. Compared with VBL, carvedilol showed similar preventive efficacy of risk ratios (RRs) in variceal bleeding, and bleeding-related mortality over different follow-up periods from 6 months to 24 months. Also, significant differences between carvedilol and VBL in overall mortality and other causes of mortality were failed to be found. Carvedilol achieved a lower incidence of portal hypertension gastropathy in both 6 months (RR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.38-0.64, P<0.00001) and 12 months (RR=0.35, 95% CI: 0.26-0.47, P<0.00001). Two trials compared combination of carvedilol and VBL with VBL alone; however, the results failed to find an improved preventive efficacy of bleeding (RR=0.71, 95% CI: 0.15-3.30, P=0.67). Conclusion:Carvedilol is equivalent to invasive VBL for variceal bleeding prevention. It can be well tolerated and may be of benefit to portal hypertension gastropathy. However, available data during 24 months follow-up did not support a potential advantage of carvedilol for prognosis as a lowering hepatic venous pressure agent."}

However, a facile method to synthesize HMSNs has hardly been reported so far. The primary objective of our current study was to develop HMSNs using a simple, quick, and inexpensive method and evaluate their ability to enhance solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble model BSC type II drug Carvedilol. Traditional mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are synthesized using classical Stober method and HMSNs with an entire hollow core was induced by immersing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in hot water. Initial MSNs were added in boiling distilled water to synthesize hollow structure, to enhance pore size, and also to remove CTAB template. HMSNs prepared in our current study has exhibited high surface area (886.84\u2009m2/g), pore volume (0.79\u2009cm3/g), and uniform pore size (3.18\u2009nm), which also enabled the greater encapsulation of the model BSC II drug Carvedilol (CAR) inside the HMSNs. This technique also helped in achieving a high drug loading of (40.22\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73)%. Add to all this, in vitro studies conducted in the present work showed that compared with pure CAR and CAR loaded MSNs (CAR-MSNs) synthesized by Stober method, the drug-loaded HMSNs (CAR-HMSNs) exhibit sustained drug release performance. The high drug loading and sustained release can be attributed to the hollow porous structure of the HMSNs. Finally, a pharmacokinetic analysis in rats indicated a significant increase in bioavailability of carvedilol HMSNs in vivo compared to the pure carvedilol and carvedilol loaded MSNs. This study, therefore, offered a new, simple, and quick method to develop HMSNs with the ability to support higher loading and controlled release behavior in vitro and enhanced absorption of poorly-aqueous soluble drugs in-vivo."}
{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "BACKGROUND Carvedilol is the first-line drug for the primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding due to portal hypertension (PHT) in liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of carvedilol on intrahepatic angiogenesis and sinusoidal remodeling in cirrhotic rats and explore the underlying mechanisms of carvedilol in PHT. MATERIAL AND METHODS For in vivo experiments, carbon tetrachloride was used to induce liver cirrhosis in rats, and carvedilol was simultaneously administered by gavage. The portal pressure was measured in rats, and liver tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry. Sinusoidal remodeling was observed by transmission electron microscopy. For in vitro experiments, the effects of carvedilol on fibronectin (FN) synthesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were explored by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. RESULTS Portal vein pressure measurements showed that carvedilol reduced portal pressure in cirrhotic rats. Immunohistochemistry assays indicated that carvedilol ameliorated intrahepatic angiogenesis. Transmission electron microscopy examination demonstrated that carvedilol improved sinusoidal remodeling. In the in vitro experiments, carvedilol suppressed transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21)-induced FN synthesis in HUVECs by inhibition of the TGF\u03b21/Smads pathway. CONCLUSIONS Carvedilol ameliorated intrahepatic angiogenesis, sinusoidal remodeling and portal pressure in cirrhotic rats. Carvedilol improved sinusoidal remodeling by suppressing FN synthesis in endothelial cells. Carvedilol has potential utility for treating early-stage liver cirrhosis."}

{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by structural and functional changes in the myocardium. Several studies have revealed that myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis occur during DCM. Studies have also indicated that oxidative stress may be a major factor associated with the development of DCM. Protein kinase C (PKC)\u03b22 has been demonstrated to be activated in diabetic rats, and overexpression of PKC\u03b22 in the myocardium may result in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The P66shc adaptor protein, which is mediated by PKC\u03b2, serves an important role in apoptosis during oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the PKC\u03b22/P66shc oxidative stress pathway is associated with DCM, and to investigate the role and mechanisms of carvedilol in preserving cardiac function. Experimental diabetic rat models were induced by streptozotocin treatment accompanied by high energy intake. Carvedilol was orally administrated at a dose of 1 or 10 mg/kg/day. Cardiac function was evaluated by serum N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level and cardiac ultrasound. Myocardial inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and fibrosis were assessed by histopathological and echocardiographic analyses and tests for oxidative markers. Associated proteins and factors were examined by immunohistochemical and western blot analyses. Rats in the diabetes mellitus group exhibited significantly decreased systolic cardiac function along with elevated expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-PKC\u03b22, phos-P66shc, caspase-3, malondialdehyde, collagen type I, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2, which were accompanied by disorder in metabolic processes. Treatment with carvedilol reversed these changes. Thus, the present results suggest that the PKC\u03b22/P66shc signaling pathway may be associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy; furthermore, carvedilol, as a novel \u03b2-receptor blocker, may protect the myocardium from injury by suppressing the myocardial inflammatory response, fibrosis, P66shc-mediated oxidative stress and subsequent apoptosis in myocardial tissue. Consequently, carvedilol may have potential as a therapy for the treatment of DCM."}

{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "Carvedilol has been identified as a promising agent for the treatment of liver fibrosis. Meanwhile, autophagy and apoptosis have been reported to play key roles in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which can contribute to the progression of liver fibrosis. However, the effects of carvedilol on autophagy and apoptosis in HSCs remain unclear. Our study aimed to detect these effects and identify the underlying mechanisms by which carvedilol mediates HSC autophagy and apoptosis. For this purpose, the LX-2 cell line was used in this study, and the cells were exposed to various concentrations of carvedilol for specific times. First, we found that carvedilol increased autophagic marker levels, the number of GFP-LC3-containing puncta and LC3B-II levels in LX-2 cells. Interestingly, the addition of chloroquine (CQ) failed to enhance the effects on GFP-LC3 puncta and LC3B-II levels, and carvedilol treatment resulted in a significant increase in p62 protein levels. Moreover, carvedilol treatment led to the accumulation of yellow dots only in GFP-RFP-LC3-LX-2 cells, similar to the results following CQ treatment, indicating that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux. Next, we found evidence that carvedilol inhibited autophagic flux by increasing lysosomal pH and not by impairing the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Moreover, carvedilol substantially reduced the viability of LX-2 cells and noticeably induced cell apoptosis, as observed by flow cytometry. In addition, increased levels of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-8 and cleaved PARP, increased Bax activity and decreased Bcl-2 expression were detected in LX-2 cells. Finally, the carvedilol treatment inhibited autophagy and subsequently induced apoptosis in vitro. In conclusion, carvedilol suppresses autophagy and promotes apoptosis in HSCs and the late-stage inhibition of autophagy preceded the induction of apoptosis."}

Ethosomes composed of Phospholipon 100\u2009H, cholesterol, ethanol, and Transcutol P at different ratios, were prepared by thin-film hydration method with sonication. Carvedilol-loaded ethosomes were characterized by microscopic examinations followed by other in-vitro assessments. Selected ethosomal formulation (E10) was incorporated into different concentrations of gelling agents to prepare the ethogel formulations. Ethogels were subjected to physicochemical characterization, compatibility, and in-vitro drug release studies. Ex-vivo skin permeation and retention studies were performed followed by in-vivo studies in induced hypertensive rats. The smooth ethosomes demonstrated vesicular size of 201.55-398.55\u2009nm, entrapment efficiency of 30.00-90.66% and loading capacity of 7.64-43.04% with zeta potential range of -30.30 to -44.90\u2009mV. The homogeneous ethogels exhibited appropriate results of pH and drug content measurements. Spreadability was observed as a function of viscosity as the latter increased, the former decreased. The ethogel formulation (G2) manifested satisfactory physical appearance, spreadability, viscosity, and in-vitro release. In comparison to pure carvedilol gel, tested formulations (E10 and G2) developed high ex-vivo permeation, steady-state flux and drug retention through skin layers. The in-vivo study of G2 formulation revealed a significant gradual decline (p\u2009<\u20090.01) in the mean arterial pressure of rats at the second hour of experiment (146.11\u2009mmHg) with continuous significant decrease (p\u2009<\u20090.001) after 6\u2009h (98.88\u2009mmHg).

Carvedilol is a non-selective beta-blocker with additional intrinsic alpha1-blocking effects, which may be superior to traditional, non-selective beta-blockers in reducing portal pressure and, therefore, in reducing the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. OBJECTIVES:To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of carvedilol compared with traditional, non-selective beta-blockers for adults with cirrhosis and gastroesophageal varices. SEARCH METHODS:We combined searches in the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary's Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, and Science Citation Index with manual searches. The last search update was 08 May 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA:We included randomised clinical trials comparing carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, irrespective of publication status, blinding, or language. We included trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults with cirrhosis and verified gastroesophageal varices. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:Three review authors (AZ, RJ and LH), independently extracted data. The primary outcome measures were mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events. We undertook meta-analyses and presented results using risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and I2 values as a marker of heterogeneity. We assessed bias control using the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary domains and the quality of the evidence with GRADE. MAIN RESULTS:Eleven trials fulfilled our inclusion criteria. One trial did not report clinical outcomes. We included the remaining 10 randomised clinical trials, involving 810 participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices, in our analyses. The intervention comparisons were carvedilol versus propranolol (nine trials), or nadolol (one trial). Six trials were of short duration (mean 6 (range 1 to 12) weeks), while four were of longer duration (13.5 (6 to 30) months). Three trials evaluated primary prevention; three evaluated secondary prevention; while four evaluated both primary and secondary prevention. We classified all trials as at 'high risk of bias'. We gathered mortality data from seven trials involving 507 participants; no events occurred in four of these. Sixteen of 254 participants receiving carvedilol and 19 of 253 participants receiving propranolol or nadolol died (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.53; I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be no differences between carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers and the risks of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.37; 810 participants; 10 trials; I2 = 45%, very low-quality evidence) and serious adverse events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.42; 810 participants; 10 trials; I2 = 14%, low-quality evidence). Significantly more deaths, episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and serious adverse events occurred in the long-term trials but there was not enough information to determine whether there were differences between carvedilol and traditional, non-selective beta-blockers, by trial duration. There was also insufficient information to detect differences in the effects of these interventions in trials evaluating primary or secondary prevention. There appeared to be no differences in the risk of non-serious adverse events between carvedilol versus its comparators (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.29; 596 participants; 6 trials; I2 = 88%; very low-quality evidence). Use of carvedilol was associated with a greater reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient than traditional, non-selective beta-blockers both in absolute (MD -1.75 mmHg, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.89; 368 participants; 6 trials; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence) and percentage terms (MD -8.02%, 95% CI -11.49% to -4.55%; 368 participants; 6 trials; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). However, we did not observe a concomitant reduction in the number of participants who failed to achieve a sufficient haemodynamic response (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; 368 participants; 6 trials; I2 = 42%; very low-quality evidence) or in clinical outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:We found no clear beneficial or harmful effects of carvedilol versus traditional, non-selective beta-blockers on mortality, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, serious or non-serious adverse events despite the fact that carvedilol was more effective at reducing the hepatic venous pressure gradient. However, the evidence was of low or very low quality, and hence the findings are uncertain. Additional evidence is required from adequately powered, long-term, double-blind, randomised clinical trials, which evaluate both clinical and haemodynamic outcomes."}

We investigated if within the first 5 years of treatment patients with heart failure and obstructive airway diseases using non \u03b21-adrenoreceptor selective beta-blockers have an increased risk of being hospitalized for all-causes, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when compared to patient using selective beta-blockers. Methods: Carvedilol users were propensity matched 1:1 for co-treatments, age, gender, and year of inclusion in the cohort with metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to compare all causes, COPD, and heart failure hospitalization or the beta-blocker discontinuation between cohorts. For statistically significant associations, we computed the rate difference and the attributable risk. Results: Overall, 11,844 patients out of the 51,214 (23.1%) were exposed to carvedilol and 39,370 (76.9%) to metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard for heart failure hospitalization (HR 1.29; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.18-1.40) with 106 (95%CI 76-134; p-value < 0.001) additional cases of heart failure hospitalization per 10000 person-years if compared to metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. In all, 26.8% (95%CI 22.5-30.9%; p-value < 0.001) of heart failure hospitalizations in the study population could be attributed to being exposed to carvedilol. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard (HR 1.06; 95%CI 1.02-1.10) of discontinuing the pharmacological treatment with 131 (95%CI 62-201; p-value < 0.001) additional cases of beta-blocker discontinuation per 10000 person-years metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. In all, 6.5% (95%CI 3.9-9.0%; p-value < 0.001) of beta-blocker discontinuation could be attributed to being exposed to carvedilol.

However, the impact of miRNAs on the hepatoprotective effect of this non-selective \u03b2-blocker has not been yet elucidated. Hence, the current goal is to evaluate the potential role of circulating miR-200a in the hepatic anti-fibrotic pathway of Carvedilol. Male Wistar rats were randomized into normal, CCl4 (2\u2009ml/kg, i.p, twice weekly for 8 weeks), and CCl4\u2009+\u2009Carvedilol (10\u2009mg/kg, p.o, daily). Carvedilol over-expressed the circulating miR-200a to modulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (vimentin, E-Cadherin). In turn, Carvedilol increased SMAD7 gene expression and protein content to attenuate the pro-fibrogenic marker transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and the inflammatory markers (p-38 MAPK and p-S536-NF-\u03baB p65). The anti-fibrotic potential was reflected on the decreased expression of the mesenchymal product and EMT marker \u03b1-SMA, besides the improved histopathological examination, and the fibrosis scores/collagen quantification to enhance liver functions (AST, ALT, ALP, and AST/platelet ratio index; APRI).

{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:To evaluate, for the first time, the use of SCC4 cell monolayers as an alternative sublingual barrier model and study the influence of nanoencapsulation on carvedilol transport across SCC4 cell monolayers. SIGNIFICANCE:The sublingual cavity is an interesting route for administration of drugs with limited oral bioavailability due to hepatic first pass metabolism. By this route, the drug is directly absorbed into blood circulation. In this sense, mucoadhesive carvedilol-loaded nanocapsules (CAR-NC) were previously proposed for the administration of this drug by sublingual route. Carvedilol is used for cardiovascular diseases and suffers metabolism in liver when orally administrated. Nanoencapsulation of carvedilol controlled its permeation across porcine sublingual mucosa. METHODS:Carvedilol-loaded cationic nanocapsules were prepared by interfacial deposition of a preformed polymer. Drug permeation studies were carried out in Transwell\u00ae inserts. The integrity of cell monolayers after the drug transport was assessed by transepithelial electric resistance. Compatibility of the CAR-NC with the SCC4 cells was evaluated by the Sulforhodamine B assay. RESULTS:The drug permeated the cell monolayer by a controlled way when nanoencapsulated and this profile had a linear relation with those observed in porcine sublingual mucosa. The integrity of the cell monolayer was maintained after drug permeation and CAR-NC was no cytotoxic to SCC4 cells. CONCLUSION:Nanoencapsulated carvedilol permeated by a controlled and safe way by SCC4 cell monolayer. SCC4 cells monolayers may be used as in vitro model for sublingual drug transport studies in the development of novel formulations."}

The mechanism underlying this beneficial effect of carvedilol compared to other \u03b2-blockers is not clearly understood. In addition to \u03b2-blockers, inhibitors of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN)-gated channels, which play a critical role in spontaneous rhythmic activity in the heart, have also been proposed to be suitable drugs for reducing heart rate and, therefore, beneficial for treating CHF. In the present study, we investigated the effect of carvedilol on HCN channels.<label>EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH</label>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to assess the effect of carvedilol on currents from wild-type and mutant HCN1, HCN2 and HCN4 channels expressed in CHO cells.<label>KEY RESULTS</label>Carvedilol was the only \u03b2-blocker tested that showed inhibitory effects on the major sinoatrial HCN channel isoform HCN4.

Carvedilol blocked HCN channels by decelerating the rate of channel activation and increasing that of deactivation, and shifted the voltage-dependence of activation leftwards. Our data also showed that carvedilol, unlike other inhibitors of this channel (ivabradine and ZD7288), is not an 'open-channel' inhibitor of HCN4.<label>CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS</label>Carvedilol is a negative gating modulator of HCN channels.

Methods\u2004and\u2004Results: Rat cardiac myocytes were exposed to toxic doses of ouabain (50 \u00b5mol/L). Cell length (contraction) was monitored in electrically stimulated and non-stimulated conditions. Ouabain treatment increased contractility, frequency of spontaneous contractions and apoptosis compared to control cells. Carvedilol (1 \u00b5mol/L) or VK-II-86 (1 \u00b5mol/L) did not affect ouabain-induced inotropy, but significantly reduced the frequency of Ca2+ waves, spontaneous contractions and cell death evoked by ouabain treatment. This antiarrhythmic effect was not associated with a reduction in Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity, phospholamban and ryanodine receptor phosphorylation or SR Ca2+ load. Similar results could be replicated in human cardiomyocytes derived from stem cells and in a mathematical model of human myocytes. CONCLUSIONS:Carvedilol and VK-II-86 are effective to prevent ouabain-induced apoptosis and spontaneous contractions indicative of arrhythmogenic activity without affecting inotropy and demonstrated to be effective in human models, thus emerging as a therapeutic tool for the prevention of digitalis-induced arrhythmias and cardiac toxicity."}

Studies of mechanisms show that the redox-dependent decrease in \u03b21AR expression is uniquely prevented by carvedilol and not other \u03b2AR ligands.

However, because of their low melting points (40\u00b0C-60\u00b0C), SDs produced are usually soft and semisolid. The objective of present study was to prepare SDs of a Biopharmaceutical Classification System class II drug, carvedilol, in mixtures of stearoyl polyoxylglycerides (Acconon\u00ae C-50; m.p. \u223c50\u00b0C) with polymers by hot melt extrusion to obtain free-flowing powder upon grinding. Miscibility of carvedilol with Kollidon\u00ae VA64, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, and Klucel\u2122 EXF was first evaluated by film casting, and Kollidon\u00ae VA64 was selected for further study. SDs containing 5%-20% carvedilol, 0%-20% Acconon\u00ae C-50, and the remaining Kollidon\u00ae VA64 were prepared for hot melt extrusion. SDs were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and dissolution tests were conducted in 250 mL of pH 6.8 phosphate buffer by filling powders in capsules. Carvedilol was miscible with all polymers tested up to 50% and remained amorphous in SDs. The drug release from formulations containing 20% carvedilol and 0, 5%, 10%, and 20% Acconon\u00ae C-50 were 30%, 30%, 70%, and 90%, respectively, in 60\u00a0min.

The primary endpoint is a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome. Between August 2010 and May 2014, 801 patients were randomly assigned to the carvedilol group (N = 399) or the no beta-blocker group (N = 402) at 67 centers in Japan. The carvedilol dose was up-titrated from 3.4\u00b12.1 mg at baseline to 6.3\u00b14.3 mg at 1-year. During median follow-up of 3.9 years with 96.4% follow-up, the cumulative 3-year incidences of both the primary endpoint and any coronary revascularization were not significantly different between the carvedilol and no beta-blocker groups (6.8% and 7.9%, P = 0.20, and 20.3% and 17.7%, P = 0.65, respectively).

{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "Carvedilol is a non-selective \u03b2-adrenoreceptor antagonist and exhibits a wide range of biological activities. The voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel is one of the target ion channels of this compound. The rapidly activating Kv1.3 channel is expressed in several different tissues and plays an important role in the regulation of physiological functions, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, little is known about the possible action of carvedilol on Kv1.3 currents. Using the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, we have revealed that exposure to carvedilol produced a concentration-dependent blocking of Kv1.3 channels heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells, with an IC50 value of 9.7\u202f\u03bcM. This chemical decelerated the deactivation tail current of Kv1.3 currents, resulting in a tail crossover phenomenon. In addition, carvedilol generated a markedly hyperpolarizing shift (20\u202fmV) of the inactivation curve, but failed to affect the activation curve. Mutagenesis experiments of Kv1.3 channels identified G427 and H451, two related sites of TEA block, as important residues for carvedilol-mediated blocking. The present results suggest that carvedilol acts directly on Kv1.3 currents by inducing closed- and open-channel block and helps to elucidate the mechanisms of action of this compound on Kv channels."}

Carvedilol (CAR) is a \u03b2-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. Accordingly, supplementation with natural antioxidants or plant extracts exerts protective effects against various injury in vivo. Carnosic acid (CAA), the principal constituent of rosemary, has various biological activities, including antioxidant, antitumor, and anti-inflammatory. Here, heart injury mouse model was established using DOX (20 mg/kg) in vivo. And cardiac muscle cell line of H9C2 was subjected to 0.5\u202f\u03bcM of DOX for 24 h in vitro. Then, the protective effects of CAA and CAR alone, or the two in combination on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro were explored. The results indicated that both CAA and CAR, when used alone, were moderately effective in attenuating DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The combination of two drugs functioned synergistically to ameliorate cardiac injury caused by DOX, as evidenced by the significantly reduced collagen accumulation and improved dysfunction of heart. CAA and CAR exhibited stronger anti-oxidative role in DOX-treated mice partly by augmenting the expression and activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes. In addition, inflammatory response was significantly suppressed by the two in combination, proved by the decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines (COX2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18), which was associated with the inactivation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Furthermore, DOX-stirred apoptosis and autophagy were dramatically attenuated by the co-treatments of CAA and CAR through down-regulating cleaved Caspase-3 and LC3B signaling pathways. The effects of CAA and CAR combination against cardiotoxicity were observed in H9C2 cells with DOX stimulation. Our findings above suggested that the use of CAR and CAA in combination could be expected to have synergistic efficacy and significant potential against cardiotoxicity induced by DOX."}

The objective of this study was to assess the influence of CYP2D6 polymorphisms on the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics of carvedilol in healthy Korean volunteers. Methods:A PK/PD study for a single and multiple dosing of carvedilol were conducted. All volunteers in 3 genotypic groups received single oral dose of carvedilol 12.5 mg for 3 days, then 25 mg QD for 5 days, and 12.5 mg QD for another 3 days. PK parameters for carvedilol and its three metabolites were determined using non-compartmental analysis. For PD properties, blood pressure, heart rate, and the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25) value were obtained. Results:The IM_2 group with two *10 alleles (intermediate metabolizers) exhibited lower clearance of carvedilol as well as higher area under the curve (AUC) for O-desmethyl carvedilol. The ratio of CD25 to baseline at multiple dosing was significantly higher in the combined IM group (IM_1 and IM_2) than in the EM group, however, the ratio of CD25 after single and multiple dosing and the other PD markers were not significantly different between the 3 genotypic groups compared with the baseline. Conclusion:These findings showed that CYP2D6 genotype influenced the PK characteristics of carvedilol and no differences in PD response were observed in Korean healthy volunteers.

There is a paucity of evidence on interventions that might provide cardio-protection. We investigated whether prophylactic use of carvedilol can prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and whether any observed effect is dose related. METHODS:A prospective, randomized, double-blind study in patients treated with doxorubicin, comparing placebo (n\u202f=\u202f38) with different doses of carvedilol [6.25\u202fmg/day (n\u202f=\u202f41), 12.5\u202fmg/day (n\u202f=\u202f38) or 25\u202fmg/day (n\u202f=\u202f37)]. The primary endpoint was the measured change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from baseline to 6 months. RESULTS:LVEF decreased from 62\u202f\u00b1\u202f5% at baseline to 58\u202f\u00b1\u202f7% at 6-months (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) in patients assigned to placebo but no statistically significant changes were observed in any of the 3 carvedilol groups.

No significant differences were noted between carvedilol and placebo in terms of the development of diastolic dysfunction, clinically overt heart failure or death. CONCLUSIONS:Carvedilol might prevent deterioration in LVEF in cancer patients treated with doxorubicin. This effect may not be dose related within the studied range."}

Carvedilol is one of a few \u03b2-blockers identified as biased agonist based on an ability to promote \u03b2-arrestin-mediated processes such as ERK phosphorylation. To understand the role of phosphoproteomic signaling in carvedilol's anticancer activity, the mouse epidermal JB6 P+ cells treated with EGF, carvedilol, or their combination were analyzed using the Phospho Explorer Antibody Array containing 1318 site-specific and phospho-specific antibodies of over 30 signaling pathways. The array data indicated that both EGF and carvedilol increased phosphorylation of ERK's cytosolic target P70S6\u2009K while its nuclear target ELK-1 were activated only by EGF; Furthermore, EGF-induced phosphorylation of ELK-1 and c-Jun was attenuated by carvedilol. Subcellular fractionation analysis indicated that ERK nuclear translocation induced by EGF was blocked by co-treatment with carvedilol. Western blot and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the biased \u03b2-blockers carvedilol and alprenolol blocked EGF-induced phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun/AP-1 and ELK-1. Consistently, both carvedilol and alprenolol strongly prevented EGF-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells. Remarkably, oral carvedilol treatment significantly inhibited the growth of A375 melanoma xenograft in SCID mice. As nuclear translocation of ERK is a key step in carcinogenesis, inhibition of this event is proposed as a novel anticancer mechanism for biased \u03b2-blockers such as carvedilol."}

OBJECTIVES Evaluate the role of Cv on the inflammatory response of C57BL/6 mice acutely infected with the Colombian strain of T. cruzi. METHODS Animals were infected with the Colombian strain of T. cruzi and treated with Cv (25 mg/kg/day), benznidazole (Bz) (100 mg/kg/day) or their combination. On the 28th day of infection and 23 days of treatment, the euthanasia occurred, and the heart preserved for histopathological, oxidative stress (SOD, catalase, TBARs, carbonylated proteins) and plasma (CCL2, CCL5, TNF, IL-10) analyses. Parasitaemia and survival were assessed along the infection. FINDINGS Cv decreased TBARs, but increased the mortality rate, the parasitaemia and the levels of CCL2, CCL5, catalase and the inflammatory infiltrate in the cardiac tissue. Bz led the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate and circulating levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators in the infected mice.

Here, we introduced a new concept of using amphiphilic polymers as fundamental excipients in electrospun nanofibers, which would improve drug solubilization and accelerate its release. Hydrophilic poloxamer-based nanofibers were developed as a novel drug delivery system for carvedilol. These nanofibers were electrospun from different liquid carvedilol dispersions, as carvedilol (nano)suspensions or ethanol solution. The electrospun products showed similar morphologies, but different mean fiber diameters (170-450\u202fnm). Carvedilol dissolution rates from nanofibers were faster compared to its dissolution from polymer films. The electrospinning from ethanol solution resulted in the highest dissolution rate, since >90% of the drug was dissolved in the first 5\u202fmin. The type of liquid medium significantly affects also the drug crystallinity. Thus, nanofibers produced from ethanol polymer solution showed no detectable crystalline carvedilol, whereas crystalline carvedilol form II or III was detected in the other nanofiber samples investigated. In a prolonged stability study (to 1\u202fyear), the potential of nanofibers to preserve the active ingredient in the initial non-crystalline form was demonstrated. Poloxamer-based nanofibers thus represent a promising formulation for immediate release and improved dissolution rates of poorly soluble drugs."}

METHODS/DESIGN:Patients with stable HFrEF will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the carvedilol-SR group (160 patients) and the carvedilol-IR group (160 patients). Patients aged\u2009\u2265\u200920\u00a0years, with a left ventricular ejection fraction\u2009\u2264\u200940%, N-terminal pro B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)\u2009\u2265\u2009125\u00a0pg/ml or BNP\u2009\u2265\u200935\u00a0pg/ml, who are clinically stable and have no evidence of congestion or volume retention, will be eligible. After randomization, patients will be followed up for 6\u00a0months. The primary endpoint is the change in NT-proBNP level from baseline to the study end. The secondary endpoints include the proportion of patients with NT-proBNP increment\u2009>\u200910% from baseline, composite of all-cause mortality and readmission, mortality rate, readmission rate, changes in blood pressure, quality of life, and drug compliance. DISCUSSIONS:The SLOW-HF trial is a prospective, randomized, open-label, phase-IV, multicenter study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of carvedilol-SR compared to carvedilol-IR in HFrEF patients. If carvedilol-SR proves to be non-inferior to carvedilol-IR, a once-daily prescription of carvedilol may be recommended for patients with HFrEF.

On day 17/15 (DOX/5-FU), blood samples were collected, and liver and kidneys of rats were harvested for antioxidant and histopathological assessments. Carvedilol alone and coadministered with prednisolone significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) decreased alanine aminotransferase level compared with administration of DOX alone. Carvedilol alone and coadministered with diltiazem significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) decreased creatinine level compared with administration of DOX/5-FU alone. Carvedilol alone and coadministered with diltiazem and prednisolone significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) increased the level of hepatic superoxide dismutase and catalase, and decreased malondialdehyde compared with DOX administration alone. Histopathological observations correlated with results of biochemical and antioxidant analyses. Carvedilol administered alone and coadministered with diltiazem and prednisolone reduced the effect of DOX/5-FU-induced hepatic and renal toxicities due to enhanced in\u00a0vivo antioxidant activity. The protective effect was more prominent in the doxorubicin model compared with the 5-fluorouracil test. Coadministration of carvedilol with either diltiazem or prednisolone did not show better protection relative to carvedilol alone."}

Recently, we found that Carvedilol, as the classic anti-heart failure and anti-inflammatory clinic drug, could inhibit the TLR4 signaling in the TLR4 overexpressed cells. Herein, we have designed and synthesized a small library of novel Carvedilol derivatives and investigated their potential inhibitory activity. The results indicate that the most potent compound 8a (SMU-XY3) could effectively inhibited TLR4 protein and the LPS triggered alkaline phosphatase signaling in HEK-Blue hTLR4 cells. It down regulated the nitric oxide (NO) in both RAW264.7\u202fcells and BV-2 microglial cells, in addition to blocking the TNF-\u03b1 signaling in ex-vivo human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). More interestingly, 8a shows higher affinity to hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 4 (HCN4) over HCN2, which probably indicates the new application of TLR4 inhibitor 8a in heart failure, coronary heart disease, and other inflammatory diseases."}

The present study aimed to develop a novel amorphous solid dispersion (ASD) of CAR with acidic counter ions for pH modifications in microenvironment to improve the pharmacokinetic properties under hypochlorhydric conditions. CAR-ASD was prepared by freeze-drying in combination with counter ions and hydroxypropyl cellulose, and their physicochemical properties including dissolution behavior, storage stability, and photostability were characterized. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out after oral administration of CAR samples in both normal and omeprazole-treated (30\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) rats as a hypochlorhydria model. Among the tested six counter ions, citric acid (CA) was found to be a preferable pH-modifier of CAR with respect to the dissolution profile and photostability (both potency and colorimetric evaluation). In CAR-ASD formulation with 50% loading of CA (CAR-ASD/CA50), amorphization of CAR was observed during the preparation process. After the oral administration of crystalline CAR in rats under hypochlorhydric condition, there was a 34.4% reduction in the systemic exposure of CAR compared with that in normal rats. However, orally-dosed CAR-ASD/CA50 resulted in limited alterations of pharmacokinetic behavior between normal and omeprazole-treated rats. From these findings, addition of CA as pH-modifier in CAR-ASD might provide consistent pharmacokinetic behavior of CAR even under hypochlorhydric conditions."}

Prevention with \u03b2-blockers remains controversial.This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study sought to evaluate the role of carvedilol in preventing ANT cardiotoxicity.The authors randomized 200 patients with HER2-negative breast cancer tumor status and normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) referred for ANT (240\u00a0mg/m2) to receive carvedilol or placebo until chemotherapy completion. The primary endpoint was prevention of a\u00a0\u226510% reduction in LVEF at 6\u00a0months. Secondary outcomes were effects of carvedilol on troponin I, B-type natriuretic peptide, and diastolic dysfunction.Primary endpoint occurred in 14 patients (14.5%) in the carvedilol group and 13 patients (13.5%) in the placebo group (p\u00a0=\u00a01.0).

Use of beta-blocker, type and dose was acquired through the Danish Prescription Registry. According to guideline recommendations, we defined target daily doses as\u2009\u226550\u2009mg carvedilol and\u2009\u2265200\u2009mg metoprolol. Prior to implantation 2427 of 2935 (83%) patients received beta-blocker therapy, with 2166 patients (89%) having initiated treatment 3 months or more prior to implantation. The majority of patients was prescribed carvedilol (52%) or metoprolol (41%). Patients on carvedilol reached target dosages more frequently than patients on metoprolol, with 39% of patients on carvedilol and 26% of patients on metoprolol at the time of implantation (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for all time-points).

Carvedilol treatment was a strong predictor for being on target dose of BB at time of implant, as was treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or spironolactone, no history of myocardial infarction, younger age and less pronounced heart failure symptoms. Conclusion:In a real-life setting of primary prevention ICD patients, 39% and 26% of patients were titrated to optimal target dose of carvedilol or metoprolol prior to implantation. A higher proportion of patients on carvedilol reached target dose, as compared with metoprolol."}

{"keyword": "Carvedilol", "texts": "Background:Carvedilol is used in the management of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, heart failure and most recently, portal hypertension. It has been associated with improved outcomes regarding variceal bleeding, hepatic decompensation and death when compared to propranolol and endoscopic band ligation. The main cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis and therefore carvedilol is increasingly used in these patients. Due to its extensive hepatic metabolism, carvedilol is contraindicated in severe hepatic impairment. However, there are no dosage adjustments in the manufacturer's labelling for mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Case presentation:We present a case of cardiogenic shock that occurred after carvedilol 25\u00a0mg orally was administered to a patient with cirrhosis. As there was no overdose, the diagnosis was based on clinical recognition of the toxidrome. The patient was successfully treated with glucagon 5\u00a0mg bolus followed by infusion. Conclusions:Patients with cirrhosis represent a special at-risk group for beta blocker toxicity. The typical threshold for carvedilol toxicity in overdose is 50\u00a0mg but in patients with cirrhosis this is not applicable. Nurses and physicians need to recognize the toxidrome early. Hospitals where carvedilol is used in patients with cirrhosis should have glucagon in formulary at doses to treat toxicity (bolus and infusion). Finally, dose adjustment and slow uptitration of carvedilol in cirrhosis is recommended."}

The selected SEDDS formulation (S1) was adsorbed onto solid powder excipients and compressed into tablets. The resulting liquisolid tablets were evaluated under British Pharmacopoeia (B.P.) specifications. Pre- and post-compression studies were performed to determine the flow properties and evaluate the liquisolid systems, followed by in vivo studies in hypertensive rats.Attempts of self-emulsification, droplet size, and thermodynamic stability studies showed acceptable results for the S1 formulation containing Capryol 90, Tween 20, and Transcutol HP (10:53.3:26.2%), respectively. Pre-compression studies showed adequate flowability and compatibility of liquid and solid excipients with Carvedilol. The selected liquisolid tablet (LS7) demonstrated the best disintegration and water absorption ratio in addition to satisfactory friability and hardness. A significantly (p\u2009<\u2009.05) fast dissolution rate was observed for both SEDDS and liquisolid formulations when compared to pure drug and marketed Carvepress\u00ae.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of carvedilol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, on responses to endogenous vasoconstrictors which play a role in graft spasm and the possible interaction between carvedilol and diltiazem/papaverine which are vasodilators commonly used in CABG surgery.Isolated LIMA rings collected from patients undergoing CABG operation were suspended in an organ bath. Concentration-dependent responses to norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT) and diltiazem were examined before and after carvedilol incubation (10-6 M, 1 hour). Maximum relaxation response to papaverine (10-4 M) was compared in LIMA rings incubated with 0.05% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, placebo) or carvedilol (10-6 M).Carvedilol did not affect the maximal contractile response to NE; however, it significantly reduced the sensitivity of LIMA to NE. Carvedilol increased contractile response and sensitivity to 5-HT. Promisingly, carvedilol increased the vasodilatory effects of diltiazem and papaverine.Our study suggests that carvedilol may be administered perioperatively in combination with diltiazem or papaverine to prevent or resolve LIMA graft spasm."}

METHODS:A systematic review was performed on electronic databases, including relevant studies that analysed beta-blockers as cardioprotective agents before the use of anthracyclines by adult oncologic patients. RESULTS:After application of eligibility and selection criteria, eight articles were considered as high quality, complying with the proposed theme; all eight clinical trials, four of them placebo-controlled, with a total number of 655 patients included. From this sample, 281 (42.9%) used beta-blocker as intervention, and carvedilol was the most frequent (167 patients - 25.5%). Six studies were considered positive regarding the cardioprotection role played by beta-blockers, although only four demonstrated significant difference on left ventricle ejection fraction after chemotherapy on groups that used beta-blockers compared to control groups. Carvedilol and nebivolol, but not metoprolol, had positive results regarding cardioprotection. Other beta-blockers were not analysed in the selected studies. CONCLUSIONS:Despite the potential cardioprotective effect of beta-blockers, as demonstrated in small and unicentric clinical trials, its routine use on prevention of anthracycline-associated cardiotoxicity demands greater scientific evidence."}

The present study was designed to elucidate the potential role of antifibrotic effects of carvedilol in improving hepatic efficiency and the carvedilol oral pharmacokinetic changes during induction of liver fibrosis.Rats were given CCl4 (1\u00a0ml/kg, intraperitoneal) twice weekly for 6\u00a0weeks and/or co-treated with carvedilol (10\u00a0mg/kg, orally) three times weekly on alternating days. Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test was used as a modality for the measurement of hepatic blood flow. In addition, assessment of serum albumin as a marker of synthetic capacity and immunohistochemical staining of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression as a marker of metabolic capacity were done. Furthermore, hydroxyproline and TGF-\u03b21 were detected as markers of liver fibrosis.The area under plasma concentration-time curve of a single dose of carvedilol was significantly increased, associated with decreased the clearance in rats intoxicated with CCl4 compared to control group. Carvedilol co-treatment in CCl4-intoxicated rats for 6\u00a0weeks significantly counteracted the changes in hepatotoxicity markers and histopathological lesions induced by CCl4. In addition, there were no significant alterations in carvedilol pharmacokinetics between control and CCl4-intoxicated rats. Furthermore, carvedilol treatment restored liver efficiency, including synthetic and metabolic capacity as well as hepatic blood flow.The present study provides evidence underlying the antifibrotic effects of carvedilol and enhancement of hepatic efficiency. In addition, the pharmacokinetic parameters of a single dose of carvedilol are altered in liver fibrosis, manifested as delayed clearance. This was attributed to the reduction of both hepatic blood flow and CYP2D6 expression in the liver. Carvedilol co-treatment in CCl4-intoxicated rats for 6\u00a0weeks recovered its pharmacokinetic profile, which is mainly attributed to the impact of pharmacodynamic antifibrotic effects of carvedilol on its own kinetics."}

We compared cardiac cycle mechanics and interventricular interactions in 15 sham, 8 monocrotaline-PAH, 9 PAH + carvedilol, and 8 PAH + ivabradine rats. We used echocardiography to assess biventricular function, timing of cardiac cycle events, and septal position in PAH rats and related HR reduction effects on biventricular function measured by echocardiography and conductance catheter. HR was 302 beats/min in PAH + carvedilol rats and 303 beats/min in PAH + ivabradine rats versus 359 beats/min in PAH rats ( P < 0.01). Sham rats showed temporal alignment between right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) events, whereas PAH rats showed increased biventricular isovolumic contraction times (ICTs), delayed RV peak radial motion, and impaired early relaxation. Temporal malalignment was associated with decreased tricuspid and mitral diastolic annular peak velocities (3.7 vs. 6.4 and 3.4 vs. 5.3 cm/s, respectively, P < 0.001), delayed and shortened biventricular filling, and reduced early diastolic LV filling velocity (0.56 vs. 0.81 cm/s, P < 0.01). LV eccentricity index was increased at systole (2.0 vs. 1.2, P < 0.001), early diastole (2.1 vs. 1.1, P < 0.001), and end diastole (1.6 vs. 1.1, P < 0.001) in PAH versus sham rats. HR reduction with carvedilol and ivabradine shortened biventricular ICTs and the time to biventricular peak radial motion, improved RV relaxation, and increased early diastolic LV filling through reduced interventricular interaction and improved timing. These improvements corresponded with enhanced hemodynamics (increased cardiac output, RV contractility, and diastolic relaxation). In conclusion, HR reduction by carvedilol and ivabradine improves biventricular filling and hemodynamics in experimental PAH through realignment of RV-LV cardiac cycle events and improved interventricular interactions. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Carvedilol improves biventricular function in experimental pulmonary arterial hypertension, but the mechanisms of heart rate reduction versus \u03b2-blocker effect are inadequately defined. Here, we demonstrate that reducing heart rate using either carvedilol or ivabradine (hyperpolarization-activated current inhibitor without \u03b2-blocker effect) improves right ventricular filling and biventricular hemodynamics through the realignment of right ventricular-left ventricular cardiac cycle events and improved interventricular interactions."}

The CAR group was treated with gavage using 12.5 mg/kg carvedilol, once a day for 14 consecutive days, while the Sham group and BDL group were treated with gavage using the equivalent normal saline. After that, the mice in Sham group received the laparotomy under chloral hydrate anesthesia, followed by direct abdominal closure. The mice in BDL group and CAR group received the common bile duct ligation after anesthesia for modeling. After modeling, the survival rate of mice in each group was detected, and the blood and liver tissues were taken for detection. The morphological changes in liver tissues and apoptosis in mice in each group were detected and compared. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline, and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) were also detected. The mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory factors, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1-SMA and collagen-1 were detected via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression levels of CHOP (CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), ATF6, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), \u03b1-SMA, and collagen-1, were detected via Western-blotting.Our study showed that carvedilol could significantly alleviate the biliary cirrhosis in mice, and improve the survival rate of mice. The ALT, AST and TBIL levels, severity of cirrhosis, and number of apoptotic cells in CAR group were significantly lower than those in BDL group. The levels of \u03b1-SMA and hydroxyproline in CAR group were also significantly lower than those in BDL group. The activity of SOD in CAR group was significantly higher than that in BDL group; the above differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). In addition, it was also found that carvedilol could down-regulate the mRNA expression levels of iNOS, COX-2 and TGF-\u03b21, down-regulate the mRNA and protein expression levels of \u03b1-SMA and collagen-1, and negatively regulate the ATF4-CHOP, ATF6-CHOP and IRE1-pJNK signaling pathways.Carvedilol has a significant effect on alleviating the biliary cirrhosis in mice, and its relevant mechanism may be that carvedilol inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum stress through the negative regulation of ATF4-CHOP, ATF6-CHOP and IRE1-pJNK signaling pathways, which needs to be confirmed by further in vitro experiments."}

METHODS AND RESULTS:Cox and logistic regression were used for both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Carvedilol users had a higher hazard of being hospitalized for HF compared with metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users in both the unadjusted [hazard ratio (HR) 1.74; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-1.83] and adjusted (HR 1.61; 95% CI 1.52-1.70) analyses. No significant differences were found for all-cause and COPD hospitalization between the two groups. Carvedilol users had a significant lower restricted mean persistence time than metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users. Patients exposed to carvedilol had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.38 (95% CI 1.23-1.56) for being hospitalized due to COPD within 60\u2009days after redeeming the first carvedilol prescription, which was similar to that observed in metoprolol/bisoprolol/nebivolol users (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.27-1.48).

Carvedilol is a rising nonselective beta-blocker used for reducing portal pressure with favorable outcome. The aim of this study to assess the efficacy of carvedilol, propranolol, and band ligation for primary prevention of variceal bleeding based on the effect of each regimen on progression of Child score and portal hypertensive gastropathy after 1\u00a0year. METHODS:The study included 264 cirrhotic patients with medium/large-sized varices who were candidates for primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: group\u00a0I: band ligation; group\u00a0II: propranolol; group\u00a0III: carvedilol. RESULTS:Group\u00a0I showed higher success rate of 75\u00a0%, followed by group\u00a0III with 70.2\u00a0% and group\u00a0II with 65.2\u00a0%. Risk of bleeding was comparable between the three groups, with group\u00a0II carrying the highest rate of complications (34.7\u00a0%) followed by group\u00a0III (14.2\u00a0%) and finally group\u00a0I (5.7\u00a0%). After 1\u00a0year of follow-up, Child score did not improve in any of the studied groups, while portal hypertensive gastropathy significantly increased in group\u00a0I but decreased in groups\u00a0II and III. CONCLUSIONS:Band ligation is the best treatment option for primary prevention of variceal bleeding with minimal complications. Carvedilol is a good pharmaceutical alternative medicine to propranolol with lesser side-effects. Progress of liver disease as represented by Child score is not affected by any of the primary variceal prophylactic regimens, although medical treatment reduces portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Carvedilol, an antihypertensive drug, was chosen and formulated using solvent-based electrospinning to overcome the poor water solubility of the drug. Vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (PVPVA64) and Soluplus were used to create two different amorphous solid dispersions of the API. The load-dependent effect of the additives on dissolution and permeation through regenerated cellulose membrane was observed by a side-by-side diffusion cell, \u03bcFLUX. The solubilizing effect of the polymers was studied by carrying out thermodynamic solubility assays. The supersaturation ratio (SSR, defined as the ratio of dissolved amount of the drug to its thermodynamic solubility measured in exactly the same medium) was found to be the driving force of membrane transport in the case of size-exclusion membranes. Although the transport through lipophilic and size-exclusion membranes is mechanistically different, in both cases, the driving force of membrane transport in the presence of polymer additives was found to be the same. This finding may enable the use of size-exclusion membranes as an alternative to lipid membranes in formulation development of amorphous solid dispersions."}

Other beta-blockers including metoprolol and atenolol showed no association with hearing loss. Linear multiple regression analysis was run including variables of gender, age, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure/dilated cardiomyopathy, frusemide and carvedilol use as predictors for total hearing loss severity at all frequencies. Age and gender, as well as carvedilol, were found to be the only statistically significant predictors for hearing loss severity.Chronic use of carvedilol was associated with significant hearing loss. This may need to be taken into account when prescribing the drug. Further randomised controlled studies with baseline audiometric hearing tests before starting treatment, and periodic follow-up tests, would provide a better assessment of the effect of carvedilol on hearing."}

Similar to left heart failure, sympathetic overactivation and \u03b2-adrenoreceptor (\u03b2AR) abnormalities are found in PAH. Based on successful therapy of left heart failure with \u03b2-blockade, the safety and benefits of the nonselective \u03b2-blocker/vasodilator carvedilol were evaluated in PAH. METHODS:PAH Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart Failure (PAHTCH) is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. Following 1-week run-in, 30 participants were randomized to 1 of 3 arms for 24 weeks: placebo, low-fixed-dose, or dose-escalating carvedilol. Outcomes included clinical measures and mechanistic biomarkers. RESULTS:Decreases in heart rate and blood pressure with carvedilol were well tolerated; heart rate correlated with carvedilol dose. Carvedilol-treated groups had no decrease in exercise capacity measured by 6-minute walk, but had lower heart rates at peak and after exercise, and faster heart rate recovery. Dose-escalating carvedilol was associated with reduction in right ventricular (RV) glycolytic rate and increase in \u03b2AR levels. There was no evidence of RV functional deterioration; rather, cardiac output was maintained. CONCLUSIONS:Carvedilol is likely safe in PAH over 6 months of therapy and has clinical and mechanistic benefits associated with improved outcomes. The data provide support for longer and larger studies to establish guidelines for use of \u03b2-blockers in PAH. TRIAL REGISTRATION:ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01586156FUNDING.

(2) Model group: rats were injected with 5 mg/(kg\u00b7d) ISO for 10 days, followed by 10 mL/(kg\u00b7d) of saline by gavage for 4 weeks. (3) Treatment group: rats were injected with 5 mg/(kg\u00b7d) ISO for 10 days, followed by 10 mg/(kg\u00b7d) carvedilol by gavage for 4 weeks. Following treatments, the Cardiac Weight Index (CWI) was measured. The pathological changes to myocardial tissue were observed by HE staining and Masson's trichrome staining. The mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21 was determined by RT-PCR. The protein expression of TGF-\u03b21 was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The concentration of serum BNP was measured by ELISA.According to our results, no significant pathological changes were observed in myocardial tissue of the control group. The denaturation, hypertrophy, edema and necrosis of myocardial cells as well as increased collagen fibers in myocardial tissue of the model group, were more pronounced compared to the treatment group. The CWI, level of TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissue, and the concentration of serum BNP of the model group, were significantly higher than that of the treatment group, and those of the treatment group were significantly higher than in the control group. There were significant differences among the three groups. There were also significant differences between any two groups.The expression of TGF-\u03b21 in myocardial tissue was upregulated and the concentration of serum BNP was increased in myocardial remodeling of SD rats induced by ISO. Carvedilol intervention can downregulate the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and decrease the concentration of BNP, inhibiting myocardial remodeling, and improve cardiac function."}

Oxidative stress and the inflammatory response play critical roles in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Carvedilol is a \u03b2-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. In this study, we investigated whether carvedilol had a protective effect against hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and inflammation in microglial BV2 cells. Our results indicate that hypoxic exposure significantly reduced mean cell viability of BV2 microglia, which was significantly restored by carvedilol (10 and 50\u03bcM). In addition, carvedilol treatment significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Administration of carvedilol significantly inhibited expression of IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 at both the mRNA and protein levels. Mechanistically, we found that hypoxia significantly increased phosphorylation of IKK, I\u03baB\u03b1, and NF-\u03baB p65. However, treatment with carvedilol inhibited phosphorylation of these molecules. Notably, hypoxia resulted in a significant nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65, which was inhibited by administration of carvedilol. Luciferase reporter assay results demonstrate that treatment with carvedilol inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in NF-\u03baB binding activity. These data suggest that carvedilol may be of potential use as a novel therapy against hypoxia or ischemia."}

Plasma concentrations of carvedilol were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography-MS at the designated time points after drug administration, and the main PK parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis. In addition, effects of citalopram on the metabolic rate of carvedilol were investigated using rat-pooled liver microsome incubation systems.During co-administration, significant increases of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve as well as of the peak plasma concentration were observed. The rat-pooled liver microsome incubation experiment indicated that citalopram could decrease the metabolic rate of carvedilol.Citalopram co-administration led to a significant alteration of carvedilol's PK profile in rats; it also demonstrated, in vitro, these effects could be explained by the existence of a drug-drug interaction mediated by CYP2D6 inhibition."}

Carvedilol absorbs UV like a sunscreen; thus, to separate pharmacological from sunscreen effects, 4-hydroxycarbazole (4-OHC), which absorbs UV to the same degree as carvedilol, served as control. JB6 P+ cells, an established epidermal model for studying tumor promotion, were used for evaluating the effect of carvedilol on UV-induced neoplastic transformation. Both carvedilol and 4-OHC (1 \u03bcmol/L) blocked transformation induced by chronic UV (15 mJ/cm2) exposure for 8 weeks. However, EGF-mediated transformation was inhibited by only carvedilol but not by 4-OHC. Carvedilol (1 and 5 \u03bcmol/L), but not 4-OHC, attenuated UV-induced AP-1 and NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter activity, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory activity. In a single-dose UV (200 mJ/cm2)-induced skin inflammation mouse model, carvedilol (10 \u03bcmol/L), applied topically after UV exposure, reduced skin hyperplasia and the levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, IL1\u03b2, IL6, and COX-2 in skin. In SKH-1 mice exposed to gradually increasing levels of UV (50-150 mJ/cm2) three times a week for 25 weeks, topical administration of carvedilol (10 \u03bcmol/L) after UV exposure increased tumor latency compared with control (week 18 vs. 15), decreased incidence and multiplicity of squamous cell carcinomas, while 4-OHC had no effect.

At present, there is no effective standardized therapy for acute myocarditis, besides the optimal care of heart failure and arrhythmias in accordance with evidence-based guidelines and specific etiology-driven therapy for infectious myocarditis. Carvedilol has been shown to be cardioprotective by reducing cardiac pro-inflammatory cytokines present in oxidative stress in certain heart diseases. However, effects of carvedilol administration in acute myocarditis with its impact on matrix metalloproteinases' (MMPs) activation have not been elucidated.Carvedilol in 3 doses (2, 10, and 30 mg/kg) was given daily to 3 study groups of rats (n = 8) with experimental autoimmune myocarditis by gastric gavage for 3 weeks. In comparison to untreated rats (n = 8) with induced myocarditis, carvedilol significantly prevented the left ventricle enlargement and/or systolic dysfunction depending on the dose in study groups. Performed zymography showed enhanced MMP-2 activity in untreated rats, while carvedilol administration reduced alterations. This was accompanied by prevention of troponin I release and myofilaments degradation in cardiac muscle tissue. Additionally, severe inflammatory cell infiltration was detected in the nontreated group. Carvedilol in all doses tested, had no impact on severity of inflammation. The severity of inflammation did not differ between study groups and in relation to the untreated group.The protective effects of carvedilol on heart function observed in the acute phase of experimental autoimmune myocarditis seem to be associated with its ability to decrease MMP-2 activity and subsequently prevent degradation of myofilaments and release of troponin I while not related to suppression of inflammation."}

In this paper the ability of the filamentous fungus C.\u00a0echinulata to eliminate the \u03b2-blocker has been described for the first time. An 83% loss of carvedilol was observed after 120\u00a0h incubation of the tested fungus with the compound, where hydroxylated carvedilol metabolites were identified as the major biotransformation products. Carvedilol degradation by C.\u00a0echinulata was proceeded by hydroxylation and conjugation reactions similar to its mammalian metabolism. Glucose conjugate was found in the fungi cultures, whereas glucuronide conjugates were detected in mammals. The impact of carvedilol on the functionality of fungal cells was also evaluated. A 2-fold decrease in the PC/PE ratio was noticed in the C.\u00a0echinulata cell membrane after the exposition to carvedilol compared to control mycelium incubated without the \u03b2-blocker.

This study aims to investigate the implications of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol enantiomers using an integrated population pharmacokinetic modelling approach. In total, 14 T2DM patients with good glycaemic control receiving standard doses of metformin and glibenclamide were evaluated along with a control group of 13 healthy subjects. Serial blood samples were collected up to 24h after administration of a single 25mg dose of racemic carvedilol. A multicompartmental population pharmacokinetic model describing the enantioselective disposition of the parent compound, OHC and DMC was developed in NONMEM v7.2. Even though data are limited, it appears that despite inhibition of CYP2C9 due to long-term glibenclamide administration to T2DM patients, overall no differences are observed in the total clearance of carvedilol when compared to healthy subjects (43.1 vs. 45.9L/h for (S)-(-)-carvedilol and 29.0 vs. 33.1L/h for (R)-(+)-carvedilol). These results provide evidence of a compensatory mechanism for the inhibition of CYP2C9, with higher contribution of CYP2D6 activity to the elimination of carvedilol.

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is responsible for hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and the accumulation of collagen that occurs in hepatic fibrogenesis. Carvedilol has been widely used for the complication of hepatic cirrhosis in the clinic. Furthermore, it has powerful antioxidant properties. We assessed the potential antifibrotic effects of carvedilol and the underlying mechanisms that may further enhance its clinical benefits. Methods. Using a bile duct ligation rat model of hepatic fibrosis, we studied the effects of carvedilol on the fibrosis, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress based on histology, immunohistochemistry, western blot, and RT-PCR analyses. Results. Carvedilol attenuated liver fibrosis, as evidenced by reduced hydroxyproline content and the accumulation of collagen, downregulated TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, and upregulated MMP-13. MMP-2 was an exception, which was decreased after carvedilol treatment for 2 weeks and upregulated after carvedilol treatment for 4 weeks. Carvedilol reduced the activation of HSCs, decreased the induction of collagen, transforming growth factor-\u03b21, and MDA content, and strengthened the SOD activity. The antifibrotic effects were augmented as dosages increased. Conclusions. The study indicates that carvedilol attenuated hepatic fibrosis in a dose-dependent manner. It can decrease collagen accumulation and HSCs activation by the amelioration of oxidative stress."}

The middle dose of carvedilol significantly decreased left ventricular weight, whereas the higher dose decreased total heart, left and right ventricular weight and wet lung weight compared to untreated transverse aortic constriction mice. The higher dose of carvedilol significantly increased cardiac performance as measured by ejection fraction and fractional shortening and decreased left ventricular end systolic volume consistent with the beneficial effect on cardiac function. End-study plasma sST-2 and Gal-3 levels did not differ among sham, transverse aortic constriction control and transverse aortic constriction carvedilol groups. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentrations were elevated significantly in transverse aortic constriction control animals (~150%) compared to shams in association with changes in ejection fraction and heart weight and tended to decrease (~30%, p\u2009=\u20090.10-0.12) with the mid- and high-dose carvedilol treatment.A comparison of carvedilol hemodynamic and structural effects in the mouse transverse aortic constriction model versus clinical use indicates a strong agreement in effect profiles preclinical versus clinical, providing important translational validation for this widely used animal model.

Carvedilol co-treatment did not reduce the anti-tumor effects of oxaliplatin in human colon cancer cells (HT-29), but exhibited free radical scavenging activity against oxaliplatin-induced oxidative stress in neuronal cells (Neuro-2a). Hence, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of carvedilol in the experimental model of oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) in Sprague-Dawley rats. Oxaliplatin reduced the sensory nerve conduction velocity and produced the thermal and mechanical nociception. Carvedilol significantly (P<0.001) attenuated these functional and sensorimotor deficits. It also counteracted oxidative/nitrosative stress by reducing the levels of nitrotyrosine and improving the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase expression in both sciatic nerve and DRG tissues. It improved the mitochondrial function and prevented the oxaliplatin-induced alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential in sciatic nerve thus prevented loss of intra epidermal nerve fiber density in the foot pads. Together the results prompt the use of carvedilol along with chemotherapy with oxaliplatin to prevent the peripheral neuropathy."}

Carvedilol is mainly metabolized by glucuronidation, by CYP2D6 to hydroxyphenylcarvedilol (OHC), and by CYP2C9 to O-desmethylcarvedilol (DMC). This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics of carvedilol enantiomers and their metabolites OHC and DMC in healthy volunteers (n = 13) and in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with good glycemic control (n = 13). The healthy subjects were enrolled to receive either a 25-mg oral single dose of carvedilol alone (no DDI) or carvedilol simultaneously with 5 mg glibenclamide and 500 mg metformin (DDI), whereas type 2 diabetes mellitus patients who were on long-term treatment with glibenclamide (5 mg/8 h) and metformin (500 mg/8 h) were enrolled to receive only a single oral dose of 25 mg carvedilol. The plasma concentrations of the (R)-(+)-carvedilol, (R)-(+)-DMC, and (R)-(+)-OHC were higher than those of (S)-(-)-carvedilol, (S)-(-)-DMC, and (S)-(-)-OHC in all investigated groups. The pharmacokinetics of the carvedilol enantiomers did not differ between the groups. However, the AUC values of the DMC enantiomers were lower in the type 2 diabetes mellitus patients than in the healthy volunteers (DDI and no DDI) [(R)-(+), 6.9, 10.4, 11.9 ng\u00b7h/mL; and (S)-(-), 2.4, 4.3, 4.0 ng\u00b7h/mL, respectively]. In contrast, the AUC values of the OHC enantiomers were higher in the type 2 diabetes mellitus patients [(R)-(+), 13.9, 6.6, 4.9 ng\u00b7h/mL; and (S)-(-), 7.2, 1.5, 1.5 ng\u00b7h/mL], which explains the fact that the carvedilol pharmacokinetics was unchanged."}

{"keyword": "Cefaclor", "texts": "PURPOSE:Cefaclor, a second-generation oral cephalosporin, is known to cause IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. Assays of serum-specific IgE (sIgE) to cefaclor are commercially available via the ImmunoCAP system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). While serum levels of sIgE >0.35 kU/L are considered indicative of an allergy, some patients with cefaclor allergy show low serum IgE levels. This study aimed to evaluate the proper cut-off levels of sIgE in the diagnosis of immediate hypersensitivity to cefaclor. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A total of 269 patients with drug allergy history, who underwent assays of sIgE to cefaclor at Ajou University hospital and Dong-A University Hospital, were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, 193 patients exhibited cefaclor-induced immediate hypersensitivity with certain or probable causality of an adverse drug reaction according to the WHO-UMC (the World Health Organization-the Uppsala Monitoring Centre) algorithm, and 76 controls showed delayed hypersensitivity reactions to non-antibiotics. RESULTS:In total, 126 of the 193 patients (65.3%) experienced anaphylaxis; they had higher serum sIgE levels than patients with immediate hypersensitivity who did not experience anaphylaxis (6.36\u00b112.39 kU/L vs. 4.28\u00b113.61 kU/L, p<0.001). The best cut-off value for cefaclor-induced immediate hypersensitivity was 0.11 kU/L, with sensitivity of 80.2% and specificity of 81.6%. A cut-off value of 0.44 kU/L showed the best sensitivity (75.4%) and specificity (65.7%) for differentiating anaphylaxis from immediate hypersensitivity reactions. CONCLUSION:Patients with cefaclor anaphylaxis exhibit high serum IgE levels. A cut-off value of 0.11 kU/L of sIgE to cefaclor is proper for identifying patients with cefaclor allergy, and 0.44 kU/L may be useful to detect anaphylaxis."}

For survival of microbes, metal intake and accessibility should be according to their physiological requirements. Peculiarly, copper homeostasis is critical for E. coli survival and growth. Therefore in this study, an extensive work is conducted to investigate the impact of Cu(II)-doping on the susceptibility of Escherichia coli ATCC 10536 against Cu(II)-selective Cefaclor-silver nanoconjugates (i.e., Cf-AgNPs) and its organic precursor (i.e. Cefaclor). At first, the maximal non-cytotoxic dose of Cu(II) that was sub-lethal for Escherichia coli was determined by MTT assay and was found to be 100\u202f\u03bcg/L. Afterwards, MICs of Cf-AgNPs and Cefaclor against controlled and Cu(II)-doped E. coli cells were determined by using Agar well diffusion method. The susceptibility of E. coli cells against Cf-AgNPs was increased upon Cu(II) doping, whereas the bactericidal activity of Cefaclor against Cu(II)-doped E. coli cells was retarded due to hydrolysis. In addition, morphological changes induced in controlled and Cu(II)-doped samples of E. coli after treatment with Cefaclor and Cf-AgNPs were also monitored by Atomic force microscopy (AFM). The obtained results from both Agar well diffusion method and AFM confirmed that Cf-AgNPs are more effective against Cu(II)-doped Escherichia coli. Moreover, thermal profile of Cu(II)-selective Cf-AgNPs was also demonstrated by TGA and DSC. This study can be an important part of the relevant state-of-the-art. Indeed, further clinical studies are necessary to determine the relevant role of Cf-AgNPs compared with that of the Cefaclor now available."}

MATERIAL AND METHODS:Human APC were tested for in vitro cytotoxicity of modified Triple Antibiotic Paste (mTAP - Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole and Cefaclor at 1:1:1) and of a paste of Ciprofloxacin, Metronidazole and Calcium hydroxide (CMC - 1:1:2) and modified CMC (mCMC - 2:2:1) by using MTT assay. The substances were reconstituted in DMEM at 1,000 \u00b5g/mL and \u00bc serially diluted before being kept in contact with cells for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. Further, cells were primed with 1 \u00b5g/mL of Enterococcus faecalis LTA for 7 days prior to the viability test with 1,000 \u00b5g/mL of each substance. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA respectively followed by Tukey's post-test. Significance levels were set at p<0.05. RESULTS:In the first assay, the higher cytotoxic rates were reached by mTAP for all experimental periods. CMC was found toxic for APC at 5 and 7 days, whereas mCMC did not affect the cell viability. Only CMC and mCMC were able to induce some cellular proliferation. In the second assay, when considering the condition with medium only, LTA-primed cells significantly proliferated in comparison to LTA-untreated ones. At this context, mTAP and CMC showed similar cytotoxicity than the observed for LTA-untreated cells, while mCMC was shown cytotoxic at 7 days only for LTA-primed APC. Comparing the medications, mTAP was more cytotoxic than CMC and mCMC. CONCLUSION:mTAP showed higher cytotoxicity than CMC and mCMC and the effect of topic antimicrobials might differ when tested against apical papilla cells under physiological or activated conditions."}

Although localised drug administration, via an implanted scaffold, has shown promise in a clinical setting, the ideal scaffold cross-linking (to initially withstand the aggressive infection environment) and drug (to be effective against infection) have yet to be identified. In this work, in the first instance, the biochemical, biophysical, and biological properties of collagen sponges as a function of various concentrations (0.625%, 1.0%, 2.5%, 5.0%, and 10.0%) of hexamethylene diisocyanate were assessed. Data presented illustrate that hexamethylene diisocyanate at 0.625% concentration was able to effectively stabilise collagen scaffolds, as judged by the reduction in free amines, adequate resistance to collagenase digestion, reduction in swelling, increase in denaturation temperature, suitable mechanical properties, and appropriate cytocompatibility. Subsequently, collagen scaffolds stabilised with 0.625% hexamethylene diisocyanate were loaded with variable concentrations (0, 10, 100, and 500 \u03bcg ml-1) of Cefaclor and Ranalexin. Both drugs exhibited similar loading efficiency, release profile, and cytocompatibility. However, only collagen scaffolds loaded with 100 \u03bcg ml-1 Cefaclor exhibited adequate antibacterial properties against both 106 and 108 colony-forming units per ml of both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis."}

{"keyword": "Cefaclor", "texts": "An increase in the copper pool in body fluids has been related to a number of pathological conditions, including infections. Copper ions may affect antibiotics via the formation of coordination bonds and/or redox reactions. Herein, we analyzed the interactions of Cu2+ with eight \u03b2-lactam antibiotics using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, EPR spectroscopy, and electrochemical methods. Penicillin G did not show any detectable interactions with Cu2+. Ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalexin formed stable colored complexes with octahedral coordination environment of Cu2+ with tetragonal distortion, and primary amine group as the site of coordinate bond formation. These \u03b2-lactams increased the solubility of Cu2+ in the phosphate buffer. Ceftazidime and Cu2+ formed a complex with a similar geometry and gave rise to an organic radical. Ceftriaxone-Cu2+ complex appears to exhibit different geometry. All complexes showed 1:1 stoichiometry. Cefaclor reduced Cu2+ to Cu1+ that further reacted with molecular oxygen to produce hydrogen peroxide. Finally, meropenem underwent degradation in the presence of copper. The analysis of activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the effects of meropenem, amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ceftriaxone were significantly hindered in the presence of copper ions. The interactions with copper ions should be taken into account regarding the problem of antibiotic resistance and in the selection of the most efficient antimicrobial therapy for patients with altered copper homeostasis."}

As its consumption increases, the number of hypersensitivity reactions to cefaclor has increased. This study aimed to evaluate the immunologic findings of immediate hypersensitivity to cefaclor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 47 patients with immediate hypersensitivity to cefaclor from Ajou University Hospital and Asan Medical Center. Serum specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 antibodies to cefaclor-human serum albumin (HSA) conjugate were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The most common phenotype was anaphylaxis (Group I, 78.7%), followed by urticaria (Group II, 21.3%). The detection of specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG4 to cefaclor-HSA conjugate by ELISA tended to be higher in Group I (40.5%, 41.7%, 21.6%) than in Group II (20.0%, 20.0%, 0%) with no statistical significance. Significant associations were found between specific IgE and IgG1 or IgG4 (p<0.001, p=0.019). ELISA inhibition tests showed significant inhibitions by both free cefaclor and cefaclor-HSA conjugate. For basophil activation tests in patients having no specific IgE antibody, the CD63 expression level on basophils increased with incubations of free cefaclor. CONCLUSION: The most common manifestation of immediate hypersensitivity to cefaclor was anaphylaxis, most of which was mediated by IgE; however, a non-IgE mediated direct basophil activation mechanism was suggested in a subset of anaphylaxis patients."}

The LRK is a unique ecosystem displaying a combination of Dry Rann and Wet Rann. A total of 25 bacteria were isolated and characterized on the basis of colony morphology, biochemical profile, sugar utilization, secretion of the extracellular enzymes and antibiotic sensitivity. Further, the identification and phylogenetic relatedness of 23 bacteria were established by the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolates belong to the phylum Firmicutes, comprising low G\u00a0+\u00a0C, Gram-positive bacteria, with different genera: Bacillus (~\u00a039%), Staphylococcus (~\u00a030%), Halobacillus (~\u00a013%), Virgibacillus (~\u00a013%), Oceanobacillus (~\u00a04%). Majority of the bacterial isolates produced proteases (30% isolates) followed by cellulases (24% isolates), CMCases (24% isolates) and amylases (20% isolates). Halobacillus, Virgibacillus and Bacillus predominantly produced hydrolases, while many produced multiple enzymes at high salinity and alkaline pH. Highest antibiotic resistance was observed against Ampicillin and Penicillin (32%) followed by Cefaclor (20%); Colistin, Cefoperazone and Cefotaxime (16%); Cefuroxime (12%); Gentamycin and Cefixime (8%); Erythromycin, Cefadroxil, Azithromycin, Co-trimoxazole, Amoxycillin, Norfloxacin, Cefpodoxime, Amikacin and Augmentin (4%). KJ1-10-99 and KJ1-10-93 representing\u00a0<\u00a097% of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity belong to a novel lineage within the family Bacillaceae. Comparison of the phenogram and phylogram revealed the contradiction of the phenogram pattern and the phylogenetic placement of the isolates. The isolates belonging to same species have shown considerable phenotypic variation.

From our normal MD and QM/MM simulations, the correlation coefficients between the predicted binding free energies and experimental values are .88 and .93, respectively. Then simulations, which combined QM/MM/GBSA and alanine-scanning mutagenesis techniques, were performed and our results show that two residues (Lys211 and His250) have the strongest impact on the binding affinities of the 11 NDM-1/inhibitors. Therefore, our approach theoretically suggests that the two residues (Lys211 and His250) are responsible for the selectivity of NDM-1 associated inhibitors."}
{"keyword": "Cefaclor", "texts": "AIM: The duration of therapy represents a fundamental aspect in the compliance to the therapy of child pathologies, such as pharyngotonsillitis, treated with oral therapy. Although penicillin and amoxicillin are the first choice antibiotics in the case of a child suffering from pharyngotonsillitis with the proven presence of Group A \u03b2-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS), the number of orally administered doses and 10 days of therapy, considerably lower the compliance. METHODS: An open phase IV randomized multicenter clinical trial was conducted in parallel groups, involving 49 family pediatrician (FP), distributed over the entire national territory, enrolling 435 children suffering from GAS-FT. 210 children received Cefaclor, 50 mg/kg/day, administered twice daily for five days, whilst 213 children received amoxicillin/clavulanate 40 mg/kg/day administered twice daily for 10 days. RESULTS: The results showed percentages of eradication of 88.4% for the Cefaclor group and 94.3% for the amoxicillin/clavulanate group, and a positive clinical judgement of 92.3% for the Cefaclor group and 96.6% for the amoxicillin/clavulanate group. The two arms of the study did not have any significant statistical differences, neither for the eradication, nor for the clinical judgement nor for the reduction of the Milano Score between the beginning and the end of treatment, with a P=0.042 for amoxicillin/clavulanate for eradication. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the administration of Cefaclor for five days during GAS-FT has the same efficacy as a 10-day therapy with amoxicillin/clavulanate, with a clearly different compliance."}

The clinical manifestations of C. difficile infection (CDI) may range from mild diarrhea to fulminant colitis. Clostridium difficile should be considered in diarrhea cases with a history of antibiotic use within the last 8 weeks (community-associated CDI) or with a hospital stay of at least 3 days, regardless of the duration of antibiotic use (hospital-acquired CDI).This study investigated the frequency of CDI in diarrheic patients and evaluated the efficacy of the triple diagnostic algorithm that is proposed here for C. difficile detection.Cross-sectional study.In this study, we compared three methods currently employed for C. difficile detection using 95 patient stool samples: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for toxin A/B (C. diff Toxin A+B; Diagnostic Automation Inc.; Calabasas, CA, USA), an EIA for glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (C. DIFF CHEK-60TM, TechLab Inc.; Blacksburg, VA, USA), and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay (GeneXpert(\u00ae) C. difficile; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) that detects C. difficile toxin genes and conventional methods as well. In this study, 50.5% of the patients were male, 50 patients were outpatients, 32 were from inpatient clinics and 13 patients were from the intensive care unit.Of the 95 stool samples tested for GDH, 28 were positive. Six samples were positive by PCR, while nine samples were positive for toxin A/B. The hypervirulent strain NAP-1 and binary toxin was not detected. The rate of occurrence of toxigenic C. difficile was 5.1% in the samples. Cefaclor, ampicillin-sulbactam, ertapenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most commonly used antibiotics by patients preceding the onset of diarrhea. Among the patients who were hospitalized in an intensive care unit for more than 7 days, 83.3% were positive for CDI by PCR screening. If the PCR test is accepted as the reference: C. difficile Toxin A/B ELISA sensitivity and specificity were 67% and 94%, respectively, and GDH sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 75%, respectively.Tests targeting C. difficile toxins are frequently applied for the purpose of diagnosing CDI in a clinical setting. However, changes in the temperature and reductant composition of the feces may affect toxin stability, potentially yielding false-negative test results. Therefore, employment of a GDH EIA, which has high sensitivity, as a screening test for the detection of toxigenic strains, may prevent false-negative results, and its adoption as part of a multistep diagnostic algorithm may increase accuracy in the diagnosis of CDIs."}

METHODS:We investigated hydrocortisone recovery after passage through NG tubes in vitro for three formulations: liquid suspension, crushed tablets mixed with water, and hydrocortisone granules designed for oral administration to children. Cortisol was measured by LC-MS/MS. RESULTS:Hydrocortisone content was variable and recovery low after preparation in syringe and prior to passage through NG tubes. For doses, 0.5 and 2.0\u00a0mg mean percentage recovery was as follows: liquid suspension 57% and 58%; crushed tablets 46% and 30%; and hydrocortisone granules 78% and 71%. Flushing the administering syringe increased recovery. Hydrocortisone recovery after passage with flushing through 6-12Fr gauge NG tubes was variable: liquid suspension 61%-92%, crushed tablets 40%-174%, hydrocortisone granules 61%-92%. Administration of hydrocortisone granules occluded 6 and 8Fr NG tubes; however, administration using a sampling needle to prevent granules being administered gave a recovery of 74%-98%. CONCLUSIONS:The administration of hydrocortisone through NG tubes is possible; however, current methods deliver a variable dose of hydrocortisone, generally less than that prescribed. Attention should be placed on the technique used to optimize drug delivery such as flushing of the administering syringe. Hydrocortisone granules block small NG tubes but behaved as well as the commonly used liquid suspension when prepared with a filtering needle that filters out granules."}

Hydrocortisone is increasingly used as an alternative, but evidence supporting its efficacy and safety is lacking. Objective:To assess the effect of hydrocortisone initiated between 7 and 14 days after birth on death or BPD in very preterm infants. Design, Setting, and Participants:Double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial conducted in 19 neonatal intensive care units in the Netherlands and Belgium from November 15, 2011, to December 23, 2016, among preterm infants with a gestational age of less than 30 weeks and/or birth weight of less than 1250 g who were ventilator dependent between 7 and 14 days of life, with follow-up to hospital discharge ending December 12, 2017. Interventions:Infants were randomly assigned to receive a 22-day course of systemic hydrocortisone (cumulative dose, 72.5 mg/kg) (n\u2009=\u2009182) or placebo (n\u2009=\u2009190). Main Outcomes and Measures:The primary outcome was a composite of death or BPD assessed at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Twenty-nine secondary outcomes were analyzed up to hospital discharge, including death and BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. Results:Among 372 patients randomized (mean gestational age, 26 weeks; 55% male), 371 completed the trial; parents withdrew consent for 1 child treated with hydrocortisone. Death or BPD occurred in 128 of 181 infants (70.7%) randomized to hydrocortisone and in 140 of 190 infants (73.7%) randomized to placebo (adjusted risk difference, -3.6% [95% CI, -12.7% to 5.4%]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54-1.38]; P\u2009=\u2009.54). Of 29 secondary outcomes, 8 showed significant differences, including death at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (15.5% with hydrocortisone vs 23.7% with placebo; risk difference, -8.2% [95% CI, -16.2% to -0.1%]; odds ratio, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.35-0.995]; P\u2009=\u2009.048). Twenty-one outcomes showed nonsignificant differences, including BPD (55.2% with hydrocortisone vs 50.0% with placebo; risk difference, 5.2% [95% CI, -4.9% to 15.2%]; odds ratio, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.82-1.86]; P\u2009=\u2009.31). Hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy was the only adverse effect reported more often in the hydrocortisone group (18.2%) than in the placebo group (7.9%). Conclusions and Relevance:Among mechanically ventilated very preterm infants, administration of hydrocortisone between 7 and 14 days after birth, compared with placebo, did not improve the composite outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone for this indication. Trial Registration:Netherlands National Trial Register Identifier: NTR2768."}

The number of hours spent with blood glucose \u2265 180\u200amg/dl was higher in the HC continuous infusion group with a median of 64\u200ahours [IQR (2-100)] versus 48\u200ahours [IQR (14-107)] in the HC bolus group, (p\u200a=\u200a0.60), and daily insulin requirements were similar between the two groups, (p\u200a=\u200a0.63). The occurrence of other side effects, mortality and ICU LOS were similar between the study groups. CONCLUSION:Hydrocortisone administered by intermittent bolus was associated with higher shock reversal at day 7 compared with a continuous infusion."}

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "OBJECTIVES:Rectal application of steroids and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) is associated with few side effects and has a high therapeutic efficacy in left-sided colitis. Previous studies have shown that rectal administration of both steroids and 5-ASA is superior to one single alone. However, some reports are still controversial. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the treatment choice and efficacy of these different enemas in distal ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Questionnaire survey and a retrospective study were carried out in Chinese hospitals to investigate the efficacy of 5-ASA or hydrocortisone/dexamethasone or their combination enema in patients with distal active UC. Dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice was also utilized to evaluate the effects in vivo. RESULTS:The results from questionnaire survey showed that majority of physicians would prefer oral 5-ASA with topical 5-ASA therapy for distal UC patients. However, 43.01% of physicians would like to choose oral 5-ASA and topical hydrocortisone/dexamethasone with or without 5-ASA enema. A retrospective study demonstrated that 5-ASA enema or 5-ASA combined with hydrocortisone/dexamethasone enema therapy was superior to hydrocortisone/dexamethasone enema to decrease C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Mayo score and induce clinical remission and clinical response. No superiority of combination therapy was further proved in DSS-induced colitis in mice. CONCLUSIONS:Although 43.01% of physicians would like to choose hydrocortisone/dexamethasone with or without 5-ASA enema for the treatment of distal UC, the combination was not superior to 5-ASA enema. Hydrocortisone/dexamethasone enema with 5-ASA enema is not recommended for distal active UC patients."}

A small minority of children experience low cortisol concentrations and symptoms of cortisol insufficiency, poorly responsive to modifications in dosing. We speculated that treatment with modified-release hydrocortisone Plenadren\u00ae may be beneficial in these selected patients. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this article was to report cortisol profiles during treatment with standard formulation hydrocortisone and Plenadren, and growth and weight gain during treatment with Plenadren in selected children with adrenal insufficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Data are reported as median (range). Eight patients (5 male) age 11.0\u00a0years (8.8-13.3), with adrenal insufficiency for 4.3\u00a0years (2.2-10.0) were treated with Plenadren in doses derived from cortisol concentrations measured during treatment with standard formulation hydrocortisone. RESULTS:Plasma cortisol was 262\u00a0nmol/L (114-654) 2\u00a0h after the morning dose (hydrocortisone dose 6.1\u00a0mg/m2 [4.3-7.1]) of standard formulation hydrocortisone. After 4\u00a0h, cortisol concentration was 81\u00a0nmol/L (56-104) and was <\u00a0100\u00a0nmol/L in six patients. Two hours after Plenadren administration (hydrocortisone dose 12.1\u00a0mg/m2 [8.3-17.6]), plasma cortisol concentration was 349\u00a0nmol/L (150-466), and after 4\u00a0h it was 239\u00a0nmol/L (99-375) and <\u00a0100\u00a0nmol/L in one patient. Six hours after the Plenadren dose, cortisol concentration was <\u00a0100\u00a0nmol/L in four patients and after 8\u00a0h cortisol concentration was <\u00a0100\u00a0nmol/L in seven patients (sample not obtained in one patient). Six patients elected to continue treatment with Plenadren. After 4.2\u00a0years (2.7-6.0), change in height standard deviation score (SDS) was 0.1 SD (- 0.2 to 0.2) and body mass index SDS was 0.3 SD (0-1.1). CONCLUSION:Smoother cortisol profiles and more sustained cortisol exposure were achieved during treatment with Plenadren, which was the preferred treatment in most patients. Robust clinical trials are required to determine the place of this medication in paediatric practice."}

However, in placebo controlled trials, the effects of GH replacement are no different from placebo. Hydrocortisone dose\u2009>\u200920\u00a0mg/day and pituitary radiation are independently associated with poorer QoL. We assessed QoL in panhypopituitary GH- deficient patients never treated with GH. METHODS:Study group was divided into: (a) surgery followed by radiation (n\u2009=\u200921) and (b) surgery alone (n\u2009=\u200932). Mean duration of GHD was 71.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8 months and mean daily hydrocortisone dose was 15\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7\u00a0mg. Control group had transnasal surgery for benign sinus conditions (n\u2009=\u200954). RESULTS:AGHDA scores were significantly worse in the entire study group compared to controls (8.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.0 vs. 5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9, p\u2009=\u20090.03). In patients with history of radiation therapy AGHDA scores were significantly worse than in controls (9.1\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5, p\u2009=\u20090.02) and SNOT-22 (Sino-Nasal Outcome Test) scores were also significantly worse (15.8\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0 vs. 23.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.5, p\u2009=\u20090.04). However, AGHDA scores in patients without history of radiation and on \"physiological\" dose of hydrocortisone were similar to those in controls (5.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 vs. 7.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3, p\u2009=\u20090.17). CONCLUSIONS:Replacement with hydrocortisone doses not exceeding 20\u00a0mg/day and avoidance of radiation therapy was accompanied by normal QoL in patients not replaced with GH. Thus, we suggest that the decreased QoL in hypopituitary patients may not be due to GH deficiency per se, but rather to high hydrocortisone doses and to aftereffects of cranial radiation."}

Reduced cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability are observed during acute stress and are associated with an increased risk of acute cardiac events. In the present study, healthy young men received either a single iv bolus of saline (placebo) or hydrocortisone, 1\u00a0week apart, in accordance with a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. Hydrocortisone acutely increased heart rate and blood pressure and reduced cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability in young men. These findings suggest that, by reducing cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability, acute surges in cortisol facilitate a pro-arrhythmic milieu and provide an important mechanistic link between stress and acute cardiac events ABSTRACT: Surges in cortisol concentration during acute stress may increase cardiovascular risk. To better understand the interactions between cortisol and the autonomic nervous system, we determined the acute effects of hydrocortisone administration on cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), heart rate variability (HRV) and cardiovascular reactivity. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded cross-over study, 10 healthy males received either a single iv bolus of saline (placebo) or 200\u00a0mg of hydrocortisone, 1\u00a0week apart. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and limb blood flow were monitored 3 h later, at rest and during the sequential infusion of sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine (modified Oxford Technique), a cold pressor test and a mental arithmetic stress task. HRV was assessed using the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between successive R-R intervals (rMSSD). Hydrocortisone markedly increased serum cortisol 3 h following infusion and also compared to placebo. In addition, hydrocortisone elevated resting HR (+7\u00a0\u00b1 4\u00a0beats\u00a0min-1 ; P\u00a0< 0.001) and systolic BP (+5\u00a0\u00b1 5\u00a0mmHg; P\u00a0= 0.008); lowered cardiovagal BRS [geometric mean (95% confidence interval) 15.6 (11.1-22.1)\u00a0ms/mmHg vs. 26.2 (17.4--39.5)\u00a0ms/mmHg, P\u00a0= 0.011] and HRV (rMSSD 59\u00a0\u00b1 29\u00a0ms vs. 84\u00a0\u00b1 38\u00a0ms, P\u00a0= 0.004) and increased leg vasoconstrictor responses to cold pressor test (\u0394 leg vascular conductance -45\u00a0\u00b1 20% vs. -23\u00a0\u00b1 26%; P\u00a0= 0.023).

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "Glucocorticoids and noradrenaline can enhance memory consolidation but impair memory retrieval. Beyond their effects on quantitative memory performance, these major stress mediators bias the engagement of multiple memory systems toward \"habitual\" control during learning. However, if and how glucocorticoids and noradrenaline may also affect which memory system is recruited during recall, thereby affecting the control of retrieval, remain largely unknown. To address these questions, we trained healthy participants in a probabilistic classification learning task, which can be supported both by cognitive and habitual strategies. Approximately 24 hr later, participants received a placebo, hydrocortisone, yohimbine (an \u03b12-adrenoceptor antagonist increasing noradrenergic stimulation), or both drugs before they completed a recall test for the probabilistic classification learning task. During training, all groups showed a practice-dependent shift toward more habitual strategies, reflecting an \"automatization\" of behavior. In the recall test, after a night of sleep, this automatization was even more pronounced in the placebo group, most likely due to offline consolidation processes and with beneficial effects on recall performance. Hydrocortisone or yohimbine intake abolished this further automatization, preventing the shift to a more efficient memory system and leading, in particular in the hydrocortisone group, to impaired recall performance. Our results suggest that glucocorticoids and noradrenergic stimulation may modulate the engagement of different strategies at recall and link the well-known stress hormone-induced retrieval deficit to a change in the system controlling memory retrieval."}

We hereby report a case of isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency developing in a patient with squamous cell lung cancer (SCC) during nivolumab therapy. Case:A 79-year-old man with SCC was started on nivolumab therapy as a fifth-line treatment after 4 lines of cytotoxic anticancer therapy. After 20 courses of nivolumab therapy, he had nausea, appetite loss, and difficulty walking. A close laboratory examination led to the diagnosis of isolated ACTH deficiency in this patient. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy led to amelioration of his symptoms and allowed him to continue with nivolumab therapy. The present case of isolated ACTH deficiency was characterized by a slowly progressive decline in the serum sodium level, which became manifest well before appearance of any clinical symptoms, suggesting that the serum sodium level may be used to predict progression to isolated ACTH deficiency.Thus, not only serum sodium levels need to be monitored in patients suspected of having isolated ACTH deficiency, but ACTH and cortisol levels need to be monitored in those exhibiting a decline in serum sodium levels. Again, nivolumab-induced isolated ACTH deficiency needs to be appropriately diagnosed and treated to ensure that patients continue with, and maximize survival benefit from, nivolumab therapy."}

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "BACKGROUND Severe sepsis is among the most common causes of death in Emergency Departments, with more than 30% mortality. Hydrocortisone is used in severe sepsis patients who were not responsive to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. However, the effect of hydrocortisone on regulating inflammation, hemodynamic stability, and preventing shock is still unclear in Chinese patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this prospective observational study, we included 105 severe sepsis patients. We measured the level of serum inflammatory cytokines, hemodynamic variables, and phagocytic ability of innate immune cells during the treatment. We analyzed the relationship between these variables and the hydrocortisone treatment. RESULTS We treated 43 (41.0%) patients with hydrocortisone, while the other 62 (59.0%) patients were not, based on their response to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy. The hydrocortisone group had a mean simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II score of 41.8 with standard deviation (SD) of 7.1, while the non-hydrocortisone group had a mean SAPS II score of 36.7 with SD of 7.3. The mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores of these 2 groups were 10.6 and 9.2, respectively. We found an obvious decrease of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-6, after hydrocortisone treatment. However, these changes were not observed in the non-hydrocortisone group. What's more, amelioration of hemodynamic variables was observed after hydrocortisone treatment. No significant association between hydrocortisone treatment and innate immune cell phagocytic function was observed. CONCLUSIONS Based on these results, we believe that hydrocortisone treatment has potential anti-inflammatory, hemodynamic reversal, and stability effects on severe sepsis patients. These key benefits may help patients by preventing septic shock."}

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "The complex interactions and overlapping symptoms of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by an explosive blast wave have become a focus of attention in recent years, making clinical distinction and effective intervention difficult. Because dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is thought to underlie trauma-related (psycho)pathology, we evaluated both the endogenous corticosterone response and the efficacy of exogenous hydrocortisone treatment provided shortly after blast exposure. We employed a controlled experimental blast-wave paradigm in which unanesthetized animals were exposed to visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile effects of an explosive blast wave produced by exploding a thin copper wire. Endogenous corticosterone concentrations were evaluated at different time points (before, and 3\u2009h, 5\u2009h and 17 days) after blast exposure. Subsequently, the efficacy of exogenous hydrocortisone (25\u2009mg/kg-1 or 125\u2009mg/kg-1) injected intraperitoneally 1\u2009h after exposure was compared with that of a similarly timed saline injection. Validated cognitive and behavioral tests were used to assess both PTSD and mTBI phenotypes on days 7-14 following the blast. Retrospective analysis revealed that animals demonstrating the PTSD phenotype exhibited a significantly blunted endogenous corticosterone response to the blast compared with all other groups. Moreover, a single 125\u2009mg/kg-1 dose of hydrocortisone administered 1\u2009h after exposure significantly reduced the occurrence of the PTSD phenotype. Hydrocortisone treatment did not have a similar effect on the mTBI phenotype. Results of this study indicate that an inadequate corticosteroid response following blast exposure increases risk for PTSD phenotype, and corticosteroid treatment is a potential clinical intervention for attenuating PTSD. The differences in patterns of physiological and therapeutic response between PTSD and mTBI phenotypes lend credence to the retrospective behavioral and cognitive classification criteria we designed, and is in keeping with the assumption that mTBI and PTSD phenotypes may reflect distinct underlying biological and clinical profiles."}

Despite this, only two selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors have been approved to date for its treatment by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and treatment results are often disappointing, with a remission rate of <30%. Certain neuroendocrinological systems are currently gaining attention with respect to their use for PTSD prevention and treatment as standalone options or medication-enhanced psychotherapy due to their involvement in physiological stress reactions, memory consolidation and extinction, cognitive appraisal to stress, and attachment and resilient coping strategies, which are important in the pathogenesis of PTSD. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis system takes the most important role in stress reactions. Hydrocortisone has been studied for the prevention of PTSD, and some meta-analyses have suggested its possible efficacy; furthermore, it has been considered both as monotherapy and as an augmentation to psychotherapy in PTSD patients, with some positive results. Glucocorticoid receptor antagonists and corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 antagonists have also been considered for clinical use in PTSD treatment. Additionally, other neuroendocrinological systems have been studied in PTSD including the use of oxytocin for PTSD prevention and augmentation to psychotherapy, allopregnanolone, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) for PTSD treatment. For now, however, these studies offer only limited evidence of efficacy, thus it is prudent to study this issue more vigorously."}

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "RATIONALE:There remains uncertainty about the role of corticosteroids in sepsis with clear beneficial effects on shock duration but conflicting survival effects. Two transcriptomic sepsis response signatures (SRS) have been identified. SRS1 is relatively immunosuppressed whilst SRS2 is relatively immunocompetent. OBJECTIVES:We aimed to categorized patients based on SRS endotypes to determine if these profiles influenced response to either norepinephrine or vasopressin, or to corticosteroids in septic shock. METHODS:A post-hoc analysis was performed of a double-blind randomized clinical trial in septic shock (VANISH). Patients were included within 6 hours of onset of shock and were randomized to receive norepinephrine or vasopressin followed by hydrocortisone or placebo. Genome-wide gene expression profiling was performed and SRS endotype was determined using a previously established model using seven discriminant genes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:Samples were available from 176 patients, 83 SRS1 and 93 SRS2. There was no significant interaction between SRS group and vasopressor assignment (p=0\u00b750). However, there was an interaction between assignment to hydrocortisone or placebo, and SRS endotype (p=0\u00b702). Hydrocortisone use was associated with increased mortality in those with an SRS2 phenotype (OR 7\u00b79, 95%CI 1\u00b76-39\u00b79). CONCLUSIONS:Transcriptomic profile at onset of septic shock was associated with response to corticosteroids. Those with the immuno-competent SRS2 endotype had significantly higher mortality when given corticosteroids compared to placebo.

{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Hydrocortisone (HC), at different dosages, is used in critically ill newborns for lung stability, blood pressure support, and prevention of chronic lung disease (CLD). Its long-term effects on postnatal growth are not well studied. We hypothesized that early exposure to high doses of HC adversely affects growth, growth factors, metabolic hormones, and neurological outcomes, persisting in adulthood. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:Rat pups received a single daily intramuscular dose of HC (1\u202fmg/kg/day, 5\u202fmg/kg/day, or 10\u202fmg/kg/day on days 3, 4 & 5 postnatal age (P3, P4, P5). Age-matched controls received equivalent volume saline. Body weight, linear growth, and neurological outcomes were monitored. Animals were sacrificed at P21, P45, and P70 for blood glucose, insulin, IGF-I, GH, leptin, and corticosterone levels. Liver mRNA expression of IGFs and IGFBPs were determined at P21 and P70. Memory and learning abilities were tested using the Morris water maze test at P70. RESULTS:HC suppressed body weight and length at P12, P21 and P45, but by P70 there was catchup overgrowth in the 5 and 10\u202fmg/kg/day groups. At P70 blood insulin, IGF-I, GH, and leptin levels were low, whereas blood glucose, and liver IGFs and IGFBPs were high in the high dose groups. High HC also caused delayed memory and learning abilities at P70. CONCLUSIONS:These data demonstrate that while higher doses of HC may be required for hemodynamic stability and prevention of CLD, these doses may result in growth deficits, as well as neurological and metabolic sequelae in adulthood."}

Glucocorticoids regulate tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway, which modulates mood and energy homeostasis. Objective:This study investigated whether tryptophan metabolism mediated the effect of HC dose on HRQOL in patients with secondary AI. Design, Setting, and Patients:Forty-seven patients with secondary AI participated in this double-blind randomized controlled cross-over trial in the University Medical Center Groningen. Intervention:Patients were treated for two 10-week periods with a daily HC dose of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg and 0.4 to 0.6 mg/kg body weight, respectively. Main Outcome Measures:Diary data and questionnaires were used to assess HRQOL. Tryptophan, kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine were measured in serum and dialyzed plasma and the kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (Kyn/Trp ratio) ratio was calculated. Results:A higher dose HC was associated with increased levels of tryptophan (95% CI for mean difference 0.37 to 12.5, P = 0.038), reduced levels of kynurenine (95% CI, -0.49 to -0.10, P = 0.004) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (95% CI, -10.6 to -2.35, P = 0.003), and a reduced Kyn/Trp ratio (95% CI, -0.84 to -0.50, P < 0.001). The Kyn/Trp ratio mediated the effect of a higher dose HC on fatigue (P = 0.041) and physical functioning (P = 0.005). Conclusion:Metabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway is reduced after a 10-week treatment with a higher dose HC and plays a role in the effect of HC on fatigue and physical functioning in patients with secondary AI."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS:After preliminary experiments, to define the intravenous dose of hydrocortisone delivered in bilaterally adrenalectomized rats with serum cortisol level similar to sham rats, survival experiments were run in 75 rats after intraperitoneal challenge with Escherichia coli. Rats were treated with placebo, ertapenem, hydrocortisone, and a combination. Sacrifice experiments were run to measure gene transcripts in whole blood and in the liver and to assess cytokine stimulation of splenocytes and tissue overgrowth. RESULTS:The combination of hydrocortisone and ertapenem was superior to any single treatment and mandatory to achieve survival benefit. Splenocytes from infected rats had decreased production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1); this was reversed with hydrocortisone treatment. Hydrocortisone increased the expression of TNF, Il1r2, and Hdac4 and decreased that of Dnmt3a. Bacterial burden of E. coli in kidney was decreased after hydrocortisone treatment. CONCLUSIONS:Low dose of hydrocortisone is a mandatory adjunctive to antimicrobial therapy in a rat model of septic shock after bilateral adrenalectomy. The mechanism of action is related to reversal of sepsis-induced immunosuppression through interaction with histone deacetylases and de novo DNA methyltransferases."}

She had been to the emergency department of her local hospital various times during the first trimester presenting with a clinical scenario suggestive of glucocorticoid under-replacement (nausea, persistent vomiting and hypotension), but this was interpreted as normal pregnancy symptoms. Hydrocortisone dose was adjusted, and the patient maintained regular follow-up. No complications were reported for the remainder of gestation and delivery. Pregnant patients with Addison's disease should be monitored during gestation and in the peripartum period by multidisciplinary teams. Adjustments in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy are often necessary, and monitoring should be based mainly on clinical findings, which becomes increasingly difficult during pregnancy. Patient education and specialized monitoring are key to avoiding complications from under- or over-replacement therapy in this period. Learning points:An increase in glucocorticoid replacement dose is expected to be necessary during pregnancy in a woman with Addison's disease.Patient education regarding steroid cover and symptoms of acute adrenal crisis are fundamental.Monitoring in this period is challenging and remains mainly clinical.The increase in hydrocortisone dose often obviates the need to increase fludrocortisone dose."}
{"keyword": "Hydrocortisone", "texts": "This manuscript summarizes the effect of certain cell culture medium additives on antibody drug substance coloration and acidic charge variants. It has been shown previously that B-vitamins and iron in the cell culture medium could significantly impact color intensity. In this manuscript, we detail the effect of several other cell culture components that have been shown to impact coloration. It is shown that if cystine is used instead of cysteine in the cell culture medium, coloration was reduced. Hydrocortisone has been shown to reduce coloration and boost specific productivity. The effect of a peptone/hydrolysate on coloration was investigated in cell culture experiments, which showed its use can lead to reduced coloration. Mechanisms by which these compounds influence coloration will be briefly discussed. Since it has been previously shown that antibody oxidation could potentially lead to coloration, the current effort was focused on screening for specific antioxidant additives to the culture medium to reduce coloration. An in-vitro incubation model was used to screen antioxidant compounds, several of which were found to significantly reduce antibody color, while some led to significantly increased color. Hypotaurine and carboxymethylcysteine, which had the most significant color reducing effect in the incubation study, were further tested in small-scale bioreactor cell culture experiments. These studies demonstrated that these compounds lead to reduced coloration in cell culture without affecting cell growth and titer. Hypotaurine, hydrocortisone, peptone, and cystine were also shown to reduce the acidic charge variant levels, which was previously shown to correlate with color. \u00a9 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

This study aimed to determine the dose variation obtained from quartered hydrocortisone tablets when different operators performed the splitting procedure and to ascertain whether better uniformity could be attained from mini-tablets as an alternative formulation.Hydrocortisone 10\u2009mg tablets were quartered by four different operators using a standard pill splitter. Hydrocortisone 2.5\u2009mg mini-tablets (3\u2009mm diameter) were formulated using a wet granulation method and manufactured using a high-speed rotary press simulator. The weight and content uniformity of the quartered tablets and mini-tablets were assessed according to pharmacopoeial standards. The physical strength and dissolution profiles of the mini-tablets were also determined.More than half of all quartered 10\u2009mg tablets were outside of the \u00b110% of the stated US Pharmacopoeia hydrocortisone content (mean 2.34\u2009mg, SD 0.36, coefficient of variation (CV) 15.18%) and more than 40% of the quartered tablets were outside the European Pharmacopoeia weight variation. Robust mini-tablets (tensile strengths of >4\u2009MPa) were produced successfully. The mini-tablets passed the pharmacopoeial weight and content uniformity requirements (mean 2.54\u2009mg, SD 0.04, CV 1.72%) and drug release criteria during in vitro dissolution testing.This study confirmed that quartering 10\u2009mg hydrocortisone tablets produces unacceptable dose variations and that it is feasible to produce 3\u2009mm mini-tablets containing more accurate doses for paediatric patients."}

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "OBJECTIVE:To determine if corneal epithelial cell integrity is detrimentally affected by short-term administration of 1.0% morphine sulfate. Additionally, we sought to determine if topical 1.0% morphine applied to the equine cornea would result in ocular or systemic absorption. ANIMAL STUDIED:Six healthy horses. PROCEDURE:Morphine sulfate (1.0%) was applied topically to one eye every four hours for 72 h before horses were euthanized. Serum samples were collected at varying time points during the study and aqueous and vitreous humor were collected immediately after euthanasia. Morphine quantification in serum, aqueous, and vitreous humor was performed by ELISA. Treated and control corneas were submitted for histopathology. Horses were monitored for adverse ocular and systemic effects throughout the study period. RESULTS:All horses developed mild mucoid ocular discharge in the treated eye. One horse developed a fever during treatment. Morphine was detected in the aqueous humor of the treated eye for all horses with mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 165.18 ng/mL \u00b1 87.69 ng/mL. Morphine was detected in vitreous humor of the treated eye of 5 of 6 horses with mean \u00b1 standard deviation of 4.87 \u00b1 4.46 ng/mL. Morphine was detected in the serum of 5 of 6 horses at varying time points. Maximum systemic concentration reached in a single horse was 6.98 ng/mL. Corneal histopathology revealed no difference in microscopic appearance between morphine-treated and control corneas. CONCLUSIONS:Topical administration of 1.0% morphine sulfate did not appear to cause any significant ocular or systemic adverse effects. Topical ophthalmic morphine application resulted in both ocular and systemic absorption."}

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "Although contraindicated, coingestion of alcohol and opioids by patients or drug abusers is a major health concern because of dangerous additive and potentially life-threatening sedative and respiratory effects. In addition, alcohol has been shown to disrupt the extended-release characteristics of certain extended-release opioid formulations, releasing a hazardous amount of opioid over a short time period. Morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules (MS-sNT), which contain naltrexone sequestered in each pellet core, are indicated for management of chronic, moderate to severe pain. Sequestered naltrexone is designed for release upon product tampering (crushing) to potentially mitigate morphine-induced subjective effects. This open-label, single-dose, 4-way crossover, pharmacokinetic drug interaction study compared the relative bioavailability of morphine and naltrexone when MS-sNT is administered (under fasting conditions) with increasing doses of alcohol. Thirty-two healthy, opioid-naive adults were randomized to MS-sNT administered with 240 mL of 4%, 20%, or 40% alcohol or water. No drug interaction was found between morphine in MS-sNT and 4% or 20% alcohol. Administration with 40% alcohol did not affect overall morphine exposure but was associated with a 2-fold increase in C(max) and reduction of t(max) from 9 to 4 hours versus MS-sNT taken with water. Naltrexone sequestering was successful in all treatment arms and not affected by coadministration with alcohol over the dose range tested."}
{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "INTRODUCTION: Morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules, indicated for chronic moderate-to-severe pain, contain extended-release morphine pellets with a sequestered naltrexone core. If pellets are tampered by crushing, naltrexone is released to reduce morphine-induced effects that appeal to opioid abusers. The primary objective of this study was to assess single-dose relative bioavailability of morphine when morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules were taken under fed and fasting conditions and when pellets were sprinkled on apple sauce. METHODS: This was a single-center, randomized, open-label study in 36 healthy adult volunteers. Subjects took a 100-mg morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsule intact with 240 mL water, under fed and fasted conditions, and when the capsule was opened and pellets were sprinkled over apple sauce and consumed without chewing; each treatment was separated by a 14-day washout. Plasma samples were collected just before dosing through 72 hours postdose for pharmacokinetic analyses of morphine, and through 168 hours postdose for naltrexone and its major metabolite 6-\u03b2-naltrexol. RESULTS: Morphine bioavailability was similar for all treatments. There was a lack of sprinkle effect (sprinkle vs. whole, fasted); 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of ratios of log-transformed least squares means for area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) fell within 80%-125% boundaries. For the food effect, 90% CIs were within the boundaries for AUC, but C(max) was reduced and time to C(max) was delayed by 2.5 hours under fed conditions. Naltrexone remained sequestered under all treatment conditions with only trace systemic exposure. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules can be administered without regard to meals, and contents can be sprinkled over apple sauce and consumed without chewing by patients with difficulty swallowing."}

If the product is tampered with by crushing, naltrexone, a \u03bc-opioid antagonist, is intended for release to mitigate morphine-induced subjective effects. The primary end point of this randomized 2-way crossover study in healthy fasted volunteers was evaluation of morphine bioequivalence between MS-sNT (treatment A) and morphine sulfate extended release capsules (KADIAN\u00ae, treatment B). Morphine pharmacokinetics were assessed predose to 72 hours postdose of single 100-mg doses of treatment A or B. Analysis of variance of ln-transformed ratios of least squares mean of the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) from time 0 to last measurable concentration (AUC0-t) and AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUCinf) and maximum serum concentration (Cmax) for treatments A versus B were performed.

When subjects who vomited during the 12-hour dosing interval were excluded, the confidence interval for AUC0-t and AUCinf fell within the 80%-125% range, but the lower limit for Cmax was 76.9%."}
{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "Recent data have shown that rapid release of active drug (i.e., dose-dumping) can occur when modified-release formulations of pain medications, and other extended-release pharmacotherapies, are exposed to ethanol in vitro. Dose-dumping of sustained-release opioids is of particular concern because of the risk for serious and potentially fatal adverse events. Sustained-release morphine sulfate tablets (Oramorph SR, 15, 30, 60, and 100 mg; Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Newport, KY) were incubated in vitro at simulated physiologic conditions in media containing no ethanol or ethanol in concentrations ranging from 4%-40% v/v. Morphine sulfate release was measured over the course of 1 to 24 hours using a high-performance liquid chromatography method (United States Pharmacopeia). The sustained-release morphine sulfate tablets exhibited no evidence of active drug dose-dumping. Regardless of ethanol concentration, ethanol exposure did not increase the rate of release of morphine sulfate. Release of approximately 20%-25% of the morphine sulfate dose within 1 hour was consistent among the morphine doses tested and ethanol concentrations. Release of morphine sulfate from the 60- and 100-mg tablets exposed to the higher ethanol concentrations (20% and 40% ethanol) was slightly delayed at all time points beyond 1 hour. The results of this in vitro study suggest that ethanol concentrations as high as 40% do not substantially alter the sustained-release properties of the morphine sulfate tablets."}
{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended-release capsules (EMBEDA, King Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol, TN), indicated for management of chronic, moderate-to-severe pain, contain pellets of extended-release morphine sulfate with a sequestered naltrexone core (MS-sNT). Taken as directed, morphine provides analgesia while naltrexone remains sequestered; if tampered with by crushing, naltrexone is released to mitigate morphine-induced euphoric effects. While it is necessary to establish that formulations intended to reduce attractiveness for abuse are successful in doing so, it is also necessary to demonstrate that product therapeutic integrity is maintained for patients. OBJECTIVES: Data were reviewed from 3 studies to determine: 1) the quantity of naltrexone released when MS-sNT pellets are crushed (MS-sNTC) for at least 2 minutes with mortar and pestle); 2) the extent to which the naltrexone released upon crushing mitigated morphine-induced subjective effects; and 3) whether sequestered naltrexone precipitates opioid withdrawal when MS-sNT is taken as directed. METHODS: The naltrexone bioavailability study compared naltrexone release from MS-sNTC with that from whole intact MS-sNT capsules (MS-sNTW) and an equal naltrexone solution (NS) dose. Equivalent bioavailability was established if 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for geometric mean ratios (maximum plasma naltrexone concentration [Cmax] and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity [AUC\u221e]) fell between 80% and 125%. The oral pharmacodynamic study assessed drug liking and euphoria and pharmacokinetic properties of MS-sNTC and MS-sNTW compared with morphine sulfate solution (MSS) and placebo. The 12-month, open-label (OL) safety study evaluated safety of MS-sNT administered orally as directed in patients with chronic, moderate-to-severe pain. Safety assessments included withdrawal symptoms based on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). RESULTS: Naltrexone from MS-sNTC met criteria for equivalent bioavailability to NS. Although morphine relative bioavailability was similar for MS-sNTC and MSS, mean peak (Emax) visual analog scale (VAS) scores for drug liking and Cole/Addiction Research Center Inventory Stimulation-Euphoria were significantly reduced for MS-sNTC vs MSS (p < 0.001). In these 2 studies, a total of 6 participants had one measurement of plasma naltrexone after MS-sNTW that was above the lower limit of quantification. In the OL safety study, 72/93 participants (77%) had no quantifiable naltrexone concentrations. There was neither evidence of naltrexone accumulation for any participant nor any significant correlation with MS-sNT dose, age, or sex. Of 4 participants with the highest naltrexone concentrations, none had COWS scores consistent with moderate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Only 5 participants had COWS scores consistent with moderate opioid withdrawal; all 5 had not taken MS-sNT as directed. LIMITATIONS: Study populations may not be fully representative of patients receiving opioid therapy for the management of chronic, moderate-to-severe pain and of opioid abusers. CONCLUSIONS: When MS-sNT capsules are crushed, all of the sequestered naltrexone (relative to oral NS) is released and immediately available to mitigate morphine-induced effects. When MS-sNT was crushed, the naltrexone released abated drug liking and euphoria relative to that from an equal dose of immediate-release morphine from MSS administration in a majority of participants. Naltrexone concentrations were low over a period of 12 months without evidence of accumulation, and there were no observable opioid withdrawal symptoms when MS-sNT was taken as directed."}

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "BACKGROUND: Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules (KADIAN) contain polymer-coated morphine sulfate pellets that are formulated to deliver sustained plasma morphine levels with minimal fluctuation. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, the only opioid formulation indicated in the US for both once- and twice-daily (every 12 and every 24 h) dosing, is approved in eight dosage strengths and is effective against pain from diverse sources in a variety of patient types. The formulation of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules allows flexible dosing options: capsules can be taken whole or the contents can be sprinkled on apple sauce or delivered via a gastrostomy tube. Morphine sulfate extended-release capsules have no immediate-release component and no components that would limit high doses. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: The bioavailability of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules is not compromised when taken with food and dose dumping (immediate elevations in dose) does not occur when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are taken concomitantly with alcohol. Nearly all patients taking morphine sulfate extended-release capsules for pain relief adhere to the recommended dosing frequency. The flexibility available with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules may offer clinical advantages for pain management."}

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "Narcotic analgesics play an important role in the treatment of pain. If the drug is not standardized, it is easy to cause tolerance and addiction, so scientific management and rational application is very important. In this article, we analyzed the use of narcotic analgesics in a tertiary hospital in 2015-2017. The results showed that the top 3 drugs in DDDs (defined daily doses) were fentanyl transdermal patch (4.2 mg), fentanyl transdermal patch (8.4 mg) and morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets (30 mg). Because of its strong analgesic activity and dosage form, fentanyl has become one of the first choices for severe and moderate pain in clinical practice. Morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets (30 mg) DDDs ranked third in 2015-2017, and the B/A value was 1.75. At the same time, morphine sulfate sustained-release tablets' DDDs declined in 2017 because of the analgesic advantage of bucinnazine hydrochloride injection in emergency treatment. The dosage of pethidine hydrochloride injection is declining year by year, because its analgesic action time is very short and easy to be addicted to, and the long-term application of its metabolite, normethidine, will accumulate in the body, causing neurotoxic symptoms. The price of oxycodone hydrochloride prolonged-release tablets is relatively high, which limits its use to a certain extent. Therefore, recommend rational use of narcotic analgesics in hospitals."}
{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "Morphine sulfate is often administered for patients requiring surgical intervention for the control of hemorrhage. Recent data implicate morphine as an immune modulator that affects white blood cells and increases infection rates. In addition, morphine releases histamine, an inflammatory mediator that increases microvascular permeability. Both of these actions of morphine could aggravate the inflammatory progress after hemorrhagic shock. In this study, we evaluated the role of morphine sulfate on microvascular permeability and its effects on leukocyte adherence after hemorrhagic shock. After a control period, blood was withdrawn to reduce the mean arterial blood pressure to 40 mm Hg for 1 h in urethane-anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Mesenteric postcapillary venules in a transilluminated segment of small intestine were examined to quantify changes in permeability and leukocyte adherence. The rats received an IV injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine albumin during the control period. The fluorescent light intensity emitted from the fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine albumin was recorded with digital microscopy within the lumen of the microvasculature and compared with the intensity of light in the extraluminal space over time. These images were downloaded to a computerized image analysis program that quantitates changes in light intensity. This change in light intensity represents albumin extravasation. In addition, bright-field images were recorded on compact disk for playback to determine leukocyte adherence. Leukocytes stationary for more than 30 s or longer in a 100-micron segment of venule was considered adherent. Our results demonstrated a marked increase in fluorescein isothiocyanate-bovine albumin leakage into the extravascular space after hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock was also associated with an increase in leukocytes adhering to the postcapillary venular endothelium. Morphine sulfate 10 microg/kg given before the shock period, attenuated both the hyperpermeability (P < 0.05) and the increase in leukocyte adherence (P < 0.05) after hemorrhagic shock. These results suggest that instead of aggravating the inflammatory response after hemorrhagic shock, morphine may provide protection to the microvasculature."}

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Morphine sulfate controlled-released tablet and morphine hydrochloride sustained-released tablet are preferred medicines for treating moderate-severe cancer pain. There are some differences between the two medicines in their efficacy, metabolism and adverse events. This study was to compare the efficacy and toxicities between morphine sulfate controlled-released tablet and morphine hydrochloride sustained-released tablet in treating moderate-severe cancer pain. METHODS: A total of 121 patients with moderate-severe cancer pain were randomized into two groups: 61 were treated with morphine sulfate controlled-released tablet and 60 were treated with morphine hydrochloride sustained-released tablet. Analgesic efficacy and toxicities of the two medicines were observed. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients treated with morphine sulfate controlled-released tablet, 12 had moderate pain, 49 had severe pain; the total response rate was 91.80%. Of the 60 patients treated with morphine hydrochloride sustained-released tablet, 13 had moderate pain, 47 had severe pain; the total response rate was 91.67%. There was no significant difference in the efficacy between the two medicines. Digestive system adverse events, including nausea, vomiting and constipation, were more common in morphine hydrochloride sustained-released tablet group than in morphine sulfate controlled-released tablet group (66.66% vs. 34.43%, P<0.05).

{"keyword": "Morphine sulfate", "texts": "CONTEXT: Morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride extended release capsules contain extended-release pellets of morphine with a sequestered naltrexone core (MS-sNT). Taken whole, as intended, morphine is released to provide pain relief; if tampered with by crushing, naltrexone is released to mitigate subjective effects of morphine. OBJECTIVES: This open-label study assessed long-term (12-month) safety of MS-sNT in patients with chronic, moderate to severe pain. METHODS: Safety assessments included determining adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessments, and the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS). Analgesic efficacy was assessed (diary) as worst, least, average, and current pain using an 11-point numeric scale (0=none; 10=worst). RESULTS: Of 465 patients receiving one or more doses, 160 completed the study. Most patients (81.3%) experienced one or more AEs, most commonly constipation (31.8%) or nausea (25.2%). Thirty-three patients (7.1%) reported serious AEs; one patient's severe gastrointestinal inflammation and colitis were considered possibly study drug-related. Most discontinuations (30%) occurred in the first month, most often because of AEs (23.7%). There were no clinically relevant changes in laboratory results or vital signs, and no clinically significant electrocardiogram changes deemed study drug-related. During each visit after Week 1, 5% or fewer patients had COWS scores indicating mild withdrawal symptoms (range, 0%-4.8%). Five patients, who did not take the study drug as instructed, had scores consistent with moderate withdrawal. MS-sNT yielded statistically significant improvements from baseline in mean scores for all pain diary items for all visits, except Week 1 for least pain. CONCLUSION: In this study population, when MS-sNT was taken as directed for chronic, moderate to severe pain for up to 12 months, most AEs were typical opioid-related side effects. Mean COWS scores remained low, indicating lack of\u00a0withdrawal symptoms and appropriate transition off the study drug at completion."}
